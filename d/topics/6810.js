Typically, the inadequate cerebral nutrient flow is of relatively brief duration (8 to 10 seconds), and, in syncope, is by definition spontaneously self-limited. </p><p>Loss of postural tone is inevitable with loss of consciousness, and consequently syncope usually is associated with collapse, which may trigger injury due to a fall (such as may occur if the person is standing) or other type of accident (eg, if syncope occurs while driving). Recovery from true syncope is usually complete and rapid, with episodes rarely lasting more than a minute or two. Longer periods of real or apparent loss of consciousness suggest that the event is not syncope or is not syncope alone (eg, syncope resulting in a head injury, thereby prolonging the event).</p><p>Syncope is only one on the many potential causes of TLOC. Examples of non-syncopal causes of TLOC, or apparent TLOC, include seizure disorders, traumatic brain injury (ie, concussion), intoxications, metabolic disturbances, and conversion disorders (ie, psychogenic &quot;pseudo-syncope&quot; or &quot;pseudo-seizures&quot;). Distinguishing these conditions from true syncope may be challenging, but it is crucial in order to determine appropriate management.</p><p>True syncope itself has many possible causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66884 \">table 1</a>). Consequently, after the syncopal event has resolved and the patient is hemodynamically stable, the essential next step is establishing the etiology in order to initiate an appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategy to prevent future events as well as to determine prognosis. The initial evaluation of suspected syncope relies heavily on obtaining of a comprehensive history, performing a physical examination (which may include careful carotid sinus massage in older patients), and reviewing an electrocardiogram; these steps should guide the subsequent diagnostic evaluation and help limit unnecessary testing and treatment. </p><p>Issues relating to the evaluation of syncope in adults will be reviewed here. The approach to the adult patients with syncope in the emergency department, as well as the pathogenesis, etiology, and management of syncope in adults, are discussed elsewhere.

Nonetheless, the symptoms that patients do experience (eg, lightheadedness, feeling unstable in the upright position, nausea, feeling hot or cold, etc) may be very disconcerting. Presyncope usually lasts only for seconds and is often described by the patient as &quot;nearly blacking out&quot; or &quot;nearly fainting.&quot;</p><p/><p>The classic prodromal symptoms associated with imminent syncope and presyncope, particularly in the case of the vasovagal form of reflex syncope, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lightheadedness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feeling of being warm or cold </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or non-specific abdominal discomfort </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual &quot;blurring&quot; occasionally proceeding to temporary darkening or &quot;white-out&quot; of vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminution of hearing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occurrence of unusual sounds (particularly a &quot;whooshing&quot; noise)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pallor reported by onlookers</p><p/><p>On some occasions, patients may have no warning symptoms at all or (especially in older individuals who may be amnestic for the symptoms) may not have any recollection of premonitory symptoms. The absence of warning is often associated with cardiac causes of syncope and increases the chances of the syncopal event resulting in injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14005354\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of patients with transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) and suspected syncope serves both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The clinician has the opportunity to both ascertain whether the collapse was likely true syncope, and also determine whether the affected patient should be admitted to the hospital or can be safely managed in the outpatient environment (ie, &quot;risk stratification&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78397 \">table 3</a>). For nearly all patients, the initial evaluation of suspected syncope should include obtaining a comprehensive history, performance of a physical examination (which may include careful carotid sinus massage in older patients), and review of an electrocardiogram. A transthoracic echocardiogram is useful to evaluate for the presence and severity of structural heart disease if structural heart disease status is uncertain, after completion of a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Additional diagnostic evaluation, if indicated, should be individualized based upon the suspected etiology of syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>Once it is determined that a patient has suffered true syncope, establishing the most likely etiology of the syncope is the next step. In this regard, it is important to remember that many patients have multiple co-morbidities which can contribute to TLOC, and consequently there may be multiple plausible causes of syncope that require careful assessment. An observed abnormality should not be assumed to be the cause of collapse without first giving careful consideration to alternative diagnoses and interactions among various co-existing conditions. For example, orthostatic hypotension is common among older patients, but susceptibility to syncope may be the result of medications that the patient has been prescribed, an intercurrent illness, or even a previously unsuspected arrhythmia that undermines the individual's hemodynamic stability. </p><p>The efficacy of initial clinical evaluation is best summarized in professional society practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Overall, various reports suggest that an etiology for syncope may be obtained by a thorough evaluation in 45 to 65 percent of patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining a detailed medical history is the first step in determining whether apparent TLOC episodes are true syncope or some other cause of collapse. If the history obtained is thorough, the story provided by the patient (and witnesses, if any) will often reveal the most likely cause of syncope and will provide a means of guiding subsequent testing and treatment. However, history taking is highly dependent upon the experience of the clinician, and in addition depends on the whether the patient and witnesses can give an accurate account of events (which may be limited in patients who are very young, very elderly, uncomfortable [eg, pain], intoxicated, or in whom a language barrier exists).</p><p>Even under ideal circumstances, the sensitivity of the history-taking alone has not been well established. Consequently, confirmatory testing (albeit focused by virtue of having considered the historical findings) may be essential in order to confidently establish a diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3653001875\"><span class=\"h3\">Number, frequency, and duration of episodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number, frequency, duration (often difficult to determine accurately), and period of time (number of months or years) during which the patient has experienced presumed syncope events are important. In regard to the time period, the longer the period of time over which episodes have occurred (eg, many years versus very recent onset), the less likely that the cause of syncope is life-threatening. </p><p>Identifying any common threads with regard to associated symptoms, &quot;down time,&quot; or circumstances of onset can be helpful in suggesting an etiology. Certain &quot;benign&quot; causes of syncope (eg, vasovagal faint) may occur only once or very rarely in many patients, but some patients will have multiple episodes over many years, leading to an impaired quality of life and predisposing to injury. By comparison, the patient with multiple episodes occurring over a short period of time is more likely to be suffering from a serious underlying disorder (eg, intermittent high grade AV block, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, etc) and requires aggressive evaluation. As an additional consideration, individuals having many episodes of apparent &quot;syncope&quot; each day <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> episodes lasting many minutes in duration may be suffering from non-syncope psychogenic disorders (ie, now considered a syncope-mimic conversion reaction) rather than true syncope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3969609881\"><span class=\"h3\">Onset of syncope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who experience syncope have a period of symptoms of at least a few seconds or longer prior to losing consciousness, although some patients will suddenly lose consciousness without apparent warning. Extended symptoms with a classic prodrome (eg, nausea, sweating feeling hot or cold) are more commonly associated with the vasovagal form of reflex syncope, while sudden onset of syncope without a prodrome is more common among patients with cardiac syncope. Some patients, most often the more elderly individuals, may be amnestic following the event and unable to recall any prodrome, and therefore report sudden TLOC without warning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults and adolescents: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3220776133\"><span class=\"h3\">Position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessing the patient's position (ie, supine, sitting, or standing) at the time of syncope, along with any recent changes in position prior to syncope, provides clues to the etiology. Reflex syncope most commonly occurs when the patient is upright and almost never when supine. Syncope resulting from orthostatic hypotension is frequently associated with the change from a supine to erect posture, although several minutes may pass between the patient arising and the subsequent collapse. In comparison, syncope that occurs when the patient is supine suggests an arrhythmia and is inherently worrisome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1314519570\"><span class=\"h3\">Provocative factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should ask about circumstances at the time of syncope, as this information may identify possible triggers. For instance, the patient should be asked if syncope occurred:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During or immediately after exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During or immediately after urination, defecation, coughing or swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While in a warm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> crowded place</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During prolonged standing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the post-prandial period</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In association with emotional stress, fear, or intense pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately following abrupt neck movements</p><p/><p>Situational syncope is a type of reflex (neurally-mediated) syncope that occurs in the setting of an identifiable trigger. Examples include syncope during or immediately after coughing, swallowing, urinating, defecating, or when post-prandial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>In the case of carotid sinus hypersensitivity, abrupt neck movement may trigger a presumed carotid baroreceptor-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">vasodepressor/bradycardia,</span> leading to symptoms. Carotid sinus massage may suggest this susceptibility but should not be relied upon to establish the diagnosis unless other possible causes have been considered and excluded. Carotid sinus syncope is usually a condition of older patients (generally &gt;60 years of age with male predominance), or patients with prior head and neck surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid sinus hypersensitivity and carotid sinus syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Syncope that occurs during exertion suggests a potentially life-threatening arrhythmic etiology (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, etc) and should be taken very seriously. On the other hand, syncope after exertion (eg, during cooling off period) is more likely reflex in origin, similar to the vasovagal faint. A very detailed history is need to define the circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2959748255\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated symptoms preceding the event</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms preceding syncope can point toward a specific cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55096\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55096 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66884 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

In the case of syncope due to arrhythmia, this may occur in the supine or recumbent patient (almost never the case with other syncope mechanisms), but again the TLOC tends to be short-lived as the body's adaptive hemodynamic compensatory responses come into play. Recovery of consciousness may occur even if the arrhythmia is maintained.</p><p>Persistence of nausea, pallor, and diaphoresis in addition to a prolonged fatigue after the episode suggest a neurally-mediated reflex event (particularly a vasovagal episode). These findings are helpful in distinguishing reflex syncope from syncope due to an arrhythmia.

This approach is consistent with professional society guidelines, which recommend echocardiography in patients with syncope when structural cardiac disease is suspected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66884 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The primary factor determining whether the patient with presumed syncope should be hospitalized is the individual's immediate mortality risk, with secondary issues including the potential for physical injury (eg, fall risk) and, to a lesser extent, the issue of whether certain treatments require hospital monitoring for safe initiation. Patients can be classified as (1) high risk (requiring admission), (2) intermediate risk (admission is case-by-case dependent), and (3) low risk (patient can be evaluated as an outpatient). In all cases, arrangements for prompt outpatient care is essential. The development of <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;syncope/collapse&quot;</span> clinics has been shown to be helpful in this regard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665821707\"><span class=\"h3\">High risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several prognostic markers identify patients with syncope who should be hospitalized for evaluation and treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78397 \">table 3</a>). Syncope associated with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial ischemia, acute aortic dissection, decompensated congestive heart failure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suspicion of hemodynamically concerning underlying structural heart disease (eg, valvular aortic or mitral stenosis, severe pulmonary hypertension) have the highest immediate mortality and recurrence risk. Also at high risk are patients with syncope and certain ECG abnormalities, including high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, cardiac rhythm pauses of 3 to 5 seconds or greater, pre-excitation syndromes (eg, Wolff-Parkinson White Syndrome), suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), or evidence suggestive of a primary arrhythmia syndrome (eg, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, short QT syndrome, etc). Patients with syncope during exercise, or while lying down, and those with syncope causing motor vehicle accidents or severe injury, should generally be considered for in-hospital evaluation unless the history strongly supports the diagnosis of exercise variant of neurally-mediated reflex syncope. Risk stratification of patients with syncope presenting to the emergency department using prediction tools is discussed separately.

Often patients have symptoms that are not consistent with classic vasovagal or reflex-mediated syncope, thereby raising cardiac syncope as a possible etiology. Decisions regarding the need for hospitalization and further evaluation and treatment are often made in such patients on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548037075\"><span class=\"h3\">Low risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients considered to be at low risk of mortality or recurrent syncope resulting in injury typically have no evidence of structural heart disease and have a normal baseline ECG. In most cases, the syncope is thought to be neurally-mediated reflex syncope or orthostatic syncope, both of which are generally considered relatively benign with regard to the risk of early mortality or recurrent syncope resulting in injury, but not necessarily with regard to falls and injury. Most of the time these patients can be treated and discharged home for further outpatient evaluation as needed, along with plans for prompt outpatient follow-up. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415063056\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES OF THE INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of the patient with suspected transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) or syncope may result in one of several possible outcomes: a certain basis for symptoms, a suspected basis for symptoms, or an unknown or unexplained cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3949873066\"><span class=\"h2\">Certain diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of the time, the initial evaluation leads to a relatively certain diagnosis of the cause of TLOC. Patients with a certain diagnosis generally do not require further diagnostic evaluation, although on occasion one confirmatory test may be warranted. </p><p>Examples of situations in which the clinician feels comfortable that the diagnosis of the basis of syncope has been established based on initial evaluation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic vasovagal syncope in which precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, or emotional distress are associated with typical prodromal symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Situational syncope such as occurs after urinating, defecating, coughing, or swallowing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic (postural) syncope in which there is documentation by history of postural change leading to presumed orthostatic hypotension associated with syncope or pre-syncope. The presence of orthostatic blood pressure (BP) changes during office examination, with associated reproduction of symptoms, may help to confirm the diagnosis, but since a patient's drug and volume status may not be the same in the clinic as at the time of spontaneous symptoms, the absence of a diagnostic blood pressure drop during the medical examination does not exclude the diagnosis of orthostatic (postural) syncope. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmia-related syncope when there is documented electrocardiogram (ECG) evidence of a significant tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia or malfunctioning pacemaker.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H994298735\"><span class=\"h2\">Suspected diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In approximately 30 percent of cases, the initial evaluation will reveal clues in the history or abnormalities on the physical exam or ECG that result in a suspected diagnosis for the <span class=\"nowrap\">TLOC/syncope</span>. These patients then have a suspected but as yet uncertain (or unconfirmed) cause of TLOC. Nevertheless, the suspected diagnosis is valuable in guiding the subsequent evaluation strategy. &#160; </p><p>For patients with a suspected but as yet uncertain diagnosis after the initial evaluation, specific confirmatory testing is warranted in order to solidify the diagnosis, or conversely to exclude the diagnosis. Such testing may also aid in the planning of treatment. Tilt-table testing is an example of a &quot;confirmatory&quot; test, which is often used when the diagnosis of a neurally-mediated reflex syncope is suspected, but the presentation is not classical. In this regard, only about 40 percent of the presumed vasovagal syncopes are typical. The majority of vasovagal syncopes are only suspected by the experienced clinician after other causes have been eliminated. The utility of tilt-testing is controversial, and many centers do not rely on such testing. However, as our knowledge base regarding the usefulness and limitations of such testing has grown, many practitioners use the test as part of the overall diagnostic assessment. If used, tilt-testing is of most value in individuals without evident structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1812125933\"><span class=\"h2\">Unexplained diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the initial evaluation, including history, physical examination, and ECG, are completely non-diagnostic in a patient with TLOC and suspected syncope, the patient is considered to have an unexplained diagnosis, which occurs in approximately 20 percent of cases. In such patients, the strategy for subsequent assessment varies according to the severity and frequency of the episodes and the presence or absence of heart disease. The presence of heart disease has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiac cause of syncope, with a sensitivity of 95 percent and a specificity of 45 percent; by contrast, the absence of heart disease excludes a cardiac cause of syncope in 97 percent of patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>No evidence of structural heart disease</strong> &ndash; The majority of patients with single or rare episodes of syncope and an unexplained diagnosis probably have reflex syncope (most often vasovagal syncope). Apart from advice regarding recognition of episodes and preventing or avoiding &quot;triggers,&quot; more aggressive treatment measures are generally not needed. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with multiple recurrences of syncope and an unexplained diagnosis in the absence of structural heart disease, and who have a normal ECG, reflex syncope remains the most probable diagnosis. At this stage, if the etiology is in doubt, tilt-table testing and carotid sinus massage may be helpful. Tilt-table testing is principally directed at unmasking susceptibility to the vasovagal syncope, but its value for assessing susceptibility to other types of reflex syncope (ie, situational syncope) is less well established. Carotid sinus massage is exclusively directed to assessing the possibility of carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH) and carotid sinus syndrome (the latter being syncope symptoms attributable to CSH). Carotid sinus syndrome is usually a condition of older (&gt;60 years, mainly male) persons unless the patient has had prior neck surgery or irradiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Psychiatric assessment may be helpful for patients with frequent recurrences of apparent TLOC, especially if the episodes are reported to be very long in duration (often &gt;5 minutes) and occur many times per day or week. The diagnosis is most likely <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;pseudo-syncope/pseudo-seizures&quot;;</span> this diagnosis is further supported if the patient also has multiple other somatic complaints and is concerned about excessive stress. A past history of physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual abuse has been reported to be present in approximately 25 percent of these patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with signs of autonomic failure or neurological disease, a specific neurological diagnosis should be sought by involving the appropriate neurologic consultant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Known structural heart disease or an abnormal ECG</strong> &ndash; In patients with known structural heart disease, or those who have an abnormal ECG suggestive of underlying structural heart disease, transthoracic echocardiography (if not already done) is important. Stress testing may be warranted if ischemic heart disease is suspected <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the syncope occurred during exertion (ie, in &quot;full flight&quot; not after termination of exertion). In many instances, prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring will be needed. The choice of ambulatory ECG monitoring system is largely dependent on the frequency with which events occur. In the case of very rare events, an implantable loop recorder may be best. In any event, the choice should be on a case-by-case basis using the history and clinical experience as a guide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTED ADDITIONAL TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If additional diagnostic testing is deemed necessary following the initial evaluation, the choice of testing should be individualized and based on the results of initial assessment, rather than taking a standardized approach to testing in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. By using this approach, low-yield testing can be avoided in many patients, thereby reducing the likelihood of false positive testing and enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the evaluation. </p><p>A number of diagnostic tests are potentially useful, but each test is to be chosen selectively to address a suspected diagnosis or diagnoses. Since syncope is by definition a cardiovascular issue, the meaningful tests are mostly cardiovascular in nature. Neurologic testing is generally of low yield and historically has been overused, unless the history or physical examination suggest a specific non-syncope neurological issue such as a seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. On the other hand, neurologic consultation is often necessary in idiopathic orthostatic hypotension in which an underlying neurological disease such as Parkinson's disease or Pure Autonomic Failure may be discovered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms, causes, and evaluation of orthostatic hypotension&quot;, section on 'Autonomic failure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Ambulatory ECG monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is warranted when there is suspicion that a cardiac arrhythmia may be the cause of syncope. However, the choice of monitor system depends on the expected frequency of symptom events. Thus, unless symptoms are occurring daily, a 24- or 48-hour Holter is not likely to be useful in making a diagnosis. Even in-hospital monitoring for one to three days may be non-productive. In cases of significant but infrequent symptoms, longer-term ambulatory monitoring systems are more likely to be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Continuous ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitoring devices have patient-activated event markers, and encoded time or time markers, and may be helpful in patients with daily or near daily symptoms.

Consequently, Holter monitor recording has almost no value in this setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Event (loop) monitoring</strong> &ndash; Event monitors, historically called loop monitors because the recording device continuously looped its recording tape, are most commonly used for patients with less frequent (ie, weekly to monthly) symptoms of palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. Typically utilized for two to four weeks (although possibly up to three months), event monitors are small, lightweight devices carried by the patient with electrodes to be applied when symptoms arise.

Careful massage of the neck at the angle of the mandible by an experienced clinician (both sides at separate times) may unmask carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Carotid sinus syndrome is diagnosed if carotid sinus hypersensitivity is present (usually a sinus pause &gt;3 to 5 seconds <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a blood pressure fall of &gt;50 mmHg) with reproduction of symptoms (the latter requires the patient to be upright when tested) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69426 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Although there is little evidence of risk, most current guidelines indicate that most practitioners should avoid carotid sinus massage in patients with history of transient ischemic attack or stroke within the past three months and in patients with carotid bruits (except if carotid Doppler studies have previously excluded significant carotid stenosis). However, this procedure can be performed safely and with useful diagnostic effect by experienced clinicians.

However, some patients with structural heart disease may already have an indication for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and therefore EPS may not be needed.

However, neurologic consultation may be helpful to identify certain disorders (eg, Parkinson's disease, pure autonomic failure) that may predispose to orthostatic syncope or syncope during exertion. Other neurologic disorders (eg, seizures) can cause TLOC that may be confused with syncope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76023 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>As a rule, neurologic tests (eg, electroencephalogram [EEG], brain computed tomography scan, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and carotid Doppler ultrasound), are ordered more frequently than is appropriate. In one review of 649 patients, 53 percent had at least one neurologic test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Such testing is rarely useful.</p><p>The 2009 ESC guidelines recommended neurologic referral in patients in whom transient loss of consciousness is suspected to be epilepsy rather than syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, neurologic referral to evaluate the underlying disease is indicated when syncope is due to autonomic failure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201833173\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>How can syncope be differentiated from other causes of TLOC?</strong> &ndash; By definition, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) due to inadequate cerebral nutrient flow. In the vast majority of cases the underlying cause is a temporary but self-limited drop in systemic blood pressure. Other causes of loss of consciousness such as head trauma, seizures, intoxications, or metabolic disorders are the result of other causes. Distinguishing syncope from these other conditions can only be accomplished with careful diagnostic assessment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What presentation is suggestive of a cardiac cause of syncope?</strong> &ndash; The key factors suggesting a cardiac origin of syncope include the presence of structural heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a major ECG abnormality (including conduction system disease, preexcitation, and channelopathies such as <span class=\"nowrap\">long/short</span> QT syndromes, and Brugada syndrome). Clinical history markers include syncope while supine or during exertion (ie, in full flight, not after completion of exertion), faints preceded by palpitations (although reflex faints may also have this feature), and a family history of sudden death. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What type of ECG monitoring should be used?</strong> &ndash; Ambulatory ECG monitoring can be very valuable in an effort to establish or exclude an arrhythmic cause of syncope. However, there are a variety of possible ambulatory ECG monitors to choose from (eg, Holter-type, event monitors, Mobile continuous outpatient telemetry [MCOT], and insertable loop recorders [ILRs]). The choice among these technologies must be based on the suspected monitoring duration that will be required to capture a spontaneous symptom event. Thus if symptoms occur daily, a 24- to 48-hour Holter may be adequate. If symptoms occur weekly or monthly, a MCOT recorder is best. If symptoms only occur a few times per year, then an ILR (with up to a three-year battery longevity) is best. Typical event recorders may not be useful at all if the patient collapses and cannot activate the device. Consequently, a device that can activate on its own in the setting of an arrhythmia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has a loop memory to retain information for later download is preferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What is the yield of ECG monitoring?</strong> &ndash; ILRs have the best yield (up to a 75 percent detection rate for the cause of syncope at three years) as they monitor patients for up to three years, do not need to be removed during certain activities such as showering or swimming, and may identify significant cardiac rhythm abnormalities when the patients is sleeping. MCOT systems are the next most productive as they will record and transmit findings without patient initiation of the transmission. Holter monitors (24 to 48 hours) are relatively ineffective unless events occur daily. Conventional event recorders without loop memory storage are also relatively ineffective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What echocardiographic findings are diagnostic of cause of syncope?</strong> &ndash; In general, echocardiographic findings are used to identify the presence of structural heart disease, but they do not provide a specific causal diagnosis in syncope patients. However, certain findings may be exceptions to this rule (or at least provide findings that are considered highly suspicious of the diagnostic cause), including left atrial myxomas, severe aortic valvular stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, marked pulmonary arterial hypertension, certain forms of congenital heart disease such as abnormal origin of the coronary arteries, and pericardial tamponade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>How can orthostatic blood pressure changes distinguish among various causes of syncope?</strong> &ndash; Measurement of blood pressure, including orthostatic blood pressure measurement, is an essential component of the syncope evaluation. As a rule, blood pressure should first be measured when the patient is supine, then after standing for one to two minutes, and again after standing four to five minutes (preferably using a noninvasive device that provides beat-to-beat blood pressure measurements). A drop of systolic pressure &gt;20 mmHg (&gt;30 mmHg in hypertensive patients) is considered diagnostic of orthostatic hypotension. However, such a finding should not be considered definitive proof of the etiology of syncope unless it is consistent with the patient's medical history (ie, faints triggered immediately after standing, or faints occurring after prolonged upright posture in absence of other explanation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What is the utility of tilt-table testing?</strong> The utility of tilt-testing is controversial, and many centers do not rely on such testing. However, while classic vasovagal syncope can be identified by the medical history, many cases are not classic; this is particularly the case in older individuals. Further, many centers undertake other autonomic testing maneuvers in conjunction with the &quot;tilt-table test.&quot; In such cases, they assess the patient's overall autonomic status and thereby provide a much more comprehensive assessment of possible causes of syncope. As our knowledge base regarding the usefulness and limitations of such testing has grown, many practitioners use the test as part of the overall diagnostic assessment. In any event, if used, tilt-testing is of most value in individuals without evident structural heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What is the role of neurologic tests in <span class=\"nowrap\">TLOC/syncope?</strong></span> &ndash; TLOC includes several conditions that may warrant neurologic testing. Head trauma and epilepsy are the most important examples as they may be associated with true loss of consciousness, whereas other neurologic conditions (eg, transient ischemic attacks) are not. In true syncope (which is a cardiovascular disorder), neurologic diagnostic tests are not needed in the absence of a concern related to syncope-induced head injury. Syncope is not a primary neurological condition in the vast majority of cases, and tests such as head imaging or EEG are not likely to provide a diagnosis and as a consequence are not cost-effective. Neurologic consultation is warranted if autonomic failure (eg, primary autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease) is deemed a possible underlying cause.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1793777798\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Typically the period of time with inadequate cerebral nutrient flow is relatively brief and, by definition, self-limited. Most often, syncope is the result of cerebral hypo-perfusion due to transient hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possible causes of TLOC resulting in true syncope are generally grouped into four major categories, including reflex (neurally-mediated) syncope, orthostatic syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, and structural cardiopulmonary disease. Conditions that mimic <span class=\"nowrap\">TLOC/syncope</span> but are not true syncope include seizures, sleep disturbances, accidental falls, and some psychiatric conditions. (See <a href=\"#H1045568519\" class=\"local\">'Causes of syncope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features associated with a syncopal event are important and may be diagnostic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55096\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55096 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66884 \">table 1</a>). On some occasions, patients may have no warning symptoms at all; however, the classic prodromal symptoms associated with syncope and presyncope, particularly in the case of the vasovagal form of reflex syncope, include lightheadedness, a feeling of being warm or cold, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea, visual blurring, and diminution of hearing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occurrence of unusual (often &quot;whooshing&quot;) sounds. (See <a href=\"#H3000682699\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nearly all patients, the initial evaluation of suspected syncope should include obtaining a comprehensive history, performing a physical examination (which may include careful carotid sinus massage in older patients), and review of an electrocardiogram. A transthoracic echocardiogram is useful to evaluate for the presence and severity of structural heart disease (SHD) if SHD status is uncertain, or if SHD is known, or is suspected based on the results of the history, physical examination, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). Additional diagnostic evaluation, if indicated, should be individualized based upon the suspected etiology of syncope. (See <a href=\"#H14005354\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obtaining a detailed medical history is the first step in determining whether apparent TLOC episodes are true syncope or some other cause of collapse. If the history taking is careful and thorough, the story provided by the patient (and witnesses, if any) will often reveal the most likely cause of syncope, and will provide a means of guiding subsequent testing and treatment. Key features of the medical history include the number, frequency, and duration of episodes; information about the onset, position, provocative factors, and associated symptoms before and after the event; witnessed signs by observers; and pre-existing medical conditions including medication use and family history. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Medical history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A number of findings on physical examination can aid in the identification of some of the common causes of syncope, including abnormalities in the vital signs, cardiovascular abnormalities, and less frequently neurological signs. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An ECG should be obtained in all patients with suspected syncope. The 12-lead ECG only rarely identifies a specific arrhythmic cause of syncope, although certain findings (eg, persistent bradycardia &lt;40 beats per minute, high grade atrioventricular block, ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia with rapid ventricular rate, pacemaker malfunction, etc) are considered diagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wherever the initial syncope evaluation leads, clinicians must determine whether the affected individual needs in-hospital care for further evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> initiation of treatment. The primary factor determining whether the patient with presumed syncope should be hospitalized is the individual's immediate mortality risk, with secondary issues including the potential for physical injury (eg, fall risk) and, to a lesser extent, the issue of whether certain treatments require hospital monitoring for safe initiation. Patients can be classified as high risk (requiring admission), intermediate risk (admission is case-by-case dependent), and low risk (patient can be evaluated as an outpatient). (See <a href=\"#H16427095\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of the patient with suspected transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) or syncope may result in one of several possible outcomes: a certain basis for symptoms (approximately 50 percent), a suspected basis for symptoms (approximately 30 percent), or an unknown or unexplained cause (approximately 20 percent). (See <a href=\"#H415063056\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of the initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If additional diagnostic testing is deemed necessary following the initial evaluation, the choice of testing should be individualized and based on the results of initial assessment, rather than taking a standardized approach to testing in all patients. By using this approach, low-yield testing can be avoided in many patients, thereby reducing the likelihood of false positive testing and enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Selected additional testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Linzer M, Yang EH, Estes NA 3rd, et al.
