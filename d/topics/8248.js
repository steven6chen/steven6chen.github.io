Most fiber passes through your body without being digested. But it can affect how you digest other foods, and it can also improve your bowel movements.</p><p>There are 2 kinds of fiber. One kind is called &quot;soluble fiber&quot; and is found in fruits, oats, barley, beans, and peas. The other kind is called &quot;insoluble fiber,&quot; and is found in wheat, rye, and other grains.</p><p>Both kinds of fiber that you eat are called &quot;dietary fiber.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27979006\"><span class=\"h1\">Why is fiber important to my health?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fiber can help make your bowel movements softer and more regular. Adding fiber to your diet can help with problems including constipation, hemorrhoids, and diarrhea. Plus, it can help prevent &quot;accidents&quot; if you have trouble controlling your bowel movements.</p><p>Getting enough fiber can also help lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. That's because fiber can help lower cholesterol and help control blood sugar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27979013\"><span class=\"h1\">How much fiber do I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended amount of fiber is 20 to 35 grams a day. The nutrition label on packaged foods can show you how much fiber you are getting in each serving (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51585 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27979020\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I make sure I'm getting enough fiber?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To make sure that you're getting enough fiber, eat plenty of the fruits, vegetables, and grains that contain fiber (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79063\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79063 \">figure 2</a>). Many breakfast cereals also have a lot of fiber.</p><p>If you can't get enough fiber from food, you can add wheat bran to the foods you do eat. Or you can get fiber supplements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79264\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79264 \">table 2</a>). These often come in a powder and should be added to water or another liquid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27979027\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of fiber?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When you start eating more fiber, your belly might feel bloated, or you might have gas or cramps. You can avoid these side effects by adding fiber to your diet slowly.</p><p>Some people feel worse when they eat more fiber or take fiber supplements. If you feel worse after adding more fiber to your diet, you can try decreasing the amount of fiber to see if that helps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27979076\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diet and health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fecal incontinence (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diet and health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fecal incontinence (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-mellitus-and-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes mellitus and diet (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
