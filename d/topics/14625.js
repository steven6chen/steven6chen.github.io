They are also placed in clinically stable patients (eg, in a coronary catheterization unit), most often for the diagnosis and management of some patients with suspected or known pulmonary hypertension or for unexplained dyspnea.</p><p>The insertion of PACs is reviewed here. The indications, contraindications, complications, and interpretation of PAC measurements are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-techniques-normal-hemodynamics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac catheterization techniques: Normal hemodynamics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major hemodynamic indices measured on pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) are pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery occlusion (ie, wedge) pressure, right atrial and right ventricular pressure, cardiac output and cardiac index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;, section on 'Physiologic measurements'</a>.)</p><p>Although the routine use of PACs in critically ill patients has fallen out of favor, hemodynamic measurements obtained by PAC can be helpful in those with unexplained shock or those with unknown volume status despite active fluid resuscitation, as well as in patients with severe cardiogenic shock (eg, acute valvular disease) or those with suspected or known pulmonary artery hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68139\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68139 \">table 1</a>). PACs can also be used to guide fluid resuscitation, titrate vasopressors, assess the hemodynamic effects of changes in mechanical ventilator settings, or assess response to medications (eg, pulmonary hypertension-specific medication). PACs are occasionally inserted preoperatively for high risk cardiopulmonary surgery and in rare cases are inserted for the investigation of unexplained dyspnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea#H809968769\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;, section on 'Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with pulmonary artery catheterization'</a>.)</p><p>Absolute contraindications include infection at the insertion site, right ventricular assist device, and insertion during cardiopulmonary bypass, as well as lack of consent. Relative contraindications to the placement of a PAC include those with a coagulopathy (international normalized ratio &gt;1.5), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL),</span> electrolyte disturbances (hypo- or hyper-kalemia, -magnesemia, -natremia, -calcemia), and severe acid-base disturbances (eg, pH &lt;7.2 or &gt;7.5). &#160;</p><p>Detailed discussion of the indications, contraindications, and complications of PAC insertion are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a decision is made to insert a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), a site should be selected, the appropriate personnel recruited, and all necessary equipment should be placed in the patient&rsquo;s room. When feasible, we prefer that the PAC be placed in the right jugular vein under ultrasound guidance. Consent should be in place and laboratory studies should ensure that no severe coagulopathy, electrolyte, or acid-base disturbances exist to increase the risk of hemorrhage or arrhythmias. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372487314\"><span class=\"h2\">Selecting the site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The site of insertion should be selected in advance so that the appropriate equipment can be in place (eg, fluoroscopy and a longer catheter is required for femoral or antecubital vein approaches). </p><p>Options include insertion into the internal jugular, subclavian, femoral, or antecubital (basilic or brachial) vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In our experience we prefer to use the right internal jugular vein or as an alternative, the left subclavian vein; these approaches facilitate passage of the catheter into the pulmonary artery. The femoral and antecubital veins are generally avoided but can be used when no other access is available (eg, hematoma or altered neck and chest anatomy from prior radiation). For cardiac surgery, the right followed by left internal jugular vein is often the first choice approaches because after sternotomy and sternal retraction, a PAC inserted by the subclavian route may be compressed and kinked under the clavicle, making it impossible to withdraw or advance the catheter, should this be required during the course of surgery. The advantages and disadvantages of each location are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56392 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of jugular venous catheters&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of subclavian venous catheters&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of femoral venous catheters&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>When feasible, we advise that the target vessel be visualized by using a hand-held ultrasound device to determine the optimal insertion site by allowing the clinician to see the size, configuration, and position of the blood vessels. </p><p>In some patients, a central venous catheter (CVC) that is already in place can be exchanged for PAC provided sufficient access is in place elsewhere during PAC insertion for the infusion of critical life-sustaining and life-saving medications. In such circumstances, ensuring that a sterile wire of sufficient length is used to exchange the CVC for the PAC introducer is important. </p><p>Should a pacemaker be in place (usually in the left subclavian vein), a site on the opposing side is preferred to minimize pacemaker dislodgement and infection during insertion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372487182\"><span class=\"h2\">Personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the decision has been made to insert a PAC, an adequate number of personnel need to be recruited. This includes a clinician experienced in the insertion of PACs to insert the catheter and nursing personnel to monitor and care for the patient. A fluoroscopist may be required for PACs that require fluoroscopy for insertion. </p><p>Additional clinicians may be necessary in the intensive care unit to care for unattended patients as PAC insertion can be time-consuming. As an example in a study of 120 insertions, the median duration from the decision to insert a PAC to the initiation of catheter-based treatment was approximately two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following items should be gathered and placed in the patient's room prior to insertion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The introducer and PAC with attendant equipment and cables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F100244\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100244 \">picture 1</a>). All equipment needed for catheter insertion, pressure monitoring, sedation, and sterilization is listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54646 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ultrasound device, transducer gel, and sterile probe sheath, if ultrasound-guided insertion is planned. Ultrasonography is suggested for the safe insertion of the introducer needle when placing PACs. They can also be used to check for suspected pneumothorax during or post insertion.

Arrhythmias and vascular complications can occur during insertion, which may require emergent resuscitation. As an example an external pacing device may be necessary should complete heart block develop, or paddles (or hands-free electrode patches) may be needed should persistent ventricular tachycardia develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telemetry equipment. Telemetry with the ability to monitor pressure tracings and concurrent electrocardiography tracings during placement is necessary for the safe insertion of PACs. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Advancing the catheter'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoroscopic equipment, if fluoroscopic-guided insertion is planned. Fluoroscopy may be performed in patients who have marked right atrial enlargement, right ventricular dilatation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, or a left bundle branch block. It is also generally needed for patients who have PACs placed in the femoral vein or for those with unusual anatomy (eg, persistent left superior vena cava). Portable fluoroscopic equipment may not be available at some institutions, in which case insertion in either a cardiac catheterization laboratory or radiology department may be an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Advancing the catheter'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INSERTION OF THE INTRODUCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following site selection, the patient should be positioned in Trendelenburg (jugular or subclavian approach) or supine (femoral or antecubital approach). Local anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravenous sedation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) is administered and the introducer is placed under sterile conditions using the modified Seldinger technique. Confirmation of venous placement and a chest radiograph (jugular or subclavian approach) should be performed after introducer insertion and before the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is placed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372488221\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be in Trendelenburg for the jugular and subclavian approaches and supine for the femoral and antecubital approaches. The clinician should be able to observe and palpate the relevant anatomical landmarks for the selected site. The bed should be placed at a height that is comfortable for the clinician throughout the procedure. Additional details regarding positioning for each approach are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H1232389424\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters#H105076091\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of jugular venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters#H58338655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of subclavian venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters#H58340216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of femoral venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372487411\"><span class=\"h2\">Sterilizing the field</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For internal jugular and subclavian venous access, a wide skin preparation that includes the neck and chest above the nipple line should be performed. If difficult access is anticipated, the neck and chest can be prepared bilaterally so that an alternative site can be chosen, should the initial plan fail. For femoral venous access, a wide skin preparation encompasses the anterior and medial surfaces of the proximal thigh and extends superior to the inguinal ligament. </p><p>For all selected sites, a wide procedural field should be prepared with strict adherence to aseptic technique. This includes hand washing with antiseptic-containing soap or alcohol-based gels or foams, full barrier precautions (sterile gloves, long-sleeved surgical gown, a surgical mask, a surgical cap, a large sterile sheet drape), skin disinfection with 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, and avoidance of the femoral insertion site, if feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A more detailed discussion of site preparation is provided separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

For subclavian approaches, the periosteum of the clavicle should be anesthetized. </p><p>For patients who are awake and anxious, low dose of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> to a maximum of 2 mg) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> to a maximum of 200 mcg) may facilitate the procedure (eg, outpatients with suspected pulmonary hypertension). For those on mechanical ventilation, increasing sedative infusions or administering a bolus of alternate sedative is appropriate. Selection of agents for procedural sedation should be individualized, the details of which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372487586\"><span class=\"h2\">Insertion of the introducer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An introducer is a wide bore (8.5 F), short, central venous catheter through which the PAC is placed (eg, cordis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F100244\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100244 \">picture 1</a>). The proximal end contains a hemostatic valve (external to the skin), through which the PAC is eventually introduced to the target vein. It also has a side-arm extension that allows continuous central venous access for fluid and drug administration. Insertion of the introducer is similar to that of central venous catheters. It is generally accomplished using the modified Seldinger technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74780\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74780 \">figure 1</a>) and once in place, the catheter is secured with sutures. Details regarding the insertion of central venous <span class=\"nowrap\">catheters/introducers</span> are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3103752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Central catheters and devices'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters#H437918651\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of jugular venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Internal jugular vein cannulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters#H58349363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of subclavian venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Subclavian vein cannulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters#H58340713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of femoral venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Femoral vein cannulation'</a>.)</p><p>Arterial puncture during introducer needle insertion is not unusual. The risk is reduced, but not eliminated, using ultrasound. Arterial puncture with the introducer needle is typically managed by withdrawing the needle and placing pressure on the artery for 10 to 15 minutes. However, arterial dilation and cannula placement (ie, arterial cannulation) with the introducer catheter itself is considered a more life-threatening complication, in which case, the catheter should be left in place and <strong>not</strong> removed; a vascular surgeon should be consulted for management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention&quot;, section on 'Vascular injury'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3105206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Confirmation of cordis or introducer placement inside the target should occur <strong>before</strong> the PAC is placed. Options include visualization of dark blood lacking a pulsatile flow, transduction of a pressure waveform from the catheter, and blood gas analysis, none of which is fool-proof. However, when in doubt we prefer pressure transduction as the more accurate method for confirmation of venous placement. For jugular and subclavian approaches, a chest radiograph to confirm that no pneumothorax has occurred during insertion is advisable. Details regarding confirmation of catheter placement are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H1232392311\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Confirmation of catheter tip positioning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters#H1232391295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of jugular venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Confirmation of jugular catheter position'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters#H662982527\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of subclavian venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Confirmation of subclavian catheter position'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters#H662983898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of femoral venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Confirmation of femoral catheter position'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INSERTION OF THE PULMONARY ARTERY CATHETER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the introducer has been inserted into the target blood vessel, the field should be re-sterilized. The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) ports should be flushed; the integrity of the balloon and the ability of the PAC to transduce pressure should also be checked. With the patient in the supine position, the PAC is advanced through the introducer, and then through the superior vena cava (SVC), cardiac chambers, and pulmonary artery (PA) while the pressure at its tip is transduced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601 \">figure 2</a>). As a general rule, during advancement the balloon may only be inflated once the pressure tracing indicates that the tip of the catheter is in the SVC or right atrium (RA). Additionally, the balloon should only be inflated whenever the catheter is advanced, and deflated whenever the catheter is withdrawn. Distinct changes in the pressure waveforms indicate transition through each cardiac chamber as well as a final pulmonary artery wedge position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372488686\"><span class=\"h2\">Re-sterilizing the field</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the introducer placement is confirmed, a new sterile field should be prepared. A wide procedural field from the head of the bed to mid-thigh is appropriate using a similar aseptic technique to that described for the insertion of the introducer. (See <a href=\"#H372487411\" class=\"local\">'Sterilizing the field'</a> above.) In addition to the skin of the surrounding field, the introducer hub should also be disinfected with 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> prior to PAC insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

It can be used for infusions and occasionally for pacing the RV.</p><p/><p>All ports should be should capped and flushed with sterile saline (except the thermistor port which does not need a cap and cannot be flushed). The balloon should be inflated to test for leaks. It should inflate symmetrically without obstructing the opening of the distal lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59475 \">figure 3</a>). The syringe provided with the package is used to fill the balloon with air, which is limited to only 1.5 mL in order to prevent overinflation. </p><p>A protective sleeve (provided with the package) that connects to the introducer is typically placed if the PAC is to be left in place for a prolonged period of time. The PAC should be placed through the sleeve ensuring that the sleeve connector is facing the distal end of the catheter and that the balloon is not damaged in the process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F100243\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100243 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p>The pressure lines and transducers should be connected to the distal and proximal pressure monitoring ports, calibrated, zero-balanced, and transducer function checked (see below). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124617941\"><span class=\"h3\">Zeroing and referencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PAC must be appropriately zeroed and referenced to obtain accurate readings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The system can be referenced by placing the air-fluid interface of either the in-line stopcock or the stopcock on top of the transducer at the &ldquo;phlebostatic level&rdquo; (ie, reference point zero) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69197\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69197 \">figure 4</a>). This point is usually the intersection of a frontal plane passing midway between the anterior and posterior surface of the chest and a transverse plane lying at the junction of the 4th intercostal space and the sternal margin. It is important to note that this &quot;phlebostatic level&quot; changes with differences in the position of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77194 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124618632\"><span class=\"h3\">Checking transducer function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure transducer function can be confirmed by waving the distal catheter tip gently, which should result in a sinusoidal waveform on the monitor. The operator must have an unobstructed view of the hemodynamic monitor during the entire procedure because the pressure tracing monitors the location of the catheter tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601 \">figure 2</a>). Although operator-dependent, we prefer to use a 0 to 60 mmHg calibration on the monitor screen to fully appreciate the change in pressure tracings during catheter advancement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults&quot;, section on 'Catheter waveforms and pressures'</a>.)</p><p>A simple maneuver is performed by some experts to check for proper assembly and function of the PAC and monitoring system. When the tip of the PAC is held near heart level, the recorded pressure should be 0 mmHg, confirming that the transducer was correctly adjusted to the level of the heart at the beginning of the procedure. The catheter tip is then raised up straight to create a 30 cm tall vertical column, which should produce a recorded pressure of 22 mmHg (equivalent to 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) on the bedside monitor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372487762\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be placed in the supine position regardless of the approach. Occasionally, when catheter advancement is difficult, the patient can be repositioned to encourage appropriate device floatation.

The balloon at the distal tip of the catheter is inflated and the catheter is advanced until the pulmonary artery wedge pressure waveform is identified. The balloon is then deflated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoroscopic guidance is less commonly performed. The catheter is visualized by fluoroscopy as it is advanced and balloon inflation is not necessary until the catheter reaches the pulmonary artery. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448352584\"><span class=\"h3\">General rules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following rules should be kept in mind during PAC advancement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Catheter curve</strong> &ndash; The catheter has a natural curve. Thus, prior to insertion, it should be oriented so that its curve facilitates passage through the cardiac chambers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54333\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54333 \">figure 6</a>). The pulmonary artery (PA) is caudal and anteromedial to the right ventricle (RV). Thus, it is preferable that when the tip enters the RV, it is naturally pointing in this direction. As an example, when the operator is caudal, the natural curvature should be counterclockwise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F100243\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100243 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Catheter distance</strong> &ndash; The catheter has graduations with distance in centimeters from the tip clearly indicated on it. We find it useful to verbally state the distance at the bedside during advancement. While advancing the catheter, it is useful to keep in mind the &quot;rule of 10s,&quot; where anatomic and hemodynamic changes occur at approximately 10 cm intervals. As an example, when the insertion site is an internal jugular or subclavian vein, the RA is generally entered after inserting the catheter 20 cm, the RV after inserting 30 cm, the PA after inserting 40 cm, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) after inserting 50 cm. Estimated distances from the various insertion sites to the RA, RV, and PA are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56392 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-techniques-normal-hemodynamics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac catheterization techniques: Normal hemodynamics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Balloon inflation and deflation</strong> &ndash; The balloon should only be inflated <strong>after</strong> the SVC or RA has been reached. (See <a href=\"#H448352590\" class=\"local\">'Advancement through cardiac chambers'</a> below.) The balloon should be fully <strong>inflated </strong>whenever the catheter is advanced to aid &ldquo;floatation&rdquo; and minimize myocardial or vessel rupture; in contrast, it should be completely <strong>deflated </strong>whenever the catheter is withdrawn to minimize valvular rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59475 \">figure 3</a>). The balloon should be fully inflated to a maximum volume of 1.5 mL during advancement. Inflation is normally met with a small amount of resistance. Excessive resistance usually indicates malposition of the catheter tip, which should prompt immediate deflation, withdrawing, and repositioning before another attempt is made to inflate the balloon. Little resistance suggests rupture of the balloon, in which case the balloon should be deflated, the catheter removed and the integrity of the balloon rechecked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clear instructions</strong> &ndash; Catheter advancement should always involve clear verbal bedside instructions such as &ldquo;balloon up,&rdquo; &ldquo;balloon down,&rdquo; or calling out the location of the catheter (eg, &ldquo;catheter at 10 cm&rdquo;) to minimize the risk of complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448352590\"><span class=\"h3\">Advancement through cardiac chambers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appearance of expected hemodynamic waveforms during PAC insertion for a pressure waveform guidance approach is described in this section.

The balloon should <strong>not</strong> be inflated inside the introducer. The balloon may be inflated once the pressure tracing indicates that the tip of the catheter is in the SVC or RA (eg, when using the internal jugular approach, the operator should expect to see a central venous <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/RA</span> tracing at 20 cm, or approximately 5 cm beyond the tip of the introducer sheath) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74628\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74628 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58343 \">figure 7</a>). The normal mean RA pressure is between 0 and 7 mmHg. Balloon inflation or deflation does not change the waveform or recorded pressure until the wedge position in the pulmonary artery is achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H462362391\"><span class=\"h4\">Transitioning from the SVC or RA to the RV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the balloon is inflated in the SVC or RA, the catheter is advanced <strong>slowly</strong>. When the catheter tip is advanced across the tricuspid valve (from the RA to the RV), the pressure waveform changes and the systolic pressure increases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74628\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74628 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72775\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72775 \">figure 8</a>). The normal right ventricular diastolic pressure is 3 to 12 mmHg and the peak systolic pressure is 15 to 25 mmHg.</p><p>If a RV waveform is not observed after inserting the catheter 40 cm (ie, from an internal jugular or subclavian vein approach), coiling in the RA is likely. In this situation, the balloon should be deflated, the catheter withdrawn to 20 cm, following which advancement should be repeated with the balloon inflated. </p><p>Occasionally, difficulties occur as a consequence of congenital or acquired anatomical anomalies (eg, persistence of the left SVC, absent right SVC, prior radiation). </p><p>Rarely, does the PAC enter the left atrium (LA) through a coronary sinus&ndash;left atrial communication. LA waveforms can be recognized by their higher amplitude when compared with RA waveforms as well as by their similar appearance to pulmonary capillary wedge waveforms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53685\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53685 \">waveform 2</a>); the level of oxyhemoglobin saturation will also be higher in the LA when compared with the RA. </p><p>In many cases, because the balloon tends to float to nondependent regions, positioning the patient head down may aid flotation past the tricuspid valve. Alternatively, fluoroscopy may be required for future attempts at PAC placement especially is tricuspid stenosis is suspected. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H462362409\"><span class=\"h4\">Transitioning from the RV to the PA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of arrhythmia is greatest while the catheter tip is in the RV. Thus, the catheter should be advanced from the RV to the PA without delay. When the catheter tip passes across the pulmonic valve (from the RV to the PA), the diastolic pressure increases and a characteristic dicrotic notch appears in the waveform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601 \">figure 2</a>). The normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 15 to 25 mmHg and the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure is 4 to 15 mmHg.</p><p>If more than 30 cm to 40 cm of the catheter has been inserted (assuming that the insertion site is an internal jugular or subclavian vein) and the pressure tracing still indicates that the tip is within the RV, then the catheter is probably coiling in the RV, or the RV is enlarged. In this situation, the balloon should be deflated and then the catheter should be withdrawn until the RA waveform appears usually at 20 cm. Then, the balloon can be reinflated and another attempt can be made to advance the catheter through the RV and into the PA. </p><p>If persistent coiling is suspected or difficulties in transitioning into the PA occurs (eg, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation), then the balloon should be deflated and the catheter should be withdrawn until the RA waveform reappears; the patient can be repositioned in the left lateral position with the head tilted slightly upward to encourage floatation into the PA. On occasion, a catheter may be floated to the proper position by injecting 10 to 20 mL of the iced solution prepared for cardiac output measurement or cold saline through the distal lumen (&ldquo;stiffens&rdquo; the tip). In a patient with low cardiac output, deep inspiration during spontaneous ventilation will increase venous return and right ventricular output transiently which may also facilitate catheter flotation into the PA. Some clinicians fill the balloon with 1.5 mL of sterile saline. However, this maneuver is risky because saline, unlike air, is noncompressible, a feature that may increase the risk of pulmonary artery rupture. </p><p>Owing to gravitational and anatomic factors, most catheters float to the right PA. Thus, to catheterize the left PA selectively, the patient should be positioned with the right side down. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H462362424\"><span class=\"h4\">Identifying the pulmonary occlusion pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the catheter tip has reached the PA, it should be advanced until the pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure (PCOP) is identified by a decrease in the pressure combined with a change in the waveform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601 \">figure 2</a>). The balloon should then be deflated and the PA tracing should reappear. </p><p>If the PCOP tracing persists or there is any uncertainty about whether the tracing is a PCOP or PA tracing, then the catheter should be withdrawn (with the balloon deflated) until a definitive PA tracing is identified. Occasionally, the uncertainty persists despite withdrawing the catheter. In this situation, simultaneous pressure and electrocardiographic tracings may be helpful. The peak systolic pressure in the PA occurs just prior to the electrocardiographic T wave, whereas the peak V wave of a PCOP tracing occurs after the electrocardiographic T wave. The normal mean PCOP (which is reflective of left atrial pressure) is between 4 and 12 mmHg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP)'</a>.)</p><p>Once the operator has confirmed that the catheter tip is in the PA and a PCOP can be obtained, an accurate final wedge position should be confirmed and recorded (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h4\">Final wedge position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final position of the catheter within the PA must be such that a PCOP tracing is obtained whenever 75 to 100 percent of the 1.5 mL maximum volume of the balloon is insufflated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59475 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If less than 1 mL is required to obtain a PCOP tracing, the tip of the catheter is probably in the distal PA (ie, &ldquo;over wedged&rdquo;) and further inflation may lead to vessel rupture. In this situation, the catheter should be withdrawn 0.1 to 0.5 cm with the balloon deflated, and then the balloon is reinflated with 1 to 1.5 mL of air to check the position. If it remains over wedged, then this process should be repeated until the optimal position is found.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If maximal balloon inflation fails to result in a PCOP tracing, or does so only after a 2 to 3 second delay, the catheter is probably too proximal. This means that it could slip back into the RV, increasing the risk of arrhythmia and intracardiac damage. In this situation, the catheter should be advanced with balloon inflated in small increments (0.1 to 0.5cm) until the optimal position is located. The length of the catheter that was passed (indicated by marks on the catheter at 10 cm intervals) should be documented in the patient's medical record.</p><p/><p>Once the desired position is reached, if a protective sleeve is to be used it should be attached to the hub of the introducer, and a secure antiseptic dressing should be applied. If a protective sleeve is not in place, the catheter can be taped to the skin with a sterile dressing. </p><p>The PCOP is best measured with the patient in the supine position, at the end of expiration. End expiration is identified as a positive deflection in the PAC waveform in a spontaneously breathing patient and a negative deflection in the PAC waveform during positive pressure ventilation. However, at end-expiration, all intrathoracic pressures are equal to atmospheric pressure which allows the PCOP to be accurately measured regardless of whether the patient is spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated. Accurate measurement of the PCOP and sources of error including the effects of respiration are discussed separately.
