It happens when a part of the knee joint called the &quot;meniscus&quot; tears. The meniscus is the cushion of rubbery material (cartilage) between the thigh bone and shin bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77293\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77293 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are different kinds of meniscal tears, depending on the part of the cartilage that tears and how it tears.</p><p>A meniscal tear can happen suddenly, such as during a sports injury. It can also happen slowly over time. This is more common in older adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271145954\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a meniscal tear?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a meniscal tear can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee swelling (from a collection of fluid around the knee)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The knee locking, not straightening all the way, or feeling like it &quot;catches&quot; on something as it straightens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The knee giving out, feeling unstable, or feeling like it won't support you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee stiffness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271145969\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a meniscal tear?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam to check how your knee and leg move.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse might order an X-ray of your knee. He or she might also order an imaging test such as an MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>If your doctor is still unsure whether you have a meniscal tear, he or she might recommend surgery called &quot;arthroscopy.&quot; This lets the doctor look inside your knee at the meniscus. During arthroscopy, the doctor makes a few small cuts around the knee. Then he or she inserts long, thin tools into the knee joint. One tool has a camera on the end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63687 \">figure 2</a>). It sends pictures to a TV screen that the doctor sees. If you have a meniscal tear, the doctor can use the tools to treat it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271146001\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a meniscal tear treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on how small or large the tear is, how long you have had the tear, your symptoms, and your individual situation.</p><p>Treatment for a meniscal tear usually involves:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting your knee &ndash; Avoid movements that worsen the pain. Try not to squat, kneel, or run.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raising your knee above the level of your heart, for example, by propping it up on pillows &ndash; This is helpful only for the first few days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on your knee &ndash; Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the knee every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after the injury. Some people find it helpful to ice up to 2 days after the injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using crutches to walk, if you have severe pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing a knee brace, if your knee feels unstable</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking a pain-relieving medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knee &ndash; After your pain improves, your doctor or nurse will show you exercises to do. He or she might also have you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In many cases, symptoms improve with this treatment. But if you have a large tear, or your symptoms don't improve, your doctor might recommend surgery. During surgery, the doctor will treat the tear. This might involve removing part or all of your meniscus. Surgery is usually not helpful for people who are middle-aged or older and whose meniscus has worn down over time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271146016\"><span class=\"h1\">How long does a meniscal tear take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meniscal tear can take weeks to heal, depending on the type of tear.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271146032\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain, or your pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever with knee pain, swelling, and redness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have numbness or tingling in the lower leg, foot, or toes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your knee locks and you can't get it unlocked.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271146047\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a meniscal tear have a higher chance of getting a condition called osteoarthritis later on. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, which is the general term for inflammation of the joints. Osteoarthritis can cause joint pain, stiffness, and swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271146062\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Knee pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minimally-invasive-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Minimally invasive surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=questions-to-ask-if-you-are-having-surgery-or-a-procedure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Questions to ask if you are having surgery or a procedure (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Knee pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
