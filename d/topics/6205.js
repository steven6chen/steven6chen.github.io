Obstruction can be functional (due to abnormal intestinal physiology) or due to a mechanical obstruction, which can be acute or chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Advanced small bowel obstruction leads to bowel dilation and retention of fluid within the lumen proximal to the obstruction, while distal to the obstruction, as luminal contents pass, the bowel decompresses. If bowel dilation is excessive, or strangulation occurs, perfusion to the intestine can be compromised, leading to necrosis or perforation, complications that increase the mortality associated with small bowel obstruction. </p><p>The most common causes of mechanical small bowel obstruction are postoperative adhesions and hernias. Other etiologies of small bowel obstruction include disease intrinsic to the wall of the small intestine (eg, tumors, stricture, intramural hematoma) and processes that cause intraluminal obstruction (eg, intussusception, gallstones, foreign bodies). </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and etiology of small bowel obstruction will be reviewed here.</p><p>The treatment of small bowel obstruction is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care of bowel obstruction in cancer patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of colorectal obstruction is reviewed elsewhere.

The cause of the obstruction may be external to the bowel (extrinsic), within the wall of the bowel (intrinsic), or due to a luminal defect that prevents the passage of gastrointestinal contents. Obstruction of the small intestine can be partial or complete. A type of complete obstruction, a closed-loop obstruction, occurs when the intestine is obstructed at two locations, creating a segment with no proximal or distal outlet. Closed-loop obstruction can rapidly progress to bowel strangulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perforation. (See <a href=\"#H104559350\" class=\"local\">'Complete obstruction and closed-loop obstruction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H413452961\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main function of the small intestine is to digest and absorb nutrients. Microvilli and circular folds (ie, valvulae conniventes, plicae circulares, or valves of Kerckring) increase the surface area available for absorption and cause the intestinal contents to twist while flowing through the small intestine. These circular folds can be seen in radiographic studies. The small bowel is relatively free of microbes, whereas the large intestine is populated with commensal bacteria that aid digestion, synthesize a number of vitamins, and break down bilirubin. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H413452987\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructive physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstruction leads to progressive dilation of the intestine proximal to the blockage, while distal to the blockage the bowel will decompress as luminal contents pass. Swallowed air and gas from bacterial fermentation can accumulate, adding to bowel distention. As the process continues, the bowel wall becomes edematous, normal absorptive function is lost, and fluid is sequestered into the bowel lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There may also be transudative loss of fluid from the intestinal lumen into the peritoneal cavity. With proximal bowel obstruction, ongoing emesis leads to additional loss of fluid containing Na, K, H, and Cl, and metabolic alkalosis. These fluid losses can result in hypovolemia. Bacterial overgrowth can also occur in the proximal small bowel, which is normally nearly sterile, and emesis can become feculent. </p><p>If bowel dilation is excessive, the intramural vessels of the small intestine become compromised and perfusion to the wall of the intestine is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If perfusion to a segment of intestine is inadequate to meet the metabolic needs of the tissue, ischemia will occur, which will eventually lead to necrosis and perforation unless the process is interrupted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Alternatively, ischemic necrosis of the bowel can be related to twisting of the bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its mesentery around an adhesive band or to lax intestinal attachments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31873532\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute mechanical small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. It is estimated that over 300,000 laparotomies per year are performed in the United States for adhesion-related obstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Ischemia, which complicates 7 to 42 percent of bowel obstructions, significantly increases mortality associated with bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The small bowel is involved in approximately 80 percent of cases of mechanical intestinal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The incidence is similar for males and females. In one study of adult patients, the average age of patients with acute obstruction was 64 years, women comprised 60 percent of the group, and the small bowel was affected in 76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1638313\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that increase the risk for the most common etiologies of small bowel obstruction are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53183\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53183 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H939841602\" class=\"local\">'Specific etiologies'</a> below.)</p><p>The most important risk factors include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior abdominal or pelvic surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal wall or groin hernia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal inflammation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of or increased risk for neoplasm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior irradiation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of foreign body ingestion</p><p/><p>The most important risk factor for mechanical small bowel obstruction in the United States is prior abdominal surgery causing postoperative adhesions. In a systematic review, the incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction due to any cause was 9.4 percent; the incidence related to adhesive disease was 2.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with a history of prior abdominal or pelvic surgery, and particularly colorectal surgery, appendectomy, gynecologic surgery, prior adhesiolysis, and resection of malignancy, are prone to adhesive small bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/4,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-13</a>]. The risk of early postoperative bowel obstruction due to adhesions, which is defined as bowel obstruction occurring during the same hospitalization as the index operation, is increased after exploration for trauma. The incidence was reported at 3.9 percent in a review of 571 patients, a rate that was increased fourfold in the presence of traumatic gastrointestinal perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic gastrointestinal injury in the adult patient&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For patients with a history of prior bowel obstruction, whether managed medically or surgically, the likelihood of recurrent obstruction increases with increasing number of episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>]. Postoperative adhesions may also be responsible for chronic abdominal pain. In a systematic review, five studies evaluated the incidence of chronic abdominal pain following surgery. Chronic abdominal pain was attributable to postoperative adhesions in 34 to 67 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In women, chronic pelvic pain and infertility can also result from adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-female-infertility#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Fallopian tube abnormalities/pelvic adhesions'</a>.)</p><p>Adhesive small bowel obstruction occurs in the absence of prior abdominal surgery in 3 to 9 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The underlying etiology is malignant in only approximately 10 percent and is equivalent to the prevalence in patients with previous surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In one study of 34 patients without prior history of abdominal surgery who underwent exploratory surgery for small bowel obstruction, 29 (85 percent) had adhesions as the cause of the obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Adhesions may have developed in these patients as a result of prior episodes of intra-abdominal inflammation (eg, diverticulitis, Crohn disease). Alternatively, other pathologies, such as hernia or volvulus, can lead to small bowel obstruction by causing extrinsic compression of the small bowel. In one study of 103 patients over a five-year period, nonoperative treatment was successful in 61 percent, with a recurrence rate of &lt;10 percent over a mean 4.5-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Diseases intrinsic to the wall of the small intestine (eg, tumor, stricture, intramural hematoma) can cause small bowel obstruction by encroaching upon the lumen of the bowel because of edema, infiltration of the bowel wall, or from progressive stricture formation. </p><p>Processes that block an otherwise normal bowel lumen (eg, intussusception, gallstones, foreign body) can also cause mechanical bowel obstruction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H413451751\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bowel obstruction can present with an abrupt onset of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention, or with intermittent, acute symptoms that resolve only to recur again. Some patients with chronic, partial obstruction may develop superimposed symptoms and signs of acute bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/1,6,16,20-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,16,20-31</a>]. </p><p>The history should seek to identify risk factors for bowel obstruction, which will provide clues to the potential etiology of suspected bowel obstruction or suggest an alternative diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In addition, prescription or nonprescription medications (including recreational drugs) that may impact bowel function should be noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62307 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1638313\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H939841602\" class=\"local\">'Specific etiologies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H939846527\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1639196\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute small bowel obstruction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87987265\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms most commonly associated with acute small bowel obstruction are nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, and obstipation (ie, inability to pass flatus or stool).</p><p>The frequency of these symptoms is variable and depends upon the etiology and location of obstruction (proximal versus distal), and degree of obstruction (partial versus complete). One review of 300 patients<em> </em>reported abdominal pain in 92 percent of patients and vomiting in 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a prospective study of 150 patients, the absence of the passage of flatus (90 percent) or stool (81 percent) was the most common presenting symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study of patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction, the presenting symptoms were cramping abdominal pain in 68 percent, vomiting in 77 percent, absence of passage of flatus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feces in 52 percent, and constant pain in 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Abdominal pain associated with small bowel obstruction is frequently described as periumbilical and cramping with paroxysms of pain occurring every four or five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A progression from cramping to more focal and constant pain may indicate peritoneal irritation related to complications (ischemia, bowel necrosis). A sudden onset of severe pain may suggest acute intestinal perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With proximal small bowel obstruction (duodenum, proximal jejunum), nausea and vomiting can be relatively severe, and patients with proximal small bowel obstruction typically cease taking in food or liquids orally. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H413452336\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should evaluate the patient overall for systemic signs related to the bowel obstruction. A hallmark of small bowel obstruction is dehydration, which manifests as tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and reduced urine output, and, if severe, dry mucus membranes. Fever may be associated with infection (eg, abscess) or other complications of obstruction (ischemia, necrosis), and although fever suggests infection, its absence does not rule it out, particularly in older or immunocompromised patients. Hematochezia may be a sign of tumor, ischemia, or inflammatory mucosal injury, or intussusception. </p><p>Abdominal inspection will identify a variable degree of abdominal distention in most patients with acute bowel obstruction. Abdominal inspection should also look for any surgical scars and evidence for abdominal wall hernia (including incisional hernia) or groin hernias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In multiple retrospective reviews, abdominal distension was the most frequent physical finding on clinical examination, occurring in 56 to 65 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/5,21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21,26</a>]. Although nausea and vomiting may be less severe in patients with distal small bowel obstruction compared with proximal obstruction, abdominal distention is greater because the more proximal bowel acts as a reservoir. Swallowed air and gas from bacterial fermentation can also accumulate, adding to the abdominal distention. It is important to remember, however, that in patients with a closed-loop obstruction, abdominal distention can be minimal. (See <a href=\"#H13713325\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Acute mechanical bowel obstruction is characterized by high-pitched &quot;tinkling&quot; sounds associated with the pain. With significant bowel distention, bowel sounds may become muffled, and as the bowel progressively distends, bowel sounds can become hypoactive.</p><p>Distention of the bowel results in hyperresonance or tympany to percussion throughout the abdomen. However, fluid-filled loops will result in dullness. If percussion over the liver is tympanitic rather than dull, it may be indicative of free intra-abdominal air. Tenderness to light percussion suggests peritonitis. </p><p>Abdominal palpation may identify any abdominal wall or groin hernias, or abnormal masses, which, in the setting of small bowel obstruction, may indicate an abscess, volvulus, or tumor as the source of obstruction. Digital rectal examination should be performed to identify fecal impaction or rectal mass as the source of obstruction. Gross or occult blood may be related to intestinal tumor, ischemia, inflammatory mucosal injury, or intussusception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87987279\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical laboratory evaluation for patients who present with significant abdominal pain includes a complete blood count with differential and electrolytes including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Although routine laboratory studies are not specific for a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, these studies help assess the presence and severity of hypovolemia, leukocytosis, and metabolic abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypokalemia). Leukocytosis with leftward shift may indicate the presence of complications. Anemia may point to a specific etiology (eg, Crohn disease, tumor, Meckel's diverticulum). </p><p>In patients who present with systemic signs (eg, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status), additional laboratory investigation should include arterial blood gas (ABG), serum lactate, and blood cultures. Metabolic alkalosis can result from severe vomiting, but metabolic (lactic) acidosis can also occur if the bowel becomes ischemic, or if hypovolemia is severe enough to cause hypoperfusion of other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although there is no reliable clinical or laboratory marker for ischemia, elevated serum lactate is sensitive, but not specific, for ischemia in patients with small bowel obstruction (sensitivity 90 to 100 percent, specificity 42 to 87 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454344028\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic, partial obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic small bowel obstruction occurs in a fixed segment of bowel, and the obstruction is, by definition, partial. The most common causes of chronic, partial small bowel obstruction are chronic stricture from Crohn disease, adhesions from prior surgery, slowly growing tumors, and stricture related to prior bowel resection or irradiation. </p><p>Patients usually present with chronic postprandial abdominal discomfort and variable nausea. Abdominal distention and tympany may be present, but usually without any fluid or electrolyte derangements. When a patient with chronic, partial small bowel obstruction becomes completely obstructed, the clinical presentation becomes indistinguishable from acute obstruction as described above. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H413451541\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient who presents with recurrent, intermittent obstruction, typically due to adhesions, is distinguished from the patient with a chronic, partial small bowel obstruction. Recurrent obstruction due to adhesions can occur in a fixed segment of bowel or differing segments of bowel. Those that occur at the same site due to a focal band adhesion are more likely to respond to surgery compared with those that occur at varying locations within the abdomen due to diffuse adhesions, for which surgery is likely to increase the risk of future obstructions. </p><p>During an episode of obstruction, symptoms are identical to those of patients with acute small bowel obstruction described above, but symptoms resolve and the patient may report postobstructive diarrhea. In the period between obstructive episodes, the patient is usually asymptomatic with a normal abdominal exam. </p><p>For patients with a history of prior bowel obstruction, whether managed medically or surgically, the likelihood of recurrent obstruction increases with an increasing number of episodes, and the asymptomatic time period between episodes decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After three prior episodes, the likelihood of recurrent obstruction is &gt;80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H939839435\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although mechanical small bowel obstruction may be suspected (or obvious) based upon risk factors, symptoms, and physical exam findings consistent with obstruction, abdominal imaging is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis, identify the location of obstruction, judge whether the obstruction is partial or complete, identify complications related to obstruction (ischemia, necrosis, perforation), and determine the potential etiology, all of which will help determine the urgency and nature of further treatment (conservative, endoscopy, surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

For most patients, we obtain plain radiographs to quickly confirm a diagnosis of bowel obstruction, and, provided the films do not have findings that indicate the need for immediate intervention, we use CT of the abdomen to further characterize the nature, severity, and potential etiologies of the obstruction. </p><p>Abdominal CT has largely replaced fluoroscopic studies for this purpose, but these and other studies, such as ultrasound, endoscopy, and magnetic resonance enterography, may be useful in certain patient populations.

Reconstruction in multiple planes allows the tortuous small bowel to be followed in the search for a transition point, which may be a sharply defined point, as with band adhesions, or a longer segment, as seen with matted adhesions or radiation enteritis.

However, for those who cannot tolerate oral contrast, retained intraluminal fluid within dilated bowel loops usually provides adequate enhancement when evaluating patients for ischemic complications. A lack of bowel wall enhancement, an early sign of ischemia, may be easier to identify in the absence of oral contrast agents.

Cessation of passage of stool or flatus indicates a complete obstruction, which is more likely to be associated with complications (ischemia, necrosis, perforation). However, it is important to remember that passage of flatus or feces can continue for 12 to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms as the more distal bowel decompresses. The absence of air or fluid in the distal small bowel or colon on plain abdominal radiographs or CT scan supports a diagnosis of complete obstruction. </p><p>A special type of complete obstruction, a closed-loop obstruction, may be more difficult to identify on radiologic studies. A closed-loop obstruction occurs when a segment of intestine, usually small bowel, is obstructed in two locations, creating a segment with no proximal or distal outlet. Only a short segment of intestine may be distended because of minimal abdominal distention. Closed-loop obstruction can rapidly lead to complications (ischemia, necrosis, perforation); thus, early identification and treatment are important to restore perfusion to the affected segment of bowel. In many cases, abdominal exploration will be needed to make a definitive diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>On imaging studies, a closed-loop obstruction often appears as a distended, fluid-filled, sometimes C-shaped or U-shaped bowel segment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53816\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53816 \">image 8</a>) with prominent mesenteric vessels converging on a point of torsion (CT whirl sign) or incarceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Consequently, the degree of opacification may not be sufficient to identify the transition point at the site of obstruction. The transition zone is, however, readily identified with enteroclysis. </p><p>Enteroclysis is a procedure in which the duodenum is intubated with a nasojejunal tube and a large volume of air and contrast (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>) is instilled directly into the small intestine while repeatedly imaging over time using fluoroscopy. The volume challenge caused by methylcellulose administration accentuates the effect of low-grade obstruction. For patients with chronic or recurrent small bowel obstruction, enteroclysis distends the small bowel sufficiently to identify areas of stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/38,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,78</a>]. However, enteroclysis is not appropriate for patients with acute obstruction. The prolonged transit time of contrast material through obstructed bowel means that follow-through radiographs require several hours to obtain, which can delay the diagnosis. In addition, patients with acute small bowel obstruction tolerate oral contrast material poorly, and it is preferable not to have large quantities of barium in the small bowel lumen if surgery is a possibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21268412\"><span class=\"h3\">Contrast enema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast enema can be helpful to diagnose small bowel obstruction in patients who have undergone proctocolectomy with an ileoanal J-pouch reconstruction (eg, ulcerative colitis) or patients with a subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (eg, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, cancer).

Although bowel obstruction is uncommon relative to all the possible causes of nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain, it is important to make the diagnosis expediently because of the potential for complications. For many medical conditions, vomiting is more likely to precede the onset of significant abdominal pain, whereas pain often precedes vomiting when associated with an acute surgical etiology.

It is exacerbated by electrolyte disorders, particularly hypokalemia. As the intestine becomes distended, the patient experiences many of the same symptoms as mechanical obstruction. However, on radiologic examination there is air in the colon and rectum, and on abdominal computed tomography (CT) or small bowel series there is no demonstrable mechanical obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. </p><p>In differentiating early postoperative ileus from postoperative adhesive disease, it is useful to note that nearly all patients with early postoperative bowel obstruction have an initial return of bowel function and oral intake, which is then followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and distention, whereas patients with adynamic ileus do not experience return of bowel function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

Tumor is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction, followed by adhesive disease and volvulus. Regardless of the etiology, large bowel obstruction presenting as a small bowel obstruction portends a higher mortality rate than that presenting as straightforward small bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p>Diseases affecting the proximal colon, such as cecal volvulus or adhesions, are more likely to be confused with acute small bowel obstruction compared with distal disease. In a study of patients with colonic volvulus, the most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (58 percent) and obstipation (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Tumors that cause colon obstruction commonly cause &quot;apple-core&quot; lesions, which are readily demonstrated on CT scan.

However, because adhesions commonly involve the omentum or mesenteric fat, signs that indicate abnormalities of the normal architecture may indicate that adhesions are responsible for bowel obstruction. Signs include a &quot;fat-bridging sign,&quot; which is a cord-like structure containing mesenteric fat that can bridge across the peritoneum; twisting of the mesentery (whirl signs); and tethering of the omentum.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13713325\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compromised blood flow to the intestinal tissue due to excessive bowel dilation or strangulation can lead to complications (ischemia, necrosis, perforation), which significantly increase mortality associated with bowel obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13713325\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of mechanical small bowel obstruction is postoperative adhesions from prior abdominal or pelvic surgery. Adhesions cause extrinsic compression of the bowel. Patients who have undergone appendectomy, gynecologic surgery, prior adhesiolysis, exploration for abdominal trauma, and prior resection for malignancy are particularly prone to adhesive small bowel obstruction. Adhesive small bowel obstruction can occur in the absence of prior surgery due to intestinal inflammation (Crohn disease, diverticular disease). Other etiologies that cause extrinsic compression of the intestine are hernia and volvulus. (See <a href=\"#H31873532\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171515090\" class=\"local\">'Adhesive bowel disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171515701\" class=\"local\">'Complicated hernia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171516139\" class=\"local\">'Volvulus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel obstruction can also be due to disease intrinsic to the wall of the intestine (eg, tumor, stricture, intramural hematoma) or processes that cause intraluminal obstruction (eg, intussusception, gallstones, foreign body). Patients who present with symptoms consistent with a small bowel obstruction but who do not have a history of prior abdominal surgery and have no other obvious risk factors (eg, hernia, inflammatory bowel disease) for bowel obstruction should be presumed to have small bowel tumor until proven otherwise. (See <a href=\"#H31873532\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171515831\" class=\"local\">'Tumor'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171516007\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal stricture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171516056\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic intramural hematoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H939842446\" class=\"local\">'Gallstones or foreign body'</a> above and <a href=\"#H939842785\" class=\"local\">'Intussusception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of mechanical small bowel obstruction depends upon the site and etiology of obstruction. Patients can present with acute symptoms of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, intermittent obstructive symptoms (asymptomatic periods between episodes), or with chronic postprandial discomfort and abdominal distention. Vomiting can be severe in patients with proximal small bowel obstruction, while in patients with distal small bowel obstruction, abdominal distension may be more prominent. (See <a href=\"#H413451751\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute small bowel obstruction, routine laboratory studies help assess the presence and severity of hypovolemia and electrolyte abnormalities and may indicate the possibility of complications (eg, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis). Although there are no reliable laboratory markers for bowel ischemia, elevated serum lactate is sensitive but not specific. Laboratory studies in patients with chronic bowel obstruction are usually normal. (See <a href=\"#H87987279\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of acute mechanical small bowel obstruction can be made by history and physical examination in many patients, particularly those with a history of prior abdominal surgery, or an obviously strangulated hernia. However, abdominal imaging is generally needed to confirm a diagnosis of mechanical bowel obstruction, identify the location of obstruction, judge whether the obstruction is partial or complete, identify complications related to obstruction (ischemia, necrosis, perforation), and determine the potential etiology, all of which will help determine the urgency and nature of further treatment (conservative, endoscopy, surgery). (See <a href=\"#H939839435\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H939846527\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, we suggest obtaining plain abdominal films to confirm a suspected diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction. Findings on plain film that indicate that small bowel obstruction is present include dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels, proximal bowel dilation with distal bowel collapse, or a gasless abdomen. For many patients, no further radiologic tests will be needed because the films may demonstrate findings that indicate the immediate need for urgent decompression (eg, sigmoid volvulus) or surgical intervention (eg, pneumoperitoneum, cecal or midgut volvulus). (See <a href=\"#H2972181\" class=\"local\">'Plain radiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice for identifying the specific site (ie, transition point, small versus large bowel) and severity of obstruction (partial versus complete, or closed-loop obstruction); determining the etiology by identifying hernias, masses, or inflammatory changes; and for identifying complications (ischemia, necrosis, perforation). (See <a href=\"#H2972188\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal CT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H104559350\" class=\"local\">'Complete obstruction and closed-loop obstruction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171509351\" class=\"local\">'Bowel ischemia and perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients may require additional studies to diagnose obstruction if abdominal CT is equivocal (eg, chronic symptoms, partial obstruction) or abdominal CT cannot be performed (eg, contrast allergy, inability to transport patient). These might include ultrasound, magnetic resonance enterography, or contrast studies.
