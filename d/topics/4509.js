Acute RRTs include intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs), and hybrid therapies such as prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapies (PIRRTs), which provide prolonged but still intermittent dialysis.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of CRRT modalities. Acute intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and PIRRT are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-hemodialysis-prescription\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute hemodialysis prescription&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications to perform RRT in AKI are the same for all modalities, but the choice of modality might differ. Specific indications include fluid overload, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and signs of uremia. Indications are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most institutions, intermittent hemodialysis is the standard RRT modality for hemodynamically stable patients. Based on clinical practice patterns, the major indication for choosing CRRT over intermittent hemodialysis is hemodynamic instability. Hypotension is widely believed to be less common with CRRT (although can still occur) because the rates of fluid and solute removal are slower than with intermittent hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. However, randomized trials have not proven that there is improved hemodynamic stability among patients treated with CRRT compared with intermittent hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>CRRT is particularly beneficial for hemodynamically unstable patients who require ongoing, large-volume fluid administration, such as multiple intravenous medications, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>. Because CRRT is a continuous therapy, the net solute removal over 48 hours is higher than with intermittent hemodialysis, despite the lower rate.</p><p>In many centers, CRRT is preferred to intermittent hemodialysis for patients with acute brain injury or other causes of increased intracranial pressure who have AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is because intermittent hemodialysis is more likely to worsen cerebral edema via a decrease in mean arterial pressure (which causes compensatory cerebral vasodilation) and via a rapid removal of urea resulting in a shift of water to the intracellular space.</p><p>Intermittent hemodialysis rather than CRRT may be better for the treatment of patients with severe hyperkalemia (ie, electrocardiogram [ECG] changes, such as worsening peaked T-waves or QRS prolongation, that are refractory to calcium supplementation), even if the patient requires vasopressors during the treatment. Even with using the highest effluent rates possible with the CRRT, bulk potassium removal with standard intermittent hemodialysis or prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT) is much more efficient on a minute-to-minute basis. This requires clinical judgment and often depends on multiple other variables including the availability of dialysis nursing staff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419961088\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF CRRT MODALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple CRRT modalities that differ from each other primarily according to the mechanism of solute transport. In RRTs, solutes are removed by diffusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> convection. Diffusion is the primary mechanism that underlies standard hemodialysis, although some convection does occur. Diffusion is driven by solute concentration differences between blood and dialysate. Convection is operative in hemofiltration and is the movement of solute within fluid down a hydrostatic pressure gradient.</p><p>No specific CRRT modality has been shown to provide better outcomes. In most cases, the choice of CRRT modality within individual institutions depends on availability and the expertise of the clinician. In some settings, the technique depends on the degree to which solutes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluid must be removed. As an example, slow continuous ultrafiltration is used exclusively to remove fluid but is not useful for patients who require solute removal.</p><p>All modalities for CRRT used today utilize venovenous circuits with blood flow through the <span class=\"nowrap\">dialyzer/hemofilter</span> driven by an extracorporeal blood pump (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63514\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63514 \">figure 1</a>). All require placement of a dual-lumen intravenous hemodialysis catheter.</p><p>Arteriovenous modalities, in which blood flow was driven by the gradient between the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and venous pressure, are no longer used because of risks associated with the need for arterial access (embolization, bleeding). The only advantage to arteriovenous modalities was that they did not require a blood pump.</p><p>Commonly used modalities are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1467541686\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CVVH uses hydrostatic pressure to induce the filtration of plasma water across the hemofilter membrane. Solutes are removed entirely by convection. Dialysate fluid is not used.</p><p>The ultrafiltration flow rate is high (20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As a result, replacement fluid must be given to prevent volume depletion. The amount of replacement fluid that is given is determined by the net volume removal that is desired.</p><p>Small- and middle-molecular-weight molecules (ie, &lt;5000 Daltons) such as urea and electrolytes are removed in roughly the same concentration as the plasma. There is therefore no change in the plasma concentrations of these solutes by hemofiltration. However, the administration of substitution fluid lowers by dilution the plasma concentrations of solutes such as urea and creatinine that are not present in the substitution fluid.</p><p>The removal of urea (and probably other small, lipid-soluble solutes) may also be increased by administering the replacement fluid before the hemofilter; this predilution lowers the plasma urea concentration, thereby allowing urea to diffuse from within red cells into the plasma water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3767943654\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CVVHD primarily removes solute by diffusion. Dialysate fluid is used. As in intermittent hemodialysis, dialysate fluid is run countercurrent to the direction of blood flow at a rate of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour</span>.</p><p>By contrast to CVVH, the ultrafiltration rate is generally only 2 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The dialysate flow rate is 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span>.</p><p>In CVVHD, ultrafiltration is limited to the rate at which net fluid removal is desired, and no intravenous fluid replacement is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1644237672\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CVVHDF combines diffusion with convection.</p><p>CVVHDF requires infusions of both replacement fluid and dialysis fluid. Similar to CVVH, the ultrafiltration volume is variable, and replacement fluid must be given to maintain euvolemia. The amount of replacement fluid that is given is determined by the net volume removal that is desired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32621345\"><span class=\"h2\">Slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCUF is used to treat isolated fluid overload. SCUF is not useful in patients who are uremic or hyperkalemic, because solute removal is minimal. SCUF can safely remove up to 8 L of fluid per day. Neither replacement fluid nor dialysate fluid is used.</p><p>Convective solute loss is limited since the ultrafiltration rate is low compared with CVVH. There is no diffusive solute loss since dialysate fluid is not used.</p><p>The blood flow is generally 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and the ultrafiltration rate 2 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2066372669\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ACCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRRT requires reliable vascular access capable of blood flows of at least 200 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. The standard is a double-lumen tunneled or nontunneled dialysis catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among end-stage renal disease patients who have arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) or arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) for maintenance hemodialysis, the fistulas or grafts should not be used for CRRT unless no other access is possible, because of the risks of dislodging the needle and causing bleeding or injury to the AVF or AVG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The preferred catheter access site is the right internal jugular vein, although the femoral vein may be used, if necessary. The subclavian vein should be avoided, if possible, as subclavian catheters have been associated with stenosis of the subclavian vessel, which may prevent placement of future AVFs or AVGs.
