The blood pressure frequently often rises early after kidney transplantation after saline loading interacts with initial high-dose immunosuppression. Long-term blood pressure is often easier to control after transplantation, as long as the individual achieves a good GFR. However, poorly controlled blood pressure is common among kidney transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In a single-center study, for example, only 5 percent of kidney transplant patients were normotensive, as defined by blood pressures less than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg, as measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Elevated blood pressure and pulse pressure can result in decreased allograft survival and left ventricular hypertrophy, with the latter being an independent risk factor for heart failure and death in the general population and renal transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].

Multiple cross-transplantation studies in experimental models of genetic hypertension have shown that the inherited tendency to hypertension resides primarily in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A similar relationship may exist in humans. In one report, transplantation of a kidney from normotensive donors with a negative family history of hypertension led to prolonged normotension in six recipients with a prior history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to benign nephrosclerosis and resistant hypertension while on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A larger study of 85 patients found that elevations in blood pressure and increased antihypertensive drug requirements occurred much more frequently in recipients from &quot;normotensive&quot; families who received a kidney from a donor with a &quot;hypertensive family&quot;; a family history of hypertension in the recipient blunted the effect of a &quot;hypertensive&quot; kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A follow-up study found that a &quot;hypertensive&quot; kidney transplanted into a recipient from a &quot;normotensive&quot; family had a greater hypertensive response during an acute rejection episode than did all other donor-recipient combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which genetic factors affect renal function and predispose to the development of hypertension are not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-the-pathogenesis-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in the pathogenesis of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The importance of other factors that promote the development of hypertension varies at different times after transplantation. In the immediate posttransplant period, for example, an acute elevation in blood pressure usually reflects volume overload, graft dysfunction due to rejection, ischemia, or calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. Reversal of rejection or removal of excess fluid with diuretics or dialysis will lower the blood pressure in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Studies in cardiac transplants suggest that sympathetic activation may be an additional factor that can raise the blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An alternate hypothesis is that the increase in vascular resistance results in inadequate relaxation rather than active vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients need maintenance antihypertensive therapy, especially if pulse or high-dose daily glucocorticoids, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a></span> are given. Glucocorticoids are usually not a major risk factor for chronic hypertension in transplant recipients because of rapid dose reduction. They may, however, play a contributory role since gradual withdrawal of glucocorticoid therapy from stable renal transplant recipients results in a fall in blood pressure in most patients; this effect is greatest in those with preexisting hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, in a randomized trial of steroid avoidance or continuation with 5 mg daily from three months, there was no difference in the incidence of hypertension or number of drugs needed to manage hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of calcineurin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> for maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, posttransplant hypertension was most often mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin system, either in the native kidneys or in the rejecting allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although these factors may still contribute, calcineurin inhibitors play a predominant role if administered, raising the blood pressure in almost all patients and producing overt hypertension in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/11,12,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,24</a>].</p><p>The importance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> can be appreciated from results in bone marrow and cardiac transplantation, settings in which renal dysfunction is less likely to be present. The incidence of hypertension after these procedures was below 10 percent prior to the availability of cyclosporine, but is approximately 30 to 60 percent after bone marrow transplantation and 70 to 100 percent after cardiac transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/12,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,25</a>]. Although blood pressure is reportedly lower with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> than with cyclosporine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> and tacrolimus can exacerbate underlying hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> acts by increasing both systemic and renal vascular (primarily affecting the afferent arteriole) resistance. How this occurs is incompletely understood. Increased release of vasoconstrictors, particularly endothelin, has been thought to play an important role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. As an example, cyclosporine continues to induce transient renal vasoconstriction with prolonged therapy in humans; this response is temporally related to an elevation in urinary endothelin excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A pathogenetic role for endothelin in this setting is suggested by the observation in rats that the administration of an endothelin receptor antagonist blunts the rise in blood pressure induced by cyclosporine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Additional factors may include increased sodium transport in the loop of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posttransplant hypertension due to renal transplant artery stenosis is important to identify because it is a correctable form of hypertension. Although it can present at any time, renal artery stenosis usually becomes evident between three months and two years posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The risk factors for renal transplant artery stenosis include difficulties in harvesting and operative techniques (such as improper suturing and trauma), atherosclerotic disease, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and delayed allograft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/14,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,32,33</a>]. In a retrospective study of 29 recipients with stenosis and a case-control group of 58 patients, an increased risk of stenosis was significantly associated with CMV infection (41 versus 12 percent) and delayed function (48 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of anastomotic renal transplant artery stenosis is difficult to assess. This is due in part to discrepancies in the definition of hemodynamically significant lesions and the use of different diagnostic modalities. It has been suggested that functionally significant stenosis occurs in up to 12 percent of transplant recipients with hypertension, with a range of incidence from 1 to 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>As with other causes of bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral stenosis in a solitary kidney, the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) to a patient with transplant renal artery stenosis can lead to a reversible decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/24,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>). Thus, an elevation in plasma creatinine concentration in this setting is suggestive but not diagnostic of renovascular disease in the graft. Persistent uncontrolled hypertension, flash pulmonary edema, and an acute elevation in blood pressure are other common features of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although various different imaging techniques may be utilized to diagnose renal artery stenosis, arteriography is the preferred modality. However, since arteriography is invasive, magnetic resonance (MR) arteriography or computed tomography (CT) angiography are increasingly utilized techniques to screen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diagnose transplant recipients for the presence of renovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/24,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Arteriography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal arteriography remains the procedure of choice for establishing the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis in the solitary transplanted kidney. A renal allograft biopsy is generally performed prior to angiography to rule out chronic rejection or other form of renal parenchymal disease. These findings decrease the likelihood of a successful response to correction of a stenosis and therefore are relative contraindications to intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/10,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,36</a>].</p><p>As previously mentioned, however, given the invasiveness of arteriography, several alternatives for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis have been evaluated. These include ultrasonography, MR imaging, spiral CT angiography, and radioisotope renography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some centers, Doppler ultrasonography is the preferred screening modality for stenosis of the transplanted renal artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/33,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,37-39</a>]. Data suggest that this technique is highly accurate, but is highly dependent upon the experience of the ultrasonographer. In one prospective study of 109 patients, the detection of stenosis with color Doppler ultrasonography was compared with intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. When renal artery stenosis was defined as more than a 50 percent reduction in vessel diameter, the finding of a peak systolic velocity of &ge;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/second</span> was associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 95 percent for the detection of stenosis, respectively. In general, reported sensitivities have ranged from 58 to 100 percent, while specificity ranges from 87 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in the nontransplant population, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can be utilized to screen for renal artery stenosis among transplant recipients. Technical improvements have resulted in enhanced detection of significant renal artery disease. In one study of nine transplant patients, for example, combined analysis using gadolinium-enhanced MRA and three-dimensional phase contrast postgadolinium had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 percent in detecting stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>However, the administration of gadolinium during MR imaging has been strongly linked to an often severe disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis among patients with moderate to severe renal disease, particularly those requiring dialysis. As a result, it is recommended that gadolinium-based imaging be avoided, if possible, in patients with an estimated GFR (eGFR) less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. There is no consensus among experts concerning the decision to administer gadolinium among patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.

Evaluation of a small number of patients suggests that renography may be more useful in predicting the physiologic significance of a moderately severe stenotic lesion as patients with a negative renogram are unlikely to respond to correction of the stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The options available to correct stenosis of the renal artery include angioplasty (with or without stenting) and surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Angioplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous balloon angioplasty may be technically successful in up to 80 percent of cases, although 20 percent will develop recurrent stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/36,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,44</a>].

Surgery should therefore be considered only in patients with resistant hypertension or with proximal recipient arteriosclerotic disease. Success rates have ranged from 60 to 90 percent. However, recurrent stenosis may occur in approximately 10 percent, and graft loss has been reported in up to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/45,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS AND GOALS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Goal blood pressure is based in part upon the presence or absence of proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/3,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,51</a>]. For transplant recipients who do not have proteinuria, a reasonable target blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/90</span> mmHg.

The composite outcome included doubling of the fraction of renal cortical volume occupied by interstitium (or &quot;interstitial expansion,&quot; which is a measure of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">[IF/TA])</span> at five years, or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from <span class=\"nowrap\">IF/TA</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Use of losartan tended to be protective, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.39 (95% CI 0.13&ndash;1.15, p = 0.08). However, losartan had no significant effect on time to a composite of ESRD, death, or doubling of creatinine level. The mean time to doubling of serum creatinine was longer in the losartan group, compared with placebo (1065 versus 450 days [hazard ratio (HR) 7.28, 95% CI 2.22&ndash;32.78]). In a secondary analysis, losartan appeared to reduce the risk of a composite endpoint, including of doubling of interstitial volume or all-cause ESRD (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13&ndash;0.99).
