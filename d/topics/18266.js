A meta-analysis of 41 studies (n &gt;50,000 primary care patients) found that among all of the patients with a depressive disorder, the general practitioners identified depression in approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Another meta-analysis (36 studies) found that nonpsychiatric physicians did not diagnose depression in over 50 percent of their depressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, these findings should be interpreted with recognition of the primary care approach to diagnosis over several office visits, the complexity of diagnosing depression in the context of chronic general medical illnesses, and that depressed patients who present to primary care practices may be less severely ill than patients who present to psychiatric practices. </p><p>This topic reviews the assessment and diagnosis of depression in adults.

Clinicians can ask, &ldquo;During the last two years, have you had a period of two or more consecutive months when you had none of the problems you just described?&rdquo; Recall of such a period can be followed by questions about specific symptoms, because these follow-up questions often reveal that the symptom free interval was less than two months. Two months with no symptoms or the near absence of symptoms is generally regarded as defining remission from the depressive episode.

Medication use and a review of systems are also part of an assessment of potential contributors to the depressive condition.</p><p>In some studies, the evaluation of patients with general medical disorders for major depression has focused upon the five mood and cognitive symptoms of depression.

More detailed physical examination should be pursued as guided by the history and review of systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105621646\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with depressive symptoms in the absence of general medical symptoms or findings on examination, the utility of screening laboratory tests has not been demonstrated. Nevertheless, we suggest focused tests for new onset depression (especially if the psychosocial context or precipitant is not clear), severe depression (particularly patients with melancholic or psychotic features), or treatment-resistant depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Commonly performed screening laboratory tests include complete blood count, serum chemistry panels, urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (pregnancy), and urine toxicology screen for drugs of abuse. </p><p>Additional laboratory evaluations should be pursued as guided by the medical history, review of systems, and physical examination. More extensive testing (eg, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folate, and electrocardiogram) is often indicated for patients who have chronic medical conditions, or are at increased risk for medical illnesses, including elderly or institutionalized patients, and patients with self-neglect or substance use disorders. &#160;</p><p>Neuroimaging studies are typically reserved for patients whose evaluation suggests an increased likelihood of structural brain disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These include focal neurologic signs on physical examination or persistent cognitive impairment. However, it is reasonable to obtain neuroimaging in older depressed patients, especially patients with new onset depression in later life. </p><p>A study has reported that a highly sensitive and specific panel of blood tests can differentiate patients with major depression from individuals without major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; however, the study is limited and the tests are not a substitute for interviewing patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. At the beginning of the study, patients with major depression were already diagnosed as such with clinical interviews, so it is not clear that the tests provided any benefit. In addition, the study excluded many types of patients who present with depression, including patients with substance use disorders, other medical problems (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), or a history of bipolar disorder, as well as patients taking commonly used drugs (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antidepressants). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86498830\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for depression is discussed separately.

A structured instrument enables the interviewer to clarify ambiguous or contradictory responses, and may help differentiate the diagnosis of unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) from bipolar depression. However, structured instruments are labor intensive and generally reserved for specialized evaluation, treatment, or research settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105621652\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest diagnosing unipolar depressive disorders according to the criteria in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In DSM-5, the depressive disorders that can be diagnosed include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91114\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91114 \">table 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Substance/medication</span> induced depressive disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressive disorder due to another medical condition &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other specified depressive disorder (eg, minor depression)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unspecified depressive disorder</p><p/><p>Each of the disorders is characterized by dysphoria (sad or irritable mood) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As with other psychiatric disorders defined by syndromes, each depressive disorder likely represents an etiologically heterogeneous group of conditions, with similar clinical manifestations, that are not currently distinguishable and that do not yet have differentially targeted treatments.</p><p>DSM-5 criteria for major depression appear to perform similarly across different languages, ethnicities, and cultures. A study examined DSM-IV criteria for major depression (which are similar to DSM-5) in China, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States, using female patients with recurrent depression from clinical settings and individuals from community samples (total n &gt;7000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The analyses indicated that the criteria measured the same underlying construct between the Chinese and Western samples, and among the different Western samples. &#160;</p><p>A reasonable alternative to DSM-5 for diagnosing depressive disorders is the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For major depression, the two sets of criteria are largely the same, whereas for other disorders such as dysthymia, the criteria differ substantially. ICD-10 mentions premenstrual tension syndrome (called premenstrual dysphoric disorder in DSM-5) as a diagnosis, but provides no diagnostic criteria. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not included in ICD-10.</p><p>Use of explicit criteria sets for diagnosing depression may help avoid overdiagnosing depressive syndromes on the basis of a few symptoms, which may be better attributed to another (general) medical illness or may represent non-diagnosable (&ldquo;subthreshold&rdquo;) depressive symptoms, for which the evidence base regarding treatment is lacking. Meta-analyses estimate that among primary care patients who are diagnosed with depression, the rate of false positives is 15 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]; these findings should be interpreted with recognition of the time pressures imposed upon primary care clinicians. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26342747\"><span class=\"h2\">Unipolar major depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) is characterized by a history of one or more major depressive episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 3</a>) and no history of mania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106 \">table 1</a>) or hypomania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, prior experience with the same criteria suggests that the reliability can be very good when clinicians are trained to apply the diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>In some studies, the diagnosis of major depression in patients with general medical disorders has focused upon the five mood and cognitive symptoms of depression, that is, dysphoria, anhedonia, worthlessness or excessive guilt, impaired concentration and decision making, and suicidal ideation and behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Less emphasis was placed upon the four somatic symptoms of depression (ie, anorexia, insomnia, fatigue, and psychomotor activity), because these may be attributable to general medical conditions (eg, cancer or myocardial infarction).

By contrast, in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms can and do occur in the absence of major depression. The clinical features and diagnosis of unipolar major depression with psychotic features, schizophrenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F54426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54426 \">table 6</a>), and schizoaffective disorder are discussed separately, as is the assessment of depression in patients with schizophrenia.

However, adjustment disorder is diagnosed only if symptoms do not meet criteria for another specific disorder (eg, major depression or another depressive disorder).</p><p>Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is classified in the category trauma- and stressor-related disorders, and is marked by depressed mood that occurs in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor (eg, marital conflicts, job loss, academic failure, or persistent painful illness with progressive disability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The stressor may be a single event or there may be multiple stressors, and a stressor may be recurrent or continuous. &#160;</p><p>The diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low mood, tearfulness, or feelings of hopelessness that occur in response to an identifiable stressor within three months of onset of the stressor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms are clinically significant as evidenced by at least one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant distress that exceeds what would be expected given the nature of the stressor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impaired social or occupational functioning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The syndrome does not meet criteria for another psychiatric disorder (eg, unipolar major depression) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The syndrome does not represent an exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric disorder</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The syndrome does not represent bereavement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the stressor and its consequences have ended, the syndrome resolves within six months </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71011782\"><span class=\"h2\">Sadness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periods of sadness and irritability (dysphoria) in the absence of other symptoms do not warrant the diagnosis of a depressive disorder. As an example, the diagnosis of unipolar major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 3</a>) requires not only that the dysphoria occurs for most of the day for nearly every day for at least two weeks, but that the dysphoria is accompanied by at least four other depressive symptoms as well as significant distress or psychosocial impairment. Sadness and irritability are a normal, adaptive part of the human condition, particularly in response to loss, disappointment, or perceived failure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO REFER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to refer patients to a mental health specialist will depend on many factors: the primary care clinician's own level of expertise and confidence in assessing, diagnosing, and treating depression; the availability of mental health specialty resources; and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> preference.
