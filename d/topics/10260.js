However, there are concerns about the systemic effects of ICS, particularly as they are likely to be used over long periods of time, in infants, children, and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The safety of ICS has been extensively investigated since their introduction for the treatment of asthma 30 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. </p><p>This topic review will present the local and systemic side effects of ICS, and address other concerns that are often raised by patients regarding these medications. The various types of inhalers used for asthma therapy and the numerous side effects of orally administered glucocorticoids are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF LOCAL DEPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects due to the local deposition of inhaled glucocorticoid in the oropharynx and larynx may occur. The frequency of complaints depends on the specific drug, dose, frequency of administration, inhaler technique, and the delivery system used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysphonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysphonia (hoarse voice) is a common complaint among users of inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS). Reported incidences vary from 1 to 60 percent, depending on the patient population, device, dose, length of observation, and manner of data collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Limited data are available for hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-based metered dose inhalers (MDIs), but it appears that HFA-based inhalers have a lower risk for dysphonia than older, mostly discontinued chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-based MDIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Dysphonia is sometimes reduced by using a spacer with the MDI, although results are variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The risk of dysphonia may be lower with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> dry powder inhaler (DPI) compared with CFC-MDIs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate DPI, although it is difficult to compare across drugs, doses, and devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In one study of patients using fluticasone propionate DPI, the rate of dysphonia was 20 percent overall and 36 percent among women over the age of 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of ICS-associated dysphonia may involve factors such as myopathy of laryngeal muscles (manifest as incomplete closure or bowing of the vocal cords on adduction), mucosal irritation, and laryngeal candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Dysphonia due to myopathy or mucosal irritation is reversible when treatment is withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Dysphonia may be disabling in singers and lecturers, although it is not troublesome for many patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical candidiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush) may be a problem in some patients, particularly elderly patients, patients taking concomitant oral glucocorticoids or antibiotics, and patients inhaling glucocorticoids at high dose or more often than twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a systematic review of trials of ICS for COPD, the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis was increased among ICS users compared with placebo (OR 2.65, 95% CI 2.03-3.46; 5586 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>For patients using MDIs, large volume spacer devices may protect against thrush by reducing the amount of drug deposited in the oropharynx. In addition, rinsing the mouth and throat with water and expectorating the rinsate after use of all forms of ICS is preventative. The treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-oropharyngeal-and-esophageal-candidiasis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis&quot;, section on 'Oropharyngeal candidiasis'</a>.)</p><p>Laryngeal candidiasis is a less common complication of ICS, but has been reported in up to 15 percent of patients complaining of dysphonia during ICS therapy. Isolated laryngeal candidiasis, presenting with dysphonia and sometimes throat pain, has been described in association with ICS in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/12,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dysphonia'</a> above.)</p><p>Case reports have also described esophageal candidiasis among a few patients using high dose ICS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100383861\"><span class=\"h2\">Contact hypersensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic contact dermatitis has occasionally been described due to ICS, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. An erythematous, eczematoid eruption is typically noted around the mouth, nostrils, or eyes. Typically, the patient taking inhaled glucocorticoids is affected, although individuals administering these medications have also been affected in cases of occupational contact hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis can be confirmed with patch testing, and most budesonide-allergic patients can be managed by changing to another inhaled glucocorticoid that does not cross-react with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These adverse effects may be rectified by switching to a dry powder inhaler (DPI), although some patients (1 to 9 percent) report cough or dysphonia with ICS administered by DPI and rare patients with milk sensitivity react to milk proteins contaminating the lactose in DPI formulations. &#160;</p><p>Other unusual local complications of ICS include perioral dermatitis, tongue hypertrophy, and increased thirst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioral-periorificial-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioral (periorificial) dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the known adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) to have similar effects. A critical issue in the study of systemic side effects from ICS is whether a measurable effect translates into a significant clinical consequence. As biochemical markers of systemic glucocorticoid effects become more sensitive, systemic effects are more readily detectable. However, determining clinical relevance necessitates careful, long-term follow-up studies, which are difficult to perform and are often confounded by the effects of the diseases themselves, the administration of intermittent oral glucocorticoids, and other co-morbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors influencing risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient's risk of developing adverse systemic effects from ICS is influenced by several factors, including the dose delivered to the patient, the site of delivery (ie, mouth, lungs, gastrointestinal tract), the delivery system used, individual differences in the response to the glucocorticoid, and individual comorbidities (eg, age, sex, cigarette smoking, dietary calcium and vitamin D, activity level). Sporadic case reports of dramatic adverse systemic effects from ICS are likely due to idiosyncratic reactions caused by abnormal pharmacokinetic handling of the drug in a particular individual. </p><p>The pharmacokinetics of ICS administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) or dry powder inhaler (DPI) are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59553 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 60 to 90 percent of a dose delivered from a <span class=\"nowrap\">MDI/DPI</span> is deposited in the oropharynx, swallowed, and subsequently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Drug that is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract undergoes &quot;first pass metabolism&quot; in the liver, primarily by the CYP3A2 enzyme subfamily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This first pass metabolism results in the majority of the absorbed drug being converted into inactive forms for excretion. The remainder enters the systemic circulation and contributes to systemic side effects. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ten to 40 percent of a dose from an MDI enters the airways of the lungs, although the proportion varies among formulations. As examples, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciclesonide</a> HFA has approximately 60 percent delivery to the lungs compared with about 55 to 60 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a> HFA and 80 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a> HFA and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate HFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> dry powder inhaler (DPI) has approximately 15 to 28 percent lung deposition, while the fluticasone propionate DPI has 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The lung fraction exerts the therapeutic effect and is then absorbed directly into the systemic circulation. Thus, the drug that is absorbed from the lung has relatively greater systemic impact compared to that absorbed through the gut because there is no first pass after lung absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic effects of ICS may be less detectable in patients with more severe asthma, possibly because airflow limitation inhibits delivery of drug to the lung periphery where systemic absorption occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciclesonide</a> are slightly different from other ICS because ciclesonide is delivered to the airways as an inactive compound that is subsequently converted by esterases to the active metabolite. It also has low oral bioavailability and a high clearance rate, potentially decreasing systemic side effects, such as adrenal suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. However, further testing is needed, using well-controlled, dose ranging, long duration studies with relevant clinical outcomes, before these theoretical advantages can be considered clinically important. </p><p/><p>Certain medications can influence the risk of systemic adverse effects. Medications that inhibit cytochrome p450 3A4 (CYP450 3A4) have the potential to impair the metabolism of inhaled glucocorticoids, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciclesonide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a>, and increase their serum levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The co-administration of budesonide and the potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, has been reported to result in adrenal suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Co-administration of fluticasone (propionate or furoate) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> has been associated with iatrogenic Cushing syndrome, due to CYP450 3A4 inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p>The addition of intranasal glucocorticoids to high-dose ICS (eg, in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma) likely increases the systemic exposure to glucocorticoids, although the contribution to adverse effects has not been specifically quantified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis#H25107368\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;, section on 'Safety in children and adults'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26406375\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenal suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic administration of glucocorticoids causes hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression by reducing corticotropin (ACTH) production, which reduces cortisol secretion by the adrenal gland. The degree of HPA suppression is dependent on dose, duration, frequency, and timing of glucocorticoid administration. The risk of symptomatic adrenal suppression or acute adrenal crisis by ICS therapy is small, particularly when the doses used are within the recommended ranges.</p><p>The evaluation of adrenal insufficiency in adults is discussed separately.

The guidelines recommend having a high level of suspicion for adrenal insufficiency, as clinically significant acute adrenal insufficiency has been reported in children on ICS, albeit rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Thus, testing for adrenal insufficiency should be performed in children and adolescents who are taking long-term ICS (eg, &gt;6 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and have symptoms suggesting adrenal insufficiency, including hypoglycemia, altered mental status, fatigue, weakness, anorexia, Cushingoid features, growth failure, or weight loss. Those with hypoglycemia, altered mental status, or hypotension should be evaluated urgently for adrenal crisis, and treated presumptively with stress glucocorticoids, if indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>The guidelines also suggest screening asymptomatic children and adolescents who are at high risk, which they define as taking a high daily dose of ICS (eg, age 5 to 11 years, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day),</span> particularly those with a low BMI. However, we prefer to determine the need for screening of asymptomatic patients individually, based on the presence of the following risk factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term (&gt;6 months) ICS use at doses <strong>exceeding</strong> those considered &quot;high&quot;; the tables provide age-based ranges for high-dose ICS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68517 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78011 \">table 4</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term use of intranasal glucocorticoids in addition to high-dose ICS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent use of systemic glucocorticoids and long-term high-dose ICS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low BMI (eg, &lt;15<sup>th</sup> percentile for age) </p><p/><p>To screen for adrenal insufficiency, the first step is measurement of serum cortisol in the morning (eg, 8 AM). Because cortisol normally peaks in the morning, a low level suggests adrenal insufficiency. The results are interpreted as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A morning cortisol &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL,</span> suggests probable adrenal insufficiency. This is sufficient to make the diagnosis if the patient is symptomatic. If the patient is asymptomatic, an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> should be performed to evaluate further for adrenal insufficiency. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A morning cortisol 3 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> is inconclusive. In most cases, the child should be further evaluated with an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> or referred to a specialist, especially if the child is symptomatic. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A morning cortisol level &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> is reassuring, but does not completely exclude adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation with an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> may be appropriate if the patient is symptomatic. </p><p/><p>When the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> is performed, the guideline recommends using the low-dose of ACTH (1 mcg intravenously), with measurements of cortisol at baseline and 30 minutes at a minimum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A peak cortisol level below 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> is consistent with adrenal insufficiency.

In one study, for example, the effect of ICS on bone mineral density was more prominent among postmenopausal women with asthma, than premenopausal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

In a separate case control study, fracture risk increased with the dose of ICS, and for those taking &gt;1600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> of ICS the odds ratio for fracture was 1.8 (95% CI 1.04-3.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. </p><p>A few prospective studies and a meta-analysis found no association between ICS use and decline in bone mineral density or risk of fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/17,54,105-108,118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,54,105-108,118,119</a>]. It is possible that the duration of follow-up and size of these studies were insufficient to detect an effect because changes in bone mass take years to develop. Among patients with respiratory disease, bone mineral density is also affected by factors such as cigarette smoking and activity level. In a retrospective cohort study, the relative risk of nonvertebral, vertebral, and hip fractures were modestly increased among ICS users compared with healthy controls, but not different from those using inhaled bronchodilator therapy, suggesting that some of the risk of fracture was related to respiratory disease rather than ICS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Alternatively, studies showing no increase in fracture risk with ICS use could suggest that increased mobility due to improved respiratory status associated with ICS may partially offset the deleterious effects of ICS therapy on bone metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone health in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A dose-dependent reduction in bone formation with use of ICS has been demonstrated in older children by monitoring sensitive markers for bone metabolism (serum alkaline phosphatase, bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, carboxypropeptide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122</a>].

These effects may result from loss of extracellular ground substance within the dermis, due to an inhibitory effect on dermal fibroblasts. There are reports of increased skin bruising and purpura in patients using high doses of inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a>, but the degree to which these patients were also receiving intermittent oral glucocorticoids was not described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Easy bruising in association with ICS is more frequent in elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]; there are no reports of this problem in children.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dysphonia'</a> above.) Whether systemic absorption of ICS can cause more generalized myopathy is less clear. Isolated case reports describe skeletal muscle weakness that resolved with cessation of ICS therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].

There is no evidence for adverse effects of ICS on the pregnancy, the delivery, or on the fetus. In contrast, poorly controlled asthma may increase the incidence of perinatal mortality and retard intrauterine growth, and more effective control of asthma with ICS may reduce these problems.

Concerns about adverse effects arise with ICS because these medications are typically used over many years and are administered to infants, children, and older adults who may be more susceptible to the adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local deposition of ICS in the oropharynx and larynx most commonly causes dysphonia or thrush. Dysphonia may be less common with devices that produce smaller-sized particles. Thrush can often be avoided by use of a large volume <span class=\"nowrap\">spacer/chamber</span> with metered dose inhalers (MDI) and rinsing of the mouth and pharynx thoroughly and expectorating the rinsate after each administration of ICS with all devices. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Effects of local deposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An individual's risk of systemic side effects from ICS is influenced by the cumulative dose, delivery system, individual differences in response to the glucocorticoid, and degree to which the drug is absorbed at different sites (eg, lung versus gastrointestinal tract). The pharmacokinetics of ICS administered by MDI are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59553 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Factors influencing risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A critical issue in the study of systemic side effects from ICS is whether a measurable short-term effect translates into a significant clinical consequence with long-term use. Careful follow-up studies are needed to determine this. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Systemic adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, both ICS therapy and untreated asthma itself have been associated with deceleration of growth velocity. The effects are most pronounced with severe asthma. Inhaled GC cause growth deceleration when assessed by very sensitive measures of growth velocity. However, asthmatic children continue to grow over a long period of time, and their ultimate adult height is approximately 1.2 cm less than without ICS. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Skeletal effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy with ICS can affect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, although the effects seem to be infrequent and largely subclinical. For patients receiving ICS therapy within the recommended ranges, the risk of symptomatic adrenal suppression or acute adrenal crisis appears to be very small. However, clinically significant acute adrenal insufficiency has been reported, albeit rarely. (See <a href=\"#H26406375\" class=\"local\">'Adrenal suppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ICS can increase intraocular pressure and enhance the formation of cataracts. The magnitude of these effects appears to be small, although prospective studies are required to better define them. Until the risk is better defined, adults receiving ICS therapy over years should be monitored for these complications with regular ophthalmologic exams. (See <a href=\"#H26407358\" class=\"local\">'Ocular effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, the impact of ICS on the bone density and osteoporotic fracture is not well defined. The majority of studies suggest that ICS therapy is associated with an accelerated decrease in bone mineral density, and at least a few studies have detected a small but significant increased risk for fracture. Suggestions for monitoring and protecting bone health in adult patients receiving high-dose ICS are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F95505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95505 \">table 5</a>).
