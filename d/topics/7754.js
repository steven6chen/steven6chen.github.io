First recognized in 1818 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], it was not until 1940 that GCTB was formally distinguished from other tumors of bone, such as aneurysmal bone cyst, chondroblastoma, and nonossifying fibroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although regarded as a benign tumor, GCTB represents a continuum of neoplasia, and clinical behavior is not predictable based upon clinical, radiographic, or histologic features. GCTB can be locally aggressive, and it has a propensity to recur locally after curettage alone. Furthermore, in about 2 to 3 percent of cases, distant metastases occur, most often to the lungs. However, pulmonary metastases do not carry the same connotation as metastases associated with malignant tumors, such as lung cancer or sarcoma. In most cases, clinical behavior is benign, and metastatic disease does not lead to the death of the patient, hence the designation &quot;benign pulmonary implants&quot;. Rarely, GCTB undergoes true malignant transformation.</p><p>Historically, there has been a lack of prospective, randomized clinical trials to guide clinical management of GCTB, partly owing to the rarity of these tumors and to their primarily surgical treatment. Retrospective data from large single-institution series has provided some degree of consensus as to optimal local management. More recently, improved understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of GCTB has led to the identification of new targeted therapies for the disease. The most promising of these is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa B [NF-kB] Ligand), a molecule that appears to be critical to the pathogenesis of GCTB.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the epidemiology, clinical and imaging features, staging, pathology and molecular pathogenesis, and treatment approaches for GCTB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, GCTB accounts for approximately 3 to 5 percent of all primary bone tumors and 15 to 20 percent of all benign bone tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A slightly higher incidence was suggested in a population-based series from the Swedish Cancer Registry; of the 4625 bone tumors diagnosed over a 53-year period, 505 were GCTB (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Asian populations have a significantly higher incidence than do Western populations. In China, GCTB represents approximately 20 percent of all primary bone tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>GCTB usually occurs after skeletal maturity, with a peak incidence in the 20s and 30s, and there is a slight female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. The disease is extremely rare before the age of 20. Patients who develop a GCTB before epiphyseal closure tend to have a higher incidence of vertebral primary tumors and multicentricity as compared to those who develop the lesion after skeletal maturity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, this has not been seen in all series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>There is an increased incidence of giant cell tumors in patients with Paget disease of bone. They typically occur in the skull or pelvic bones of patients who have longstanding polyostotic disease and also can arise in nonosseous tissues (extraskeletal osteoclastoma). There are reports of familial clustering of both Paget disease and GCTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interestingly, a rare congenital, sporadic syndrome closely resembling Noonan syndrome is associated with predisposition to giant-cell rich lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Noonan syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common presentation of a GCTB is pain, swelling, and limitation of joint movement at the primary site. The most commonly affected sites are the epiphyses of the long bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76662\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76662 \">figure 1</a>); approximately one-half of all cases affect the distal femur or proximal tibia. Less commonly involved sites include the vertebra, pelvis, sacrum, the skull and craniofacial bones, and the small bones of the hands and feet. Patients with tumors in the axial skeleton may present with neurologic signs and symptoms.</p><p>In approximately 10 to 35 percent of patients, thinning of the bone cortex in weight-bearing regions can result in a pathologic fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. The articular surface may be involved.</p><p>Most cases are solitary; multicentric GCTB accounts for less than 1 percent of total reported cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As noted above, patients with multicentric disease tend to be younger than those with a solitary GCTB. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>In rare circumstances, patients may present with metastatic disease, mostly in lung. However, in general, lung metastases are most common in the setting of locally recurrent disease (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging workup</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modern imaging techniques to determine the extent of disease involvement incorporate a combination of anatomic (x-ray, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and functional (bone scan, positron emission tomography [PET]) scans. On plain x-rays, GCTB typically appears as an expansile eccentrically-placed lytic area, which is the result of intratumoral hemorrhage. The lesion normally involves the epiphysis and the adjacent metaphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50795 \">figure 2</a>), and there is frequent extension to the subchondral plate, sometimes with joint involvement. Matrix calcification and reactive periosteal new bone formation are typically absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Compared to plain radiographs, CT scans give a more accurate assessment of cortical thinning and penetration, and the presence or absence of bone mineralization. Primary bone formation within the tumor suggests the presence of a primary osteosarcoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-tumors-diagnosis-and-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone tumors: Diagnosis and biopsy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MRI is particularly useful for assessing the integrity of the surrounding soft tissue, including neurovascular structures, and the extent of subchondral extension into adjacent joints. The characteristic findings on MRI are an expansile hypervascular mass with cystic changes and heterogeneous low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and intermediate to high intensity on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Large amounts of hemosiderin are often present, accounting for areas of low signal intensity in both T1 and T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Based upon the radiographic findings, the differential diagnosis may include a lytic metastasis (particularly an expansile highly vascular metastasis from renal cell or thyroid carcinoma), a primary bone tumor, a brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism, an aneurysmal bone cyst, or nonossifying fibroma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Osteitis fibrosa cystica'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chest CT may be indicated to evaluate for the presence of pulmonary metastases. However, given that metastatic spread is most common in the setting of a local recurrence, we routinely order a chest CT only in patients who have locally recurrent disease.</p><p>Radionuclide bone scan may be helpful in staging multicentric disease. Changes on bone scan, typically decreased uptake of radiotracer in the center of the tumor, are not specific for GCTB. Aneurysmal bone cysts have a similar appearance. As with chest CT, there is no consensus as to the indications for obtaining a bone scan.</p><p>There are limited data regarding the utility of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET for newly diagnosed GCTB. Unlike many benign bone tumors, GCTB accumulate the FDG tracer, presumably because the osteoclast-like giant cells are intensely metabolically active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, whether there are any advantages to evaluation with FDG PET as compared to conventional imaging with CT, MRI, and bone scan is unclear.</p><p>Changes in FDG uptake over time correlate with tumor metabolism and angiogenic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In our experience, FDG-PET is a highly sensitive biomarker of response to targeted therapeutics. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'RANKL inhibitors: Denosumab'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different classifications of GCTB based upon histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and <span class=\"nowrap\">clinical/radiographic</span> appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] have been proposed. As an example, the Campanacci grading system stratifies patients according to clinical and radiographic appearance as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; Intraosseous lesions with well-marginated borders and an intact cortex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II &ndash; More extensive intraosseous lesions having a thin cortex without loss of cortical continuity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III &ndash; Extraosseous lesions that break through the cortex and extend into soft tissue</p><p/><p>However, classification systems such as these are of limited clinical utility. They do not correlate well with histologic appearance, and provide little prognostic information regarding the risk of local recurrence or metastatic behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the generally benign nature of most GCTBs, the spectrum of disease behavior is highly variable and unpredictable. There are varying degrees of local aggressiveness, and focal symptoms typically result from bony destruction, cortical breakthrough, and expansion into soft tissues. Disease within the axial skeleton, which is often unresectable, can cause severe and debilitating local complications.</p><p>Some cases behave in a malignant fashion. However, the term &quot;malignant&quot; GCTB includes multiple entities and therefore can be confusing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In about 2 to 3 percent of cases, metastases develop, most often in the setting of locally recurrent disease, and most frequently to the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, in general, pulmonary metastases from a GCTB do not carry the same connotation as do metastases from other solid tumors such as sarcoma. For most patients, the clinical outcomes remain consistent with the generally benign character of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], hence their designation as &quot;benign&quot; pulmonary implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20</a>]. However, in a small number of cases, pulmonary metastases (particularly if accompanied by metastases in other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]) contribute to death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/11,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an extremely small number of cases, true spontaneous malignant transformation of GCTB is reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. The term &quot;malignancy in giant cell tumor&quot; is used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to designate a high-grade sarcoma arising in a GCTB (primary) or at the site of a previously documented GCTB (secondary) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some cases of secondary malignancy represent a radiation-induced sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. When a primary malignant GCTB is discovered, it may represent a primary bone sarcoma with prominent areas of hemorrhage and giant cell reaction that was missed at initial diagnosis rather than malignant transformation of a GCTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When true malignant transformation does occur within a GCTB, the prognosis is worse than for a benign GCTB, yet somewhat better than for other high-grade sarcomas. Five-year survival rates in two series of 28 and 26 cases of malignant GCTB, were 50 and 82 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGY, HISTOGENESIS, AND MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grossly, GCTB is a fleshy, reddish tumor often containing cystic and hemorrhagic areas. The tumor may breach the cortex and extend into soft tissues, and there is little or no periosteal reaction.</p><p>Microscopically, the tumor is composed of sheets of round to oval polygonal or elongated mononuclear cells which are interspersed with uniformly distributed large osteoclast giant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When the tumor is present in the lung, the histologic features are identical to the primary tumor, including the presence of giant cells.</p><p>The prominent multinucleated cells, which may exceed 50 percent of the total cell content of the tumor, are thought to derive from circulating monocytes which have converted into osteoclasts in the osseous environment. This conclusion is supported by light, ultrastructural, and immunological marker studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>].</p><p>It is generally accepted that the characteristic large osteoclastic giant cells are not neoplastic. The mononuclear cells, which represent the neoplastic component, are thought to arise from primitive mesenchymal stromal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These cells have characteristics of osteoblast progenitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>] and express RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-kB) Ligand), a growth factor that is essential for the recruitment of osteoclasts by osteoblasts and their maturation under normal physiologic conditions. The role of RANKL in the molecular pathogenesis of GCTB is discussed further below.</p><p>Testing for the presence of mutations in the H3 histone family 3A (<em>H3F3A</em>) gene may help to support the diagnosis when it is in doubt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Histologic grading does not appear to be of value in predicting either locally aggressive behavior or the development of metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The stromal cells show no cytologic features suggestive of malignancy, unless associated with malignant transformation (which is rare, (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above)).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of giant cell tumor includes other giant cell and osteoclast-rich tumors, including aneurysmal bone cyst, nonossifying fibroma, fibrous metaphyseal defects, giant cell rich osteosarcoma, chondroblastoma, and brown tumor associated with hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, mutations in the <em>H3F3A</em> gene can serve to distinguish GCTB from other entities, as they are identified in up to 96 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. However, the presence of a mutation in <em>H3F3A</em> does not entirely exclude malignancy in other osteoclast-rich tumors, such as chondroblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, or nonossifying fibroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,47</a>]. In particular, chondroblastomas have a high frequency of mutations in histone 3.3 genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The distinction between benign and &quot;malignant&quot; giant cell tumor may be difficult since the transformed element (atypical cells) may be relatively difficult to detect in a &quot;sea&quot; of reactive giant cells. This problem is exacerbated by the sampling limitations that are inherent in the use of core or fine needle biopsies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Histogenesis and molecular pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histogenesis of GCTB is incompletely understood. While it is currently believed that the neoplastic component of giant cell tumor is derived from the stromal compartment, the specific cellular origin remains uncertain. The stromal cells show no cytologic features of malignancy. This fact, along with the inability of the stromal cells to form clones in semisolid medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/42,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48</a>], and the lack of clonal cytogenetic structural aberrations in GCTB in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/28,39,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,39,49</a>] has led some to question whether GCTB represents a true neoplasm or a reactive condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>However, in support of a neoplastic etiology, at least one array-based comparative genomic hybridization study has identified 20q11 amplifications in 54 percent of GCTBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Centrosome amplification has been described in GCTB, and appears correlated with recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Furthermore, increased telomerase activity and prevention of shortening of the telomeres have been commonly reported in GCTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Data suggest over-expression of p53 in 20 percent of GCTB, consistent with mutation of this gene, and which was associated with increased risk of recurrence and metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These molecular features are generally considered &quot;proof&quot; of the neoplastic nature of a neoplasm. This remains the subject of research.</p><p>RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa B [NF-kB] Ligand) appears to be critical to the pathogenesis of GCTB. Under normal physiologic conditions, osteoclast formation requires an interaction with cells of the osteoblastic lineage, which may depend upon cell-cell contact, and the interaction of RANKL (a member of the tumor necrosis factor [TNF] ligand family, which is also known as osteoclast differentiation factor [ODF] or TRANCE, MIM 602642) with its receptor RANK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. RANK is highly expressed on monocytes, while its ligand, RANKL, is expressed by a variety of cell types, including stromal cells and lymphocytes. A variety of coregulatory molecules also participate in osteoclast formation, including monocyte-colony stimulating factor (CSF1), vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related protein, and prostaglandins. The subject of skeletal development is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several studies identify RANKL as highly expressed by the stromal cells within a GCTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/39,43,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43,58,59</a>]. The stromal cells also appear to secrete factors that can prevent or regulate osteoclastogenesis; this includes osteoprotegerin which blocks <span class=\"nowrap\">osteoblast/osteoclast</span> interaction and functions as a secreted natural negative regulator of RANKL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/38,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,56</a>].</p><p>It is thought that RANKL expression by the osteoblast-like mononuclear stromal cells stimulates recruitment of the osteoclastic cells from normal monocytic pre-osteoclast cell. The osteoclastic giant cells then actively absorb host bone via a cathepsin K- and matrix metalloproteinase 13-mediated process, which would account for the osteolysis associated with these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/38,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,60,61</a>]. The most compelling data supporting the importance of RANKL signaling to the pathogenesis of GCTB comes from a seminal phase II trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> which provides proof of concept that interdicting RANKL signaling is a powerful and effective strategy in this disease. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'RANKL inhibitors: Denosumab'</a> below.)</p><p>However, many questions remain. The underlying basis for the high levels of expression of RANKL by the stromal cell has not been clarified, since it does not appear that there is amplification or translocation of the RANKL gene (which is at the chromosome 13q14 locus). Data suggest that the transcription factor <span class=\"nowrap\">CCAAT/enhancer</span> binding protein beta <span class=\"nowrap\">(C/EBPbeta)</span> is over-expressed and regulates RANKL, but it is unclear what drives <span class=\"nowrap\">C/EBPbeta</span> expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Noonan syndrome, variants of which are associated with giant cell-rich lesions, are reported linked to germline mutations in the PTPN11 or the SOS1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. A link to RANKL expression has not been reported.</p><p>Furthermore, it is thought that there is in vivo signal or factor that must be present to stimulate the expression of RANKL by the stromal cells since isolation of stromal cells from GCTB in vitro results in rapid loss of expression of RANKL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Finally, although RANKL is likely being secreted by the stromal cells, higher levels of expression of RANKL are observed in the osteoclast-associated cultures than in purified stromal cells derived from GCTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Mutations in the <em>H3F3A</em> gene, which are present in over 90 percent of GCTB, may be driving tumorigenesis; it has been shown that these mutations are restricted to the stromal cell population and are not detected in the osteoclasts or their precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Whatever the driver mutational events, it is likely that the neoplastic stromal cell possesses an immature osteoblast phenotype, part of whose transcriptional repertoire includes RANKL, in addition to other markers of the early osteoblast lineage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Options for surgical treatment include intralesional curettage (alone or followed by filling of the defect with bone cement with or without bone grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]), marginal excision, a wide local excision, or en bloc resection with or without reconstructive surgery. The type of surgery chosen depends on the site and size of the tumor in relation to surrounding structures and tumor extent, and whether or not a pathologic fracture has occurred which may compromise reconstructive options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>Reported rates of local recurrence vary substantially depending on the extent of resection and whether or not an adjuvant was used in conjunction with intralesional curettage (see below). It is generally accepted that the status of the surgical resection margins is the single best predictor of outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/16,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,68</a>]. </p><p>En bloc or wide local excision is associated with the lowest recurrence rates. Recurrence rates with intralesional curettage alone are as high as 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/16,69-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,69-72</a>], and may be even higher in certain sites such as the distal radius and proximal femur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The inherently greater risk of local recurrence after curettage alone must be weighed against the likelihood of later successful treatment of a recurrence, and the functional defect and later risks associated with large resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. Except for the proximal fibula or distal ulna, en bloc or wide margin resections necessitate major articular reconstruction with loss of function. Thus, these procedures cannot be recommended as standard given the usually benign behavior of GCTB, and the high rates of local control when intralesional curettage is combined with an adjuvant such as bone cement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/68,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,71</a>]. En bloc excision is generally reserved for cases involving the proximal fibula or distal ulna, a second or later recurrence, and some cases presenting with a pathologic fracture (see below).</p><p>In some series, recurrence rates are low with curettage alone in patients whose tumors are confined to bone, but higher in those with extraosseous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Because of this, lesions with extraosseous extension (ie, Campanacci grade III lesions, (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above)) have been traditionally treated with en bloc resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>]. Some data support the view that GCTB with extraosseous extension can be successfully treated with intralesional curettage in conjunction with cementing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/66,67,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67,80</a>], but this is not a widespread approach.</p><p>In some series, pathologic fracture has been a risk factor for local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/18,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,81</a>], leading some to suggest that intralesional surgery (curettage) should be avoided in such cases. However, others have not found a difference in local recurrence rates between patients who have a GCTB with and without a pathologic fracture at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Management of these patients must be individualized depending upon the nature of the fracture and the implications for reconstruction. En bloc resection is generally recommended if the articular surface is grossly damaged or if there is a dislocated intraarticular fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Local adjuvants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an attempt to decrease local recurrence rates after intralesional curettage, various surgical adjuvant therapies have been tried. Examples include the use of bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/18,69,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,69,74</a>], aqueous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc chloride</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], phenol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>], cryotherapy with or without cement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/70,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,85,86</a>], argon beam coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and the use of a high-speed burr to remove peritumoral bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/11,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,87</a>].</p><p>There are no randomized trials to support benefit of a local adjuvant over curettage alone. In contemporary retrospective series of patients treated with intralesional curettage with a local adjuvant, local recurrence rates are 13 to 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/18,66,70,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,66,70,88</a>], which compare favorably with those seen following wide local excision. However, a large series suggested no benefit from the use of local adjuvants, provided there is adequate surgical tumor removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>There are also no trials comparing outcomes with different adjuvant approaches. However, bone cement has emerged as the preferred adjuvant agent. Filling the cavity with bone cement allows immediate weight bearing, and the heat induced during the setting of the cement is thought to kill any remaining tumor cells, thus decreasing the risk of a local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. Furthermore, the radiologic features of a cement-filled cavity are ideal to permit early identification of local recurrences.</p><p>The beneficial effect of filling the curettage cavity with cement was shown in a retrospective series from the Scandinavian sarcoma group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among patients undergoing intralesional surgery, recurrence rates were significantly lower in the 147 patients who had the cavity filled with cement compared to the 47 who had intralesional surgery without cementing (22 versus 56 percent). Among the 27 patients who had intralesional surgery followed by filling of the cavity with a bone graft only, the local recurrence rate was 61 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h4\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taken together, these data suggest that intralesional surgery (curettage) is the treatment of choice for potentially resectable intraosseous GCTB. Packing of the cavity with an adjuvant such as bone cement decreases the risk of a local recurrence. Indications for more extensive surgery may include extraosseous extension, tumor involving the proximal fibula or distal ulna, a dislocated pathologic fracture, or one in which the articular surface is grossly damaged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of local recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three fourths of all local recurrences develop within two years, and the remainder within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/18,81,92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,81,92,93</a>]. Thus, surveillance beyond five years is not needed, except for monitoring of functional outcomes, especially following reconstructive surgery.</p><p>In general, locally recurrent potentially resectable GCTB can be successfully treated by further curettage and local adjuvant therapy with only a minor risk of increased morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/75,92,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,92,94</a>]. More extensive surgery is indicated for a second or later recurrence. For patients with unresectable locally recurrent disease, options include radiation therapy, arterial embolization, and systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Given that most cases of pulmonary metastases develop in patients who have locally recurrent disease, a screening chest CT is reasonable in the setting of a local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

One example of where this might be the case is a large midline sacral GCTB. Resection of a small sacral tumor to one side of midline may be possible without unacceptable morbidity if one set of sacral nerves can be preserved, providing reasonable postoperative bladder and bowel function. However, a complete resection of a large midline sacral GCTB would necessitate sacrifice of both sets of sacral nerves, leading to permanent double incontinence.</p><p>Radiation has also been used as an adjuvant therapy to reduce local recurrence rates after intralesional surgery for spinal GCTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]. There are no trials comparing radiation therapy versus a local adjuvant such as bone cement or burring in this setting.</p><p>Given the young age of most of these patients, a major concern with RT is the risk of radiation-induced malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/97,104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,104,105</a>]. The magnitude of the risk is not definitively known. While several reports cite no increased risk of malignancy in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/96,98,106-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,98,106-108</a>], at least one series notes an 11 percent risk of radiation-induced sarcoma among patients undergoing radiotherapy for a primary or recurrent GCTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-associated-sarcomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-associated sarcomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Largely because of concerns for malignant transformation, guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7731\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> suggest that RT be considered only after other options have been exhausted. However, an important point is that the published series included patients treated with older orthovoltage radiation techniques where the doses absorbed by bone would have been substantially higher than the prescription dose. Lower rates are expected with modern megavoltage irradiation. A more recent large series reported a 2 percent rate of malignant transformation in 77 patients treated between 1985 and 2007 with megavoltage radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Newer techniques, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy, appear promising but data are preliminary at this stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. In our view, radiation therapy using modern techniques remains a reasonable approach for patients with a GCTB at a site where surgical margins can only be achieved with unacceptable morbidity (as, for example, with a large midline sacral GCTB with no chance of preserving at least one set of sacral nerve roots), or if the patient is a poor surgical candidate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Sacral tumors and arterial embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, large midline GCTB of the sacrum are difficult to treat. Surgery carries a high risk of morbidity and disability, and radiation carries at least the potential risk of long-term malignant transformation. Successful treatment with arterial embolization has been described, although published experience is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local recurrence is accompanied by an increased risk of &quot;benign&quot; pulmonary implants.

Only 13 had a local recurrence before or at the time of metastatic spread. Other involved sites were scalp, the calf muscle, and regional lymph nodes.

Benefit in patients with GCTB was shown in a phase II study in which 37 patients with recurrent or unresectable GCTB were treated with denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously every 28 days, with two additional loading doses on days 8 and 15 of the first month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Thirty patients (86 percent) had an objective response to therapy, which was defined as either &ge;90 percent elimination of giant cells on histologic evaluation or the absence of radiographic progression of the target lesion up to week 25. There was also sustained suppression of markers of bone turnover, as early as 28 days after the first dose, and sustained for the duration of the study, and a reduction in uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), suggesting that FDG-PET may be an early and sensitive marker for clinical response in GCTB. </p><p>Treatment was well tolerated in general.

In a preliminary report presented at the 2014 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), paired pre- and posttreatment FDG-PET scans from 26 patients (144 scans) showed marked reductions in standardized uptake values (SUV) at the first posttreatment scan (median 68.5 days from the first dose) with sustained and progressive reductions in maximal SUV (SUVmax) with continued denosumab treatment.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer#H664779873\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'Antiresorptive therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The available data on long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> treatment of GCTB are limited to a single report detailing the combined experience of 97 patients treated with denosumab from 2006 to 2014 in two centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. All patients received denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously on days 1, 8, 15, and 29, and every four weeks thereafter. Forty-three patients underwent tumor resection, with a median time on denosumab treatment of 12 months (range 6 to 45 months); 54 had unresectable disease (14 with lung metastases and 34 with relapse after prior surgery), with a median time on treatment of 54 months (range 9 to 115 months). In the unresectable group, tumor control and clinical benefit were observed in all patients, while 40 percent of those discontinuing denosumab had disease progression after a median of eight months off therapy (range 7 to 15 months). After six months, pain completely disappeared or decreased in 73 percent. Overall, six patients developed ONJ (with five of the six cases occurring with prolonged therapy); 11 had mild peripheral neuropathy, nine had skin rash, and four developed an atypical fracture.</p><p>These data suggest that interdicting RANKL signaling is an effective strategy in this disease. In June 2013, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> was approved in the United States for treatment of patients whose GCTB cannot be surgically removed or when surgery is likely to result in severe morbidity, such as loss of limbs or joint removal. Approval was based upon review of data from 305 adult or adolescent patients treated on two clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/133,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">133,140</a>] who had a GCTB that was either unresectable or where surgery would result in severe morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. Reduction in tumor size was seen in 47 of the 187 patients who had measurable disease after an average of three months of denosumab, and regrowth was only seen in three after an average observation period of 20 months. </p><p>Although not approved for treatment of GCTB elsewhere, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> is approved in several other countries for the treatment of osteoporosis or prevention of skeletal related events from bone metastases. Denosumab is recommended as a treatment option for patients with unresectable GCTB in guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7731\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>. Importantly, the duration and optimal schedule of treatment required for patients with GCTB is not yet known. The US FDA approval did not stipulate a dose. The schedule used in the trials conducted to date in GCTB is denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously every 28 days, with two additional loading doses on days 8 and 15 of the first month.</p><p>Nonrandomized data suggest the potential for beneficial surgical downstaging with neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> in a subset of patients with potentially resectable GCTB for whom the initial planned surgery would be associated with functional compromise or significant morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/142,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">142,143</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an early report of an open-label phase II study of neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> in 222 patients with primary or recurrent GCTB for whom initial surgery was associated with functional compromise or morbidity, of the 116 patients who eventually had surgery (predominantly curettage), the local recurrence rate was 15 percent a median of 13.6 months postsurgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional information is available from a retrospective multicenter analysis of 87 patients with locally advanced GCTB who underwent surgery after preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>].

Control of GCTB growth using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> injected locally into the tumor is also reported to be of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giant-cell-tumor-of-bone/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTBs) is a benign but locally aggressive bone tumor that typically presents as a lytic lesion in the epiphyseal region of long bones in young adults, usually around the knee. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical behavior of GCTB is unpredictable. Although they are considered benign lesions, they tend to recur locally after simple curettage and can even metastasize. Pulmonary metastases do not carry the same grave prognosis as is seen with other tumors, as reflected by their designation as &quot;benign&quot; pulmonary implants. Rarely, giant cell tumor undergoes primary malignant change. There are no clinical, histologic, or radiographic parameters that can accurately predict aggressive behavior. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is the treatment of choice for a GCTB. For potentially resectable intraosseous lesions (primary or recurrent), we recommend intralesional curettage followed by filling of the cavity with bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) rather than curettage alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Indications for more extensive surgery include extraosseous extension, tumor involving the proximal fibula or distal ulna, a second or later recurrence, a dislocated pathologic fracture, or one in which the articular surface is grossly damaged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a GCTB at a site where surgical margins can only be achieved with unacceptable morbidity (as, for example, with a large midline sacral GCTB with no chance of preserving at least one set of sacral nerve roots), or if the patient is a poor surgical candidate, systemic options (ideally through a clinical trial) or radiotherapy are reasonable options. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For sacral tumors, another option is arterial embolization, although published experience is limited. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Sacral tumors and arterial embolization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local recurrence is accompanied by an increased risk of pulmonary metastases. We suggest screening of such patients for pulmonary metastases with a chest CT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management of local recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with pulmonary metastases have a favorable outcome and do not die of their disease. Nevertheless, we suggest surgery rather than observation for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If observation is chosen, close monitoring is needed for early detection of tumor progression. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary metastases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newer therapeutic agents hold promise for patients for whom local therapies are not suitable. The characterization of the role of the <span class=\"nowrap\">RANK/RANKL</span> axis in mediating the recruitment and function of osteoclast-like cells has provided a strong rationale for the use of targeted therapies, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>, which affect this pathway. Given the current weight of evidence for efficacy and safety, we suggest denosumab as a reasonable alternative to other forms of systemic therapy for patients with persistently unresectable or metastatic disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, long-term effects of denosumab in patients treated for GCTB are not fully understood and include serious complications, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'RANKL inhibitors: Denosumab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of other systemic therapies remains undefined.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Cooper AS, Travers B.
