Types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include lung, breast, kidney, colorectal, and skin (melanoma) cancers.</p><p>Brain metastases are different from primary brain cancer. Primary brain cancer happens when normal cells in the brain change into abnormal cells and grow out of control. Brain metastases are made up of cancer cells from another part of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549935458\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of brain metastases?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain metastases can cause different symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache &ndash; The headache is often worse when you bend over, cough, or sneeze. Some people have nausea and vomiting with their headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble moving your arm or leg on 1 side of your body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory or thinking problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in mood, behavior, or personality</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can make people pass out, or move or behave strangely.</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not brain metastases. But if you have cancer and get any of these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549935473\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for brain metastases?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The test most commonly done to check for brain metastases is an imaging test called an MRI. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>Another test that is sometimes done is a brain biopsy. For a brain biopsy, a doctor takes a small sample of tissue from the tumor. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549935488\"><span class=\"h1\">How are brain metastases treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on many factors, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How far the cancer has spread in your body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your overall health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your prognosis &ndash; This is the term doctors use to describe how long they expect you to live.</p><p/><p>Treatment for brain metastases can include 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove all or part of a tumor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells. Doctors use radiation in different ways to treat brain metastases. With &quot;whole brain radiation therapy,&quot; the whole brain is treated with radiation. With &quot;stereotactic radiosurgery,&quot; the radiation is aimed only at the area with cancer.</p><p/><p>People also usually have other treatments to help with symptoms or problems caused by the brain metastases. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called steroids that can reduce swelling in the brain &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to manage and prevent seizures</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549935503\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my brain metastases come back or spread?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your individual situation. Your doctor might recommend that you have more treatment for the brain metastases. This can include surgery or radiation therapy. It sometimes also includes chemotherapy, which is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Or your doctor might recommend treating your symptoms only and helping you feel more comfortable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549935518\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need to stop driving?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your symptoms. Talk with your doctor about whether it is safe for you to continue to drive, given your symptoms.</p><p>If you have a seizure, you will need to be seizure-free for a certain amount of time before you can drive again. Each state and country has its own rules.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549935533\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for brain metastases involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549935548\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
