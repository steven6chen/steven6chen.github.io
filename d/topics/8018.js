This causes the heart to lag behind in its job of moving blood through the body. As a result, fluid backs up in the body, and the organs do not get as much blood as they need. This can lead to symptoms such as swelling, trouble breathing, and feeling tired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13841262\"><span class=\"h1\">What is atrial fibrillation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial fibrillation, also called &quot;AF,&quot; is a problem with the heart's rhythm. In atrial fibrillation, the electrical signals that control the heartbeat become abnormal, and the top 2 heart chambers beat abnormally. When this happens, blood can pool in these chambers and form clots. These clots can travel up to the brain through the blood vessels and cause strokes. (A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow.)</p><p>Besides raising your risk of stroke, atrial fibrillation can make you feel like your heart is racing, skipping beats, or beating out of sync. It can also make you feel dizzy or out of breath.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13841269\"><span class=\"h1\">Can people have both heart failure and atrial fibrillation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, many people have both heart failure and atrial fibrillation. People usually have only one of these conditions at first. But then their condition &quot;stresses&quot; the heart and affects the way it works, causing the other condition to happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13841276\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know if I have both heart failure and atrial fibrillation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have both conditions, and one gets worse, then the other condition is likely to get worse, too.</p><p>If that happens, your doctor will try to figure out which condition is the bigger problem so that he or she can treat that one first. But if both conditions are causing problems, you might need treatment for both at once.</p><p>The treatment will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of your heart failure or atrial fibrillation</p><p/><p>To figure out the cause of your heart failure or atrial fibrillation, your doctor will talk with you and do an exam. He or she might also do tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13841283\"><span class=\"h1\">How are heart failure and atrial fibrillation treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatments for heart failure and atrial fibrillation are different. But your doctor can treat you for both conditions at the same time.</p><p>Doctors treat heart failure with different types of medicines (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)&quot;</a>). Most people need to take more than one medicine every day. These medicines can improve your symptoms and help you feel better. Some medicines might help you live longer.</p><p>Treatment for atrial fibrillation can include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Doctors can use different types of medicines to treat atrial fibrillation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment called &quot;cardioversion,&quot; which involves applying a mild electrical current to the heart to fix its rhythm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment called &quot;ablation,&quot; which uses heat or cold to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending abnormal electrical signals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called a &quot;pacemaker,&quot; which is put in your body and sends electrical signals to the heart to control the heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to create scar tissue in the heart to block the flow of electrical signals</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13841290\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you have new or worse symptoms of heart failure or atrial fibrillation.</p><p>Symptoms of heart failure can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden weight gain</p><p/><p>This action plan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72459 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75501 \">figure 2</a>) lists the symptoms you should watch for every day.</p><p>Symptoms of atrial fibrillation can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like your heart is racing, skipping beats, or beating out of sync</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or like you are going to pass out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild chest tightness or pain</p><p/><p>You should also learn the signs and symptoms of a stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73487 \">figure 3</a>).
