The older antidepressants such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and early tricyclic antidepressants were discovered largely by serendipity. While effective antidepressants, these medications affect a wide range of neurotransmitter systems and cause many undesirable side effects. Subsequently, psychopharmacologic research and development efforts focused upon identifying the neurochemical properties associated with the antidepressant actions of these medications and upon developing compounds with variations on their chemical structure.</p><p>As theories were developed about the neurotransmitter systems involved in depression (eg, the monoamines serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), drug development techniques progressed in parallel, leading to the formation of compounds with targeted affinities for receptors involved in specific aspects of monoaminergic neurotransmission (eg, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). The incidence of side effects were greatly reduced since these medications had less effect upon other types of receptors (eg, cholinergic, histaminic, alpha adrenergic).</p><p>Advances in the basic neurosciences have further elucidated the pathophysiology of depression and have expanded our view of the many neurotransmitter systems involved in affective illness. Current evidence suggests that the initial receptor and neurotransmitter effects of antidepressants lead to &quot;downstream&quot; changes in protein production at a cellular level; these changes in turn appear to influence elements of neuronal protection and synaptic plasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Modern psychopharmacologic research has capitalized on this information, leading to the development of &quot;designer&quot; antidepressants with effects on specific combinations of selected neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The pharmacology of MAO inhibitors is reviewed here. The pharmacology and use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), heterocyclic, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), other antidepressants, and the serotonin syndrome, are discussed separately. Switching and discontinuing antidepressants, and an overview of options for treatment in depression are also discussed separately.

They were discovered in 1952 after iproniazid (a derivative of the antibiotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>) was found to be ineffective for treating tuberculosis, but was a potent antidepressive agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The next MAOI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranylcypromine</a>, was identified as an antidepressant after it proved to be ineffective as a nasal decongestant. What these two medications have in common is the property of irreversibly blocking monoamine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This property is thought to be largely responsible for the MAOIs' antidepressant effects.</p><p>The enzyme MAO comes in two forms, MAOa and MAOb. MAOb metabolizes phenylethylamine and, together with MAOa, breaks down dopamine. MAOa is responsible for the breakdown of serotonin and norepinephrine.</p><p>MAO is distributed in tissues throughout the body. The blockade of MAOIa in the gastrointestinal tract is responsible for the &quot;cheese reaction&quot; associated with MAOIs. This refers to a severe hypertensive crisis that can occur after patients on MAOIs ingest foods containing the sympathomimetic tyramine. Tyramine is usually metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, but the blockade of MAOa allows it to flow into the general circulation. Although the accepted &quot;MAOI diet&quot; has been liberalized in recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], there are still several dietary restrictions to which patients on these medications must adhere.</p><p>MAOIs are not first or second line antidepressant medications because of their relatively extensive side effect profile, including severe adverse effects such as hypertensive crisis and the serotonin syndrome. These potential severe side effects necessitate dietary restrictions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F80345\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80345 \">table 1</a>) and caution regarding drug-drug interactions. MAOIs have potent hypotensive effects, and up to 50 percent of patients experience dizziness. This is particularly important when treating elderly patients as they may be both more sensitive to the hypotensive effects and more likely to fall and sustain fractures. Other common side effects are dry mouth, gastrointestinal upset, urinary hesitancy, headache, and myoclonic jerks. MAOIs suppress REM sleep, but the clinical significance of this is unknown. Afternoon fatigue is also common.</p><p>Despite their side effect profile, MAOIs can be effective in treatment resistant depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression#H707471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment of resistant depression&quot;, section on 'Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)'</a>.) </p><p>Although MAOIs have been touted as particularly useful for treating atypical depression (ie, depression with hyperphagia, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis, and rejection sensitivity), the clinical utility of diagnosing major depression with atypical features has been called into question. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features#H28610525\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Atypical'</a>.)</p><p>Several compounds with selective MAOa and MAOb inhibiting properties have been developed, as well as reversible MAOIs. Properties of the MAOIs most commonly prescribed in the United States for treatment of depression are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Tranylcypromine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranylcypromine</a> has a chemical structure similar to amphetamine and has some stimulant properties. It is predominantly an irreversible inhibitor of MAOa, but also irreversibly inhibits MAOb to a degree. It also appears to block reuptake of serotonin and catecholamines.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranylcypromine</a> has a rapid onset of MAOI activity, although clinical effects may not be present for two to four weeks. The mechanism by which tranylcypromine is metabolized is not clearly understood. The medication appears to maximally inhibit MAO activity at even subtherapeutic doses.</p><p>A conservative starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranylcypromine</a> is 10 mg daily. If tolerated, the dose can then be raised to 30 mg daily in divided doses. The dose can be further increased by 10 mg every week up to 60 mg daily as needed. Although some MAO activity is restored three to five days after discontinuing the medication, it is prudent to allow two weeks for full restoration of MAO activity after stopping tranylcypromine.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranylcypromine</a> shares the side-effect profile of other MAOIs. It has the potential to interact with sympathomimetics leading to hypertensive crisis, to interact with serotonergic medications leading to the serotonin syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>), and can cause dose-related hypotension, sexual dysfunction, and sleep disturbance. Patients on tranylcypromine may have transient blood pressure increases after dosing, which subsides in three to four hours.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranylcypromine</a> is more likely than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a> to cause activation and insomnia, so the last dose should be given early in the day. It is less likely than phenelzine to cause weight gain; some patients even experience weight loss.</p><p>Care must be taken in starting and stopping <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranylcypromine</a>, to avoid precipitating a hypertensive reaction or the serotonin syndrome (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initiating or discontinuing MAO Inhibitors'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Phenelzine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenelzine</a> is a substituted hydrazine that irreversibly inhibits MAOa and MAOb. The metabolism of phenelzine is not clearly understood. </p><p>Patients can be started on 15 mg on day one, and increased to 15 mg three times daily over two to three days as tolerated. The dose can be titrated upwards to a dose of 60 to 90 mg as tolerated.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenelzine</a> shares the common MAOI side effects of potential for interactions with sympathomimetics leading to hypertensive crisis, interactions with serotonergic medications leading to serotonin syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>), dose-related hypotension, sexual dysfunction, and sleep disturbance. It may cause less insomnia than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranylcypromine</a>, but it seems more likely to cause weight gain, sedation, and sexual dysfunction. Phenelzine can very rarely cause hepatotoxicity.</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a> is correlated with at least 80 to 85 percent inhibition of platelet MAOb activity, which typically requires a dose of at least 60 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, there is a wide range of percent inhibition of the MAO enzyme for a particular dose among different patients. Thus, monitoring MAOb platelet inhibition (when available) can help guide treatment if full therapeutic doses for adequate duration (eg, four to eight weeks) fail to produce a clinical response, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> side effects limit dose increases. Clinical antidepressant effects may not be seen until three to six weeks of continued treatment.</p><p>Care must be taken in starting and stopping <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a>, to avoid precipitating a hypertensive reaction or the serotonin syndrome (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initiating or discontinuing MAO Inhibitors'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Selegiline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Selegiline</a> is a selective MAOb inhibitor at low doses and a non-selective MAO inhibitor at higher doses. Selegiline primarily increases dopaminergic neurotransmission at lower doses, and increases serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission at higher doses. Low dose selegiline does not appear to have antidepressant properties and is primarily used in treatment of Parkinson disease; it does not require dietary restrictions because of its lack of inhibition of MAOa.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Selegiline</a> functions as a traditional MAOI at higher dose. It inhibits both MAOa and MAOb, has antidepressant properties, and, when taken orally, requires dietary restrictions to prevent hypertensive reactions.</p><p>A transdermal patch form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> (EMSAM) was approved by the FDA in 2006 for use in the treatment of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Daily transdermal administration of selegiline allows for dosing that is high enough to produce antidepressant effects (by inhibiting MAOa and MAOb), but bypasses the gut. Direct inhibition of MAOa in the GI tract is avoided when transdermal selegiline is used at a dose of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours.</p><p>There are no dietary restrictions when transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> is used at the recommended starting and target dose, 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours. MAOI dietary restrictions are required if the 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours or 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours patch is used, because of limited clinical and experimental experience with higher doses. While it is not known if doses higher than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours are clinically more effective, clinicians may prescribe higher doses based on clinical judgment. Dose increases should occur in increments of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours (up to a maximum dose of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours) at intervals of no less than two weeks.</p><p>Care must be taken in starting and stopping <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a>, to avoid precipitating a hypertensive reaction or the serotonin syndrome (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initiating or discontinuing MAO Inhibitors'</a> below).</p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> patch is the first transdermal antidepressant and is of particular benefit to patients who cannot take oral medications. Patients who respond to the 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hour dose may avoid dietary restrictions. Limited data are available to determine which patients are likely to respond at this dose, and whether higher doses, necessitating MAOI dietary restrictions, are indicated for patients who do not respond.</p><p>Two randomized studies, both using the 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hour patch, found that short term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> (six and eight weeks), compared to placebo, improved depression scores and, in patients with less severe depression, increased remission rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiating or discontinuing MAO Inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antidepressants should be stopped two weeks before beginning <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranylcypromine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranylcypromine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> to avoid precipitating a hypertensive reaction or the serotonin syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because of its longer half-life, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> should be stopped five weeks before using a MAO inhibitor.
