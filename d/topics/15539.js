Medical treatment failure is often apparent early in the course of treatment. In these cases, referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center is appropriate to explore additional therapeutic options, including epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, and the ketogenic diet.</p><p>There is no standardized definition of medically intractable epilepsy. A task force of the International League Against Epilepsy proposed that drug-resistant epilepsy be defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used antiseizure drug schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses the management and prognosis of seizures and epilepsy in children who are not controlled with initial antiseizure drug therapy.

In addition, clinicians should consider whether the diagnosis of epilepsy is accurate, as misdiagnosis is common. Common mimics of seizures include psychogenic nonepileptic seizures and other nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81289 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Additional reasons for apparent treatment failure that do not reflect true intractability include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An incorrect diagnosis or seizure classification (ie, focal versus generalized), leading to an inappropriate antiseizure drug choice that might be aggravating seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78021 \">table 2</a>).

The pharmacokinetics of either drug can be altered by the other; serum levels may have to be monitored closely.</p><p/><p>A second antiseizure drug may also be considered in children with several different seizure types when monotherapy is not effective. In one practice, the clinicians found that children with status epilepticus, developmental disabilities, and multiple seizure types were more likely to require polytherapy than those without these features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Virtually every combination of antiseizure drugs has been used.

If the seizures increased, a third drug often was added. The first or second antiseizure drug may actually have increased the seizure frequency, and the problem was compounded further with the addition of more antiseizure drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most of the antiseizure drugs have been reported to increase seizure frequency in a small percentage of patients and, in some instances, induce new seizure types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These seizures may occur at low or therapeutic doses of some drugs and at toxic doses in others. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Carbamazepine</a>, for example, can precipitate atonic seizures, particularly in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Phenytoin</a> can worsen absence seizures at therapeutic doses and cause generalized seizures at toxic doses.</p><p/><p>Thus, the initial approach to the child with intractable seizures on polytherapy is to slowly decrease the antiseizure drug that the family feels has been the least effective.</p><p>When a child has intractable epilepsy despite treatment with more than one antiseizure drug, it is also reasonable to re-evaluate the diagnosis of epilepsy and initiate referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center to determine eligibility for epilepsy surgery and other treatment modalities, such as dietary therapy and vagus nerve stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Such problems have led to increased use of transmucosal routes of antiseizure drug delivery, such as rectal, buccal, intranasal, and sublingual administration, that allow for earlier initiation of rescue therapy in the home or prehospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The largest experience is with rectal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a>, although accumulating evidence suggests that buccal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> is also safe and may be more effective than rectal diazepam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Intramuscular and intranasal administration of midazolam appears to have similar efficacy as rectal diazepam. Transmucosal administration of midazolam will likely become first-line therapy for out-of-hospital emergency therapy once a convenient formulation for nonmedical personnel is approved and available.

Of these, duration of epilepsy prior to surgery is the most consistently reported and underscores the importance of early surgical evaluation in patients with refractory seizures.</p><p>Contralateral MRI abnormalities are a common cause for concern in selecting patients for hemispherectomy, but their importance is controversial. This is demonstrated by two studies with conflicting results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective series of 110 patients who underwent hemispherectomy, 74 percent of cases had contralateral MRI abnormalities, the majority of which were described as mild to moderate, including nonspecific white matter changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

After a median follow-up of seven years, patients with contralateral MRI abnormalities had lower rates of seizure freedom (45 versus 88 percent).</p><p/><p>The definition of a contralateral MRI abnormality has varied across studies, and this may partly explain the discrepancy in results. In addition, the length of follow-up often differs, and those studies with shorter follow-up times might overestimate seizure control rates in one or both groups.</p><p>Other imaging modalities may also be helpful in selecting patients who will optimally benefit from surgery. In the largest study to date, FDG-PET activity in the contralateral hemisphere was a stronger predictor of seizure control postoperatively than MRI abnormalities; seizure freedom was achieved in 72 percent of the 119 patients with unilateral PET abnormalities and only 44 percent of the 18 patients with bilateral abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Motor and cognitive outcomes after hemispherectomy are not as well studied as seizure outcomes. Most patients already have moderate to severe hemiparesis prior to undergoing hemispherectomy. The risk of added motor deficits is approximately 25 percent in the immediate postoperative period; most children regain function to their preoperative baseline or better by one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Postsurgical developmental gains reported in most studies are modest, but development is often limited by severe preexisting brain damage that may involve the nonoperated hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/46,51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,51,53</a>].

Although seizure-free rates following temporal lobectomy may be as high as 70 to 80 percent, the longer patients are followed, the smaller this percentage becomes. A large study that examined seizure-free rates in over 600 adults 10 years after epilepsy surgery showed that only approximately 50 percent were still seizure-free [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Many patients therefore choose to remain on antiseizure medication following successful epilepsy surgery given their higher risk for seizure recurrence should they stop.</p><p>Observational studies on medication discontinuation after epilepsy surgery in children include the following series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The retrospective TimeToStop cohort study included 766 children who underwent epilepsy surgery over a seven-year period at one of 15 epilepsy centers across Europe and who began antiseizure drug reduction within a year of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The median times to antiseizure drug reduction and complete withdrawal were 13 and 29 months, respectively. Although earlier antiseizure drug withdrawal was associated with a higher risk for seizure recurrence, it did not affect long-term rates of seizure control or seizure freedom. This suggests that early antiseizure drug withdrawal may unmask incomplete surgical success sooner, identifying children who need ongoing antiseizure drug treatment and potentially sparing unnecessary continuation of antiseizure drugs in others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a separate study that included 301 children from this cohort for whom preoperative and postoperative IQ measurements were available, antiseizure drug reduction was associated with improved postoperative IQ scores, independent of other variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

If the child is seizure-free, then each drug is slowly tapered, one at a time, starting with the one that seemed least effective prior to surgery or the one thought to be causing the most adverse effects.

Further studies are therefore needed before cannabidiol or other cannabis compounds should be used outside of the context of a clinical trial. Several expanded access studies and randomized trials of cannabidiol are underway or completed in specific patient groups with drug-resistant epilepsy (eg, Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

Of the one-third of patients who did not achieve remission, 19 percent were drug-resistant (medically intractable), while 14 percent had experienced five-year remissions. A symptomatic origin was associated with failure to achieve remission and with medical intractability.

Data, particularly from animal research and human surgical specimens, increasingly indicate that the pervasive excitatory synaptic activity accompanying seizures, and probably interictal epileptiform discharges as well, lead to neuronal injury, abnormal neuronal sprouting, and interference with the normal pruning and complex rearrangement of neuronal connectivity that characterizes the developing nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].
