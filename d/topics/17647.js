Although most AKs do not progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), AKs are a concern because the majority of cutaneous SCCs arise from pre-existing AKs, and AKs that will progress to SCC cannot be distinguished from AKs that will spontaneously resolve or persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Because of these factors, most clinicians routinely treat AKs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Improvement in associated symptoms and cosmetic appearance can be additional benefits of treatment. </p><p>The treatment of AKs will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AKs are discussed separately.

In general, lesion-directed treatments, such as cryotherapy and surgical procedures, are the primary approach for isolated lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Field-directed therapies, such as topical 5-FU, imiquimod, ingenol mebutate, and diclofenac, are particularly useful for treating areas with multiple AKs. (See <a href=\"#H195277700\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> below.) </p><p>Evidence for efficacy of these therapies is derived from multiple randomized trials and systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One systematic review and meta-analysis of 83 randomized trials evaluating 24 treatments in over 10,000 patients found sufficient evidence to conclude that 3% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> in 2.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, 0.5% 5-FU, 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, and 0.025% to 0.05% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ingenol-mebutate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ingenol mebutate</a> are superior to placebo for complete clearance of lesions in the treated field in patients with AKs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, this systematic review and meta-analysis found that PDT performed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminolevulinic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminolevulinic acid</a> (ALA-PDT) with red light or blue light or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyl-aminolevulinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyl aminolevulinate</a> (MAL-PDT) with red light was superior to placebo for the treatment of individual AK lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The meta-analysis also found that treatment with imiquimod or PDT generally resulted in better cosmetic outcomes than 5-FU and cryotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent network meta-analysis of 26 individual or pooled randomized trials evaluated the relative efficacy in inducing complete lesion clearance for eight main interventions for AK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This analysis suggests that topical 5-FU is the most effective treatment followed by: 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) PDT; topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ingenol-mebutate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ingenol mebutate</a>; 5-methylaminolaevulinate (MAL) PDT; cryotherapy; topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>; and placebo. However, the ranking of relative efficacies should be interpreted with caution because of the variability in the parameters used to describe the AK severity in the included studies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101206873\"><span class=\"h2\">Destructive treatments</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy is the most widely utilized treatment for AK. This treatment may be quickly performed in an office-based setting and is well tolerated by patients.</p><p>The efficacy of liquid nitrogen was demonstrated in a study of 70 patients with a total of 1018 treated AKs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A cure rate of 99 percent was reported after one year of follow-up. Most of the lesions treated were thin, not on the arms or hands, and aggressive therapy was used (thaw times of 20 to 45 seconds). </p><p>In a subsequent prospective study including 90 patients with 421 AKs, the overall complete response rate (defined as 100 percent lesion clearance) to liquid nitrogen cryotherapy was 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The response rate varied with the freeze time (time lapse from the formation of the ice ball to the beginning of thawing), from 39 percent for five seconds of freezing to 83 percent for 20 seconds of freezing.</p><p>Although hypertrophic AKs can be effectively treated with cryotherapy, thick lesions may respond less well than thin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. AKs on the dorsum of the hand may also be more resistant to liquid nitrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical therapies for AKs include surgical excision, shave excision, curettage with or without electrodesiccation, and dermabrasion. None of these therapies has been evaluated in clinical trials and their use is based upon limited evidence from small observational studies and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical excision is not routinely used for the treatment of AKs; it is usually undertaken for lesions that warrant histopathologic examination, such recurrent or infiltrated lesions that are suspicious for invasive squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shave excision and curettage followed by electrodesiccation are frequently used for AKs, particularly for hyperkeratotic lesions. Although these techniques can provide tissue for histopathologic evaluation, the specimens are usually not adequate to determine whether a lesion is invasive or intraepidermal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermabrasion, or surgical skin planing, may be used for treating large areas such as a sun-damaged bald scalp or forehead when lesions are too large to treat effectively with topical preparations. Dermabrasion is a procedure in which a specialized hand-held instrument is used to &quot;sand&quot; the skin to improve skin contour. The surface of the epidermis of the skin (the stratum corneum) is removed, leaving the skin red and raw-looking. The procedure can be very painful and usually requires procedural sedation and analgesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A retrospective study of 23 patients treated with dermabrasion found that 96 percent remained free of new AKs at one year after treatment. However, the benefits of dermabrasion gradually diminished with 83 percent clear at two years and 54 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101207019\"><span class=\"h3\">Photodynamic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PDT is an effective therapy for AK that consists of topical application of a photosensitizer followed by exposure of the treatment area to a visible wavelength light source. 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyl-aminolevulinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyl aminolevulinate</a> (MAL) are the two photosensitizing agents utilized in PDT for AK. Applied on the skin under occlusion, these prodrugs are absorbed and converted by the heme biosynthetic pathway to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) and other intermediate photosensitizing porphyrins. PPIX selectively accumulates within the target cells during the incubation time. The subsequent exposure to red or blue light activates PPIX, leading to the selective destruction of target cells by necrosis and apoptosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photodynamic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photodynamic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following PDT, a localized, erythematous reaction similar to sunburn can typically be expected for four to seven days and may be accompanied by a tingling or burning sensation or pain, edema, minute vesicles, or crusting. Skin exfoliation follows the inflammatory reaction for up to a week. </p><p>Multiple PDT regimens have been used for treatment of AK. The topical photosensitizer, incubation times, light sources, and pretreatment regimens have varied across studies. An effect of the length of the incubation period on treatment efficacy was illustrated in a randomized trial (n = 149) in which patients were treated with a self-adhesive ALA patch. The trial found that a four-hour incubation period was more effective for complete clearance of AKs than shorter incubation times of 0.5, 1, or 2 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Multiple trials and two meta-analyses have compared PDT with other therapies for AK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/4,14-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-21</a>]. One meta-analysis of four randomized trials (641 participants with 2170 AKs) comparing PDT with cryotherapy found that PDT had a 14 percent greater likelihood of achieving complete lesion clearance at three months than cryotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although data are insufficient for definitive conclusions on comparative efficacy, the cosmetic outcome from PDT appears to be superior to 5-FU and cryotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/4,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,21</a>]. </p><p>Photodynamic therapy has the advantage of allowing the treatment of multiple lesions with a single application. The most common complaint during photodynamic therapy is burning or stinging during light exposure; in addition, there is a small risk of producing pigmentary changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85397693\"><span class=\"h4\">Daylight photodynamic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The observation that photosensitizing PPIX can be activated also by other light sources, including daylight, has led to the development of daylight PDT with MAL cream. In contrast with conventional PDT, which requires the application of the topical photosensitizer under occlusion and an incubation time of several hours, for daylight PDT, patients are exposed to daylight for two hours immediately after the application of the MAL cream. Treatment can be given under sunny as well as cloudy weather conditions.</p><p>Before daylight PDT, a broad-spectrum chemical sunscreen with high SPF (physical sunscreens such as titanium dioxide or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> should not be used to avoid blocking visible light) should be applied to all the exposed skin, including the area being treated. After exposure to daylight, residues of the MAL cream are removed with warm water and a washcloth to avoid subsequent phototoxic reactions, and patients are instructed to spend the rest of the day indoors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Treatment is followed by sunburn-like inflammation in treated areas that resolves in five to eight days.</p><p>Compared with conventional PDT, daylight PDT has several advantages, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less painful</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well accepted by patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larger areas treated on a single occasion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower costs</p><p/><p>The efficacy of daylight PDT for the treatment of multiple thin AKs on the face and scalp has been evaluated in several randomized trials performed in northern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-28</a>]. Two studies have compared daylight PDT with conventional PDT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a phase-III multicenter European intra-individual trial, 108 patients with at least five mild to moderate AK on each side of the face or scalp were treated once with daylight MAL-PDT on one side and conventional MAL-PDT on the contralateral side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The primary endpoint was complete lesion response and noninferiority of daylight PDT compared with conventional PDT at week 12. Twelve weeks after treatment, the response rates for daylight PDT and conventional PDT were similar (70 and 74 percent, respectively). Patients considered daylight PDT nearly painless compared with conventional PDT (pain scores on a 0 to 10 scale were 0.7 and 4.4, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an Australian intra-individual randomized trial, 100 patients with an average of 14 mild to moderate AK per side on face or scalp were treated once with daylight MAL-PDT on one side and conventional MAL-PDT on the contralateral side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The primary endpoint was the complete response rate for mild AKs per side at week 12. At week 12, there was no significant difference between the response rates for daylight PDT and conventional PDT (89 and 93 percent, respectively). Patients reported treatment with daylight PDT as almost painless. Treatment-related adverse events were less frequent in the daylight PDT group than in the conventional PDT group (39 and 59 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>International consensus recommendations for daylight PDT for the treatment of AK have been developed in Europe, Latin America, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/22,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,29-34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1909804393\"><span class=\"h4\">Indoor white light photodynamic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with daylight PDT is dependent upon geographic location (latitude), weather conditions, and time of year. Indoor treatment using &ldquo;artificial daylight&rdquo; would allow treatment all year round and in rainy summer days. Several commercially available sources of white light, including&nbsp;halogen lamps and white light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, have been evaluated for PDT in experimental settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In a small randomized trial, PDT using a white LED lamp was as effective and well tolerated as daylight PDT for the treatment of AK. In this split-scalp or forehead study, 22 men with a median of 20 AK per field were treated with daylight PDT on one side of the scalp and with artificial white light PDT on the opposite side one week apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. At one and nine months, the number of AKs per field was reduced by 62 and 48 percent, respectively, on the daylight PDT side and by 68 and 64 percent, respectively, on the side treated with white light PDT. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical treatments</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical 5-fluorouracil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluorouracil</a> inhibits thymidylate synthetase, a critical enzyme in the synthesis of DNA. The lack of DNA synthesis, particularly in fast-growing dysplastic cells, prevents cell proliferation and causes cell death. 5-FU 5% cream has been used with good success in patients with multiple AKs. It causes inflammation and destruction of the lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76480 \">picture 1</a>). Inflammation typically subsides approximately two weeks after 5-FU is discontinued. It typically takes four to six weeks (two to four weeks of which are active treatment) for the skin to progress through erythema, blistering, necrosis with erosion, and reepithelialization.</p><p>Two systematic reviews found an approximately 50 percent overall efficacy rate of 5-FU for 100 percent clearance of AKs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/8,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,37</a>]. However, in patients who do not have hyperkeratotic AKs (which generally require destructive modalities of treatment), topical 5-FU is effective in more than 90 percent of patients who can tolerate it, and has the advantage of treating clinically undetectable AKs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Treatment with topical 5-FU may be effective for the long-term control of AKs. In a randomized trial, 932 participants with a mean total count of 11 AKs on the face and ears were treated with 5% 5-FU cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks and followed-up for an average time of 2.6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. At six months, the number of AKs on the face or ears was reduced to 3 (73 percent reduction) and 8.1 (24 percent reduction) per participant in the treatment and control group, respectively. The complete clearance rate at six months was 38 percent in the 5-FU group and 17 in the control group. Compared with the control group, the 5-FU group was less likely than the control group to receive any spot treatment for AKs during the follow-up period and had fewer AKs at 42 months (4.3 versus 5.7). A subsequent subgroup analysis showed that fewer individuals in the 5-FU group than in the placebo group had one or more new AKs for up to 24 months after randomization and that the number of new AKs per person was significantly lower in the 5-FU group compared with the placebo group at 24 months (2.18 versus 3.68) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-actinic-keratosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>A 0.5% preparation of 5-FU for daily application is available in the United States, but not in Europe.

Field-directed therapies are indicated for the treatment of areas with multiple AKs, subclinical lesions that are not detected by visual inspection or palpation, and field cancerization (presence of genetically altered cells at risk of malignant transformation in clinically normal skin). (See <a href=\"#H3202133\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with isolated AKs be treated with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy can be used as the initial treatment for hyperkeratotic or hypertrophic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63461\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63461 \">picture 2</a>). Shave removal or curettage may be used as alternative treatment modalities, particularly for suspicious lesions requiring histopathologic examination. (See <a href=\"#H101206717\" class=\"local\">'Patients with few, isolated lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H195277989\" class=\"local\">'Patients with hyperkeratotic/hypertrophic lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H195278085\" class=\"local\">'When to biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with multiple thin lesions on the face <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scalp, we suggest field treatment with topical 5-FU, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ingenol-mebutate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ingenol mebutate</a>, or photodynamic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
