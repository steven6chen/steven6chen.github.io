In adults, palpitations occasionally herald serious underlying cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, palpitations in children typically arise from physiologic stimuli, such as fever, exercise, anxiety, or anemia, rather than life-threatening causes (eg, cardiac arrhythmia). In addition, children with serious arrhythmias may report no palpitations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of palpitations encompasses rare etiologies that are life-threatening and common causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78536\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78536 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52851 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with a serious underlying cause for their palpitations often have a history of syncope, congenital heart disease, or cardiac surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52851 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3839549\"><span class=\"h3\">Arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arrhythmias are a very uncommon cause of palpitations in children with structurally normal hearts but are frequently seen in children with surgically corrected structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Arrhythmias may be broadly classified as fast or slow. The child with tachyarrhythmia and shock should be triaged and managed per the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for assessment of cardiopulmonary instability espoused in the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A key component of this assessment requires categorization of the QRS complex from the cardiorespiratory (CR) monitor or 12-lead ECG as narrow or wide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67438\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67438 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A 12-lead ECG before and after intervention is preferable if patient status allows. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common non-sinus tachyarrhythmia of childhood and often presents with palpitations in verbal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Most infants with SVT are asymptomatic although feeding problems, pallor, or dyspnea, especially with feeding, may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ventricular tachycardia is rare in children with structurally normal hearts.

Clinical findings of myocarditis include tachycardia out of proportion to fever, poor perfusion, and signs of heart failure. Patients with myocarditis may develop a variety of tachy- and bradyarrhythmias. Children with fulminant myocarditis may rapidly develop cardiogenic shock.

Patients with HCM may present with palpitations or syncope during strenuous exercise caused by atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmia. The subset of HCM patients who present with syncope are at significant risk for sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

These symptoms and signs usually occur at higher blood glucose concentrations (between 40 and 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.2 and 3.9 mM]) than the neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms (lethargy, irritability, behavioral abnormalities, seizures, or coma), and may function as a &quot;warning system.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3839570\"><span class=\"h3\">Poisoning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxin exposures have the potential to cause life-threatening tachy- and bradyarrhythmias.

Tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla are termed pheochromocytomas, and those with extraadrenal origins are called paragangliomas. The classic triad of symptoms in these disorders consists of episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia, usually accompanied by hypertension. Malignant hypertension can occur, with its associated complications (eg, increased intracranial pressure, encephalopathy).

Hypoglycemia is a life-threatening cause of catecholamine release that warrants rapid recognition and treatment.

Patients with hyperventilation often have associated symptoms of dyspnea, chest tightness, chest pain, paresthesias, and palpitations (often described as a &quot;racing&quot; heart) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Frequently they attribute their symptoms to a life-threatening problem and appear very anxious. In addition, children with hyperventilation may have a past medical history of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>While clinical findings reveal no serious cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities, patients with severe hyperventilation may display a positive Chvostek or Trousseau sign, laryngospasm, or spontaneous carpopedal spasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. Ancillary studies (eg, venous or arterial blood gas and electrolytes) typically show respiratory alkalosis. Rarely, T wave changes, including ST segment depression, T wave flattening, and T wave inversion may appear on ECG during the hyperventilation episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Once serious etiologies, such as status asthmaticus, metabolic acidosis pain, central nervous system disorders, and drug intoxication are excluded, treatment consists of reassurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Additional measures may be necessary to end the acute episode such as placement of a partial rebreather oxygen mask with oxygen flow set below 5 liters per minute allows the patient to rebreathe carbon dioxide without causing hypoxia or benzodiazepine administration (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> up to adult dose of 5 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Patients with hyperventilation need close follow-up and counseling. Up to 40 percent of patients with hyperventilation will have repeated episodes into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3839679\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug-induced</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug induced palpitations, as opposed to toxic exposures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66773\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66773 \">table 2</a>), involve medications and substances with sympathomimetic or anticholinergic properties that increase heart rate and cardiac contractility with routine dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-palpitations/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Implicated agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a>, caffeine, tobacco, cough and cold preparations, dietary supplements that contain ephedra, herbal medications, energy drinks, recreational drugs, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isotretinoin</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3839686\"><span class=\"h3\">Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined as a form of orthostatic intolerance characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate (&gt;30 bpm over baseline or to &gt;120 bpm in adults) that occurs on standing without arterial hypotension. POTS is a common disorder among teenage girls that manifests as palpitations, anxiety, dizziness, and tremulousness.

Fever and pancarditis are clinical manifestations of this disease that can cause tachycardia. Other findings include arthralgia, arthritis, erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules, and chorea. Testing for recent streptococcal infection is essential to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral valve prolapse is associated with a wide variety of clinical features. Palpitations are a common presenting complaint in MVP. The evaluation of patients with symptomatic palpitations is similar to that in patients without MVP. Palpitations are often associated with ventricular premature beats, but supraventricular arrhythmias can also occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmic complications of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-valve-prolapse-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitral valve prolapse syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful history helps to identify patients at higher risk for a life-threatening cause for their palpitations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitation description &ndash; Palpitations caused by life threatening tachyarrhythmias often start and stop abruptly (like turning a light switch on and off). Children may feel like there is a butterfly in their chest or like their heart is beating so fast that it will come out of the chest. These palpitations generally are of short duration (seconds to minutes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Palpitations due to cardiac hyperdynamic states with sinus tachycardia are often described as a rushing or pounding in the ears, particularly when the patient is supine. Exercise, fever, anemia, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, caffeine drinks, and emotional arousal may produce this sensation of increased ventricular stroke volume that often lasts minutes to hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children with premature atrial or ventricular contractions may note the increased stroke volume of the compensatory heart beat as a &quot;flip-flop&quot; or say that their heart &quot;stops&quot;. A similar sensation may be produced in patients with bradycardia and high grade (Type II or Type III) atrioventricular block due to escape beats.

Triggers for these events involve intrinsic catecholamine stimulation such as exercise, sudden exposure to cold water (diving), or sudden surprise. Unlike vasovagal syncope, patients usually fall without protecting themselves from injury. Unlike seizures, patients usually recover full mental status without a postictal phase as long as the arrhythmia is of short duration.
