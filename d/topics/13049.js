The clinical heterogeneity of CVID suggests that multiple immunoregulatory defects can result in the final common pathway of hypogammaglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. The entity, now called CVID, will probably prove to be a group of disorders with a common endpoint of defective immunoglobulin production and dysregulated immune responses.</p><p>The hallmark immune defect in CVID is defective B cell differentiation into plasma cells, with impaired secretion of immunoglobulin. However, CVID is associated with a high incidence of inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant conditions, whereas these disorders are not observed in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a disease that specifically affects early B cell development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This suggests that CVID represents a more global form of immune dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">B CELL ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall B cell number is normal in the majority of patients, although many have reduced percentages of isotype-switched memory B cells (and lack plasma cells) capable of producing antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin isotypes that are critical for recall (or secondary) antibody responses. Examination of the B cell receptor by high resolution sequencing shows a number of abnormalities that appear to have occurred in the bone marrow. These include aberrant gene rearrangement, decreased V gene replacements, which normally occur to counteract autoimmunity, decreased diversity of the na&iuml;ve B cell repertoire, impaired somatic hypermutation, and abnormal expansion of unmutated B cell clones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Toll-like receptor signaling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B cell maturation is defective in patients with CVID, and the function of toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 9 on both B cells and dendritic cells is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Normally, B cell responses may be initiated by binding of viral RNA to TLR7 or bacterial DNA to TLR9, both of which lead to B cell activation, cytokine secretion, proliferation, and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The loss of these stimuli may contribute to the B cell defects observed. The relevance of impaired TLR9 dysfunction in CVID was demonstrated in a study showing that stimulation with microbial extracts from <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> resulted in impaired activation and proliferation of B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the mechanism(s) by which TLR function is impaired is not yet defined. The normal development of B cells and the cellular interactions that are necessary for normal antibody production in response to an antigenic challenge are reviewed separately.

Memory B cells can also be subdivided into those cells that have not yet undergone isotype-switching and produce predominantly IgM (CD27+IgM+IgD+) and those that have isotype-switched (CD27+IgM-IgD-) and synthesize IgG, IgM, or IgA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At present, determining the number of isotype-switched memory B cells is not a standard component of the diagnosis of CVID. However, it is of interest because it provides information about the immaturity of the B cell, relates to the numbers of plasma cells in the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and provides some information about selected clinical outcomes.</p><p>Studies have attempted to identify and classify CVID patients based on numbers of isotype-switched memory B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/18,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study proposed that &lt;0.4 percent switched CD27+IgM-IgD- memory B cells based on total blood lymphocytes (compared with healthy donors at 1.6&plusmn;0.6 percent) could be used to classify patients with CVID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>].

Patients selected for this analysis presented before the age of 10 years, with disorders such as autoimmune cytopenias and organ-specific autoimmune disorders, interstitial lung disease, lymphoid hyperplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver, and granulomatous infiltrations. The mutations detected were rare or private (ie, not detected in other patients or controls) and in addition to TACI, included monoallelic mutations in nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B1 (NFKB1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PIK3CD), and the gene encoding IKAROS (<em>IKZF1</em>). While in many cases these occurred in families with no apparent immune defects in other members, some of these mutations were still autosomal dominantly inherited, but with quite variable penetrance. In addition, biallelic mutations in the gene for protein &quot;lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive vesicle trafficking, beach- and anchor-containing&quot; (<em>LRBA</em>) and syntax binding protein 2 (STXBP2) were also found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>The <a href=\"http://primaryimmune.org/&amp;token=JUDqXW1Xwigp+AHTLbnw6GPo9rbhV+Fb8xTfYWk0m8JCes4Y7dwFMgV4+HCNV0iL&amp;TOPIC_ID=3904\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF)</a> has a Consulting Immunologist Program (CIP) to connect health care providers who have questions about patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency with clinicians experienced in diagnosing and managing these disorders.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disorder is characterized by defective B cell differentiation with impaired secretion of immunoglobulin. However, CVID is associated with a high incidence of inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant conditions, features of more fundamental immune dysregulation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall B cell numbers are normal in approximately 90 percent of subjects with CVID. Many patients have low percentages of isotype-switched memory B cells (and also plasma cells) capable of producing antigen-specific IgG and IgM, immunoglobulin isotypes that are critical for recall (or secondary) antibody responses. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'B cell abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell abnormalities include a low <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> T cell ratio (present in a subset of patients) and impaired responses to mitogens and antigens. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Other cellular abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CVID appears to result from a number of gene defects. which may be either recessive in inheritance or autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Some of these are due to defects of B cell signaling molecules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F107614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107614 \">table 1</a>), but additional genes affecting immune regulation may also lead to the CVID phenotype.
