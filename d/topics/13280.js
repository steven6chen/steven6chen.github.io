Early diagnosis and treatment are believed to be key elements in the prevention of long-term sequelae, such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of PID will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis of, risk factors for, and sequelae following PID are discussed separately. The management of tubo-ovarian abscess is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term complications of pelvic inflammatory disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and complications of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should maintain a low threshold of suspicion for the diagnosis of PID. The presumptive clinical diagnosis of PID is made in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) who present with pelvic or lower abdominal pain and have evidence of cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Occasionally, acute PID may be encountered in women without recent sexual activity. Treatment is indicated for patients with this presumptive clinical diagnosis of PID, even if findings are subtle or minimal, since long-term complications are more common if treatment is withheld or delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Information regarding the diagnostic criteria for PID is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENS OF CONCERN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PID is primarily a disease of sexually active women. The two most important sexually transmitted organisms associated with acute PID, <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, should be targeted for treatment; however, negative endocervical screening for either of these pathogens does not rule out upper tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>PID is a polymicrobial infection, which generally requires broad coverage, particularly among those with severe disease requiring hospitalization. Acute PID is an ascending infection caused by cervical microorganisms (including <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>), as well as the vaginal microflora, including anaerobic organisms, enteric gram-negative rods, streptococci, genital mycoplasmas, and <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em>, which is associated bacterial vaginosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Bacterial vaginosis results in complex alterations of the normal vaginal flora, which may alter host defense mechanisms in the cervicovaginal environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> is recognized as a cause of urethritis in men, but its role in pelvic inflammatory disease is less well-defined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women#H11966268\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma genitalium infection in men and women&quot;, section on 'Pelvic inflammatory disease'</a>.)</p><p>In studies utilizing specialized techniques, anaerobic organisms were frequently recovered from the upper genital tract in women with acute PID. However, the importance of effective treatment of anaerobic organisms in women with acute PID is somewhat controversial and is currently under study (Clinical Trials.gov identifier NCT01160640) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rarely, actinomycetes may be isolated in the patient with an intrauterine device (IUD). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1024892\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple antibacterial agents with activity against the wide variety of implicated pathogens have been studied, including medications within the beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, lincosamide, and macrolide classes of drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Meta-analyses of selected trials have demonstrated overall clinical and microbiological cure rates of greater than 90 percent for most regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>]. </p><p>The vast majority of these studies have included dual therapy arms for coverage of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, <em>C. trachomatis</em>, and the wide variety of microbes associated with PID; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> has been the agent of choice for coverage of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in most of these studies, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> also has activity against this pathogen. The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> has moderate in vitro activity against <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em>, while a second generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a>) plus doxycycline have excellent in vitro activity against both pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ampicillin-sulbactam</a> is a beta-lactam agent with broad spectrum activity, although there are scant data on its use for the treatment of PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended in the United States for the treatment of gonorrhea or associated conditions, such as PID, due to increasing rates of resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1025375\" class=\"local\">'Gonococcal drug resistance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412704\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIAL DATA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412907\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining treatment response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment response is based on both short- and long-term outcomes. Clinical cure is defined as &quot;significant&quot; or &quot;complete improvement&quot; in the signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of PID. Microbiologic cure is defined as eradication of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> or <em>C. trachomatis</em>, if present at baseline. </p><p>Long-term sequelae of PID include infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412960\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of current data sets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple limitations of the clinical trials of PID treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1224669\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have not used objective criteria to diagnose PID, raising concerns as to the whether the appropriate patient population was included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, others have evaluated subjective improvement in pain scores without blinding of investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Few randomized controlled trials have long-term data on reproductive outcomes, such as risk of ectopic pregnancy following treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1224676\"><span class=\"h3\">Microbiologic efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although several studies have demonstrated the presence of anaerobes at initial presentation, there are scant data on their persistence or eradication after therapy. In fact, excellent clinical cure rates among women with mild to moderate PID have been documented for several regimens with modest anaerobic coverage (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>].</p><p>Assessment of efficacy is also hampered by diagnostic methods that do not distinguish between relapse versus reinfection. The Pelvic Inflammation Disease Evaluation Clinical Health trial (ie, PEACH trial), which carefully assessed patients for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> infections, demonstrated that 40 percent of the women had evidence of single or dual infections at baseline; by 30 days after therapeutic invention, approximately 3 percent still had evidence of either infection, representing either reinfection or relapse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412876\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of inpatient versus outpatient therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been a persistent trend toward outpatient treatment of PID with only 15 percent of women now being hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Clinical trial data support such an approach in patients with mild or moderate PID. The Pelvic Inflammation Disease Evaluation Clinical Health trial (ie, PEACH trial) randomly assigned 831 patients with mild or moderate PID to either [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> (2 grams every 6 hours) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg twice daily for 14 days)</p><p/><p>OR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outpatient therapy with a single intramuscular dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> (2 grams) plus a single dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a> (1 gram) plus oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg twice daily for 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p>Eligible women had a history of lower abdominal pain, uterine or adnexal tenderness on examination, and <span class=\"nowrap\">leukorrhea/mucopurulent</span> cervicitis or documented untreated gonococcal or chlamydial infection. Patients underwent a standardized interview, and cervical swabs were obtained for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Vaginal specimens were Gram stained and examined for evidence of bacterial vaginosis by a reference laboratory. Endometrial biopsies were scored for evidence of endometritis by two reference pathologists. Long-term follow-up was conducted through periodic phone calls. Intravenous therapy continued for a minimum of 48 hours; upon clinical improvement, the patient was switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for a 14-day course. </p><p>This clinical trial showed that short-term clinical and microbiologic outcomes and long-term reproductive outcomes (eg, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain) were similar between arms.

Antibiotics selected should have activity against <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, as both play a significant role in PID. As noted above, meta-analyses have demonstrated that a variety of antibiotics from multiple classes are all associated with clinical and microbiologic cure rates of greater than 90 percent. Cost, convenience of administration, safety, formulary availability and allergy history are all assessed in making antimicrobial selections. The choice of antimicrobial therapy is also guided by whether the patient will be treated as an inpatient or outpatient.

Up to 10 percent of women with untreated gonorrhea and 20 percent of women with untreated chlamydia infection may go on to develop PID. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute PID is caused by cervical microorganisms (including <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>) as well as the vaginal microflora, including enteric gram-negative rods, streptococci, genital mycoplasmas, and <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em>.

Meta-analyses of selected trials have demonstrated overall clinical and microbiological cure rates of greater than 90 percent for most regimens. Cost, convenience of administration, safety, allergy history, and drug resistance patterns are all assessed in making antimicrobial selections.
