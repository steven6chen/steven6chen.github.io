Symptoms typically continue to worsen for weeks to months before stabilizing. Severe disability with inability to walk or even sit unsupported, inability to write or feed oneself, and limited communication secondary to dysarthria are common, with some patients having a somewhat better outcome.</p><p>In some patients, PCD occurs along with other neurologic signs. As an example, when cerebellar degeneration occurs with encephalomyelitis, the underlying tumor is small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in approximately 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As noted above, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) can occur with PCD in patients with SCLC who have <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-P/Q</span> type calcium channel antibodies. Even patients with anti-Yo antibodies and relatively isolated PCD have detectable cognitive deficits approximately 20 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/20,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,53</a>].</p><p>Most patients (60 to 70 percent) with PCD do not have a cancer diagnosis at the onset of their neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/20,21,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15807258\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach to patients with PCD includes ruling out other diagnoses, confirming and characterizing the paraneoplastic syndrome, and identifying the underlying neoplasm, if this is not previously known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15807265\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia includes cerebellar and brainstem metastases, toxic and metabolic causes, and neurodegenerative causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Alcoholism, vitamin deficiency (thiamine, vitamin E, cobalamin), hypothyroidism, cerebrovascular disease, demyelination, infectious or postinfectious cerebellitis, Miller-Fisher syndrome, antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-associated cerebellar ataxia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), HIV, and celiac disease should be specifically considered. Medication lists should also be reviewed for possible contributors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic gait disorders of elderly people&quot;, section on 'Cerebellar ataxia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15807406\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic evaluation typically begins with neuroimaging and laboratory testing to exclude other conditions.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually not helpful for positive diagnosis of PCD but is important to exclude metastatic and cerebrovascular disease. In rare instances of PCD, contrast enhancement in the cerebellar folia can be found in acute phases of the disease, and positron emission tomography (PET) may reveal hypermetabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Diffuse cerebellar atrophy develops subsequently but is not sensitive early in the course of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/20,40,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,40,55</a>].</p><p>Laboratory testing may include thyroid function tests, vitamin levels, and other testing (anti-gliadin, anti-GAD antibodies, HIV serology) in the appropriate clinical setting.</p><p>As with other paraneoplastic syndromes involving the nervous system, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination can show inflammatory changes, at least in the early stages of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A mild pleocytosis (10 to 50 lymphocytes) and a mild elevation of protein are characteristic. Some patients with PCD or extensive encephalitis have the 14-3-3 protein characteristic of CJD in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. This might create some diagnostic confusion if a tumor is not evident because of symptom overlap between paraneoplastic disease and CJD. It is likely that the 14-3-3 protein in this setting reflects extensive central nervous system (CNS) damage rather than CJD. Immunoblotting reveals the 14-3-3 protein as a double band (similar to other false-positive results) rather than the single band in CJD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Paraneoplastic biomarkers should be sought in the patient's CSF and serum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 2</a>). Not all biomarkers have commercially available testing, and some antigens remain to be characterized. Thus, negative results do not exclude a paraneoplastic or autoimmune disorder. A sample of a patient's CSF and serum should be sent to a research laboratory for examination in these cases. Other caveats regarding antibody screening are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system&quot;, section on 'Antibody screening'</a>.)</p><p>If the patient does not have a known cancer diagnosis, evaluation for occult malignancy should also ensue. The presence of paraneoplastic biomarkers may help direct further evaluation if initial screening is negative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 2</a>). Tumors may be small; in some cases 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) or exploratory laparotomy were the only means of identifying the underlying lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/20,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,57</a>]. In a minority of patients with PCD, no tumor is identified despite vigorous investigations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/20,21,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,36</a>]. In such cases, serial investigations are advised.

Treatment of the underlying tumor is considered essential for neurologic stabilization; clinical improvement is less likely but can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/1,2,20,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,20,36</a>].</p><p>Immunotherapy is often used, but does not clearly affect neurologic outcome. In one larger case series, immunotherapy was not significantly associated with recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, there are anecdotal reports of neurologic improvement in patients tried on various immunologic therapies, including plasma exchange, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, given individually or in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/9,30,36,58-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,30,36,58-68</a>]. One literature review of 15 cases found that treatment with IVIG was more likely to be associated with a good outcome if it was administered within three months of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. There are also rare reports of spontaneous improvement. </p><p>Given the overall poor prognosis with substantial neurologic disability, a trial of immunotherapy seems reasonable. As most antibodies are directed against intracellular proteins, which implies cytotoxic T cell mechanisms, it is reasonable to focus the treatment on (1) controlling the cancer, and (2) controlling the cytotoxic T cell response. Towards this goal, we favor the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> over plasma exchange or IVIG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system&quot;, section on 'Treatment and prognosis overview'</a>.)</p><p>The type of antibody appears to affect neurologic prognosis. Patients with PCD associated with anti-Hu or anti-Yo antibodies are less likely to recover, while those with anti-Tr, anti-Ri, antimetabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1), or anti-CRMP5 antibodies may have a somewhat better chance of neurologic improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/2,12,32,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,32,70</a>]. In some reports, younger age and less severe disability at diagnosis and intervention appear to favorably affect prognosis.</p><p>Survival also varies with the type of associated antibody as well as the underlying neoplasm. In one series, survival was worse in patients with anti-Hu antibodies (median 7 months) and those with anti-Yo antibodies (median 13 months) compared with patients who had anti-Tr or anti-Ri antibodies (median survival 113 and 69 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In another series, median survival was 11 months in patients with anti-Hu antibodies compared with 48 months in those with anti-CV2 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Advanced age has a negative impact on survival. While some reports find that neurologic morbidity contributes most substantively to mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/20,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,36</a>], others have found that cancer progression was more important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration/abstract/21,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15807562\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is an uncommon disorder that can be associated with any cancer; the most commonly associated are lung cancer (particularly small cell lung cancer [SCLC]), gynecologic and breast cancer, and lymphoma (particularly Hodgkin disease [HD]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of autoantibodies associated with PCD have been characterized. Individual autoantibodies are often linked to specific cancer types <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 2</a>). As an example, patients with PCD and anti-Yo antibodies typically have breast or gynecologic cancer and isolated cerebellar deficits and pathology. Other antibodies along with their associated tumors and characteristic clinical features are outlined. (See <a href=\"#H15805935\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2924210475\" class=\"local\">'Associated antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PCD typically present with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, often beginning acutely, and followed several days later by gait instability and other cerebellar signs. Many patients with PCD develop cerebellar dysfunction along with other paraneoplastic neurologic disorders such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and encephalomyelitis. (See <a href=\"#H15807251\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are important to exclude other conditions; findings in PCD may be normal or nonspecifically abnormal. Paraneoplastic biomarkers provide supporting evidence for the diagnosis. If the patient does not have a known cancer diagnosis, evaluation for occult malignancy should ensue. (See <a href=\"#H15807258\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending on the type of underlying antibody and associated neoplasm, patients' neurologic symptoms may stabilize or rarely improve with antitumor treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunotherapy. As most antibodies are directed against intracellular proteins, which implies cytotoxic T cell mechanisms, we favor the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> over plasma exchange or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG).
