It has been theorized that paternal major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II antigens found on the chorionic villi&nbsp;induce maternal antibodies to the amniotic basement membrane.

The presence of C3 is pathognomonic for pemphigoid gestationis in a pregnant patient.

This test is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of pemphigoid gestationis, and its positivity can be considered diagnostic in patients with typical clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

DIF of perilesional skin showing linear C3 deposition along the dermoepidermal junction and the demonstration of circulating antibodies against BP180 NC16A by ELISA test will confirm the diagnosis of pemphigoid gestationis.

It typically presents during the third trimester but may occur earlier or in the immediate postpartum period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPP can occur anytime during pregnancy but typically presents in the third trimester of pregnancy with symmetric, erythematous plaques studded at the periphery with sterile pustules in a circinate pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110694\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110694 \">picture 13</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The plaques then enlarge from the periphery as the center becomes eroded and crusted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56769 \">picture 14B</a>). There may be concentric rings of pustules. The pustules are typically sterile.</p><p>The eruption begins in the flexural areas and spreads centrifugally. The trunk and extremities are usually involved, while the hands, feet, and face are usually spared. Oral and esophageal erosions may occur. The nails may become onycholytic (lifting of the nail plate from the nail bed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]; pitting has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Pruritus is usually absent. Systemic symptoms are severe and include malaise, fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and tetany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. </p><p>Leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are common. Hypocalcemia may be present, possibly related to hypoparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] and can lead to tetany, delirium, and seizures. Albuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, pyuria, and hematuria occasionally occur. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1243137981\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis can be made clinically, based upon history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79167%7EOBGYN%2F56769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79167 graphicRef56769 \">picture 14A-B</a>).

Spongiform pustules with neutrophils are observed in the epidermis. Psoriasiform hyperplasia and parakeratosis also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

The absence of a history of drug exposure helps in distinguishing PPP from AGEP.

Fetal monitoring with nonstress tests or biophysical profiles and ultrasound assessment of fetal growth are indicated. Hypocalcemia must be corrected, when present, and fluid and electrolyte balance should be maintained. These patients sometimes require early delivery for relief of symptoms and for fetal safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/68,69,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69,71</a>].</p><p>Evidence for the treatment of PPP is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. We suggest systemic corticosteroids as initial therapy. High-dose systemic corticosteroids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> up to 60 to 80 mg per day, are given for a few days and then slowly tapered as symptoms improve, with monitoring in case a flare occurs. </p><p>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) may be a treatment option for patients who fail to respond to systemic corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatoses-of-pregnancy/abstract/73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-76</a>]. Although cyclosporine is a category C drug, data from studies in pregnant patients with organ transplantation indicate that the risk of teratogenicity is low, but premature labor and infants small for gestational age have been reported.

They include pemphigoid gestationis, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP), previously known as pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), atopic eruption of pregnancy (AEP), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), and pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pregnant woman with a pruritic skin eruption requires immediate evaluation and diagnosis because delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis may pose significant risk to the fetus and the mother. The initial assessment is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69237\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69237 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1209229753\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the pregnant woman with a pruritic eruption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients suspected to have pemphigoid gestationis or pustular psoriasis should undergo skin biopsy with histopathologic assessment, direct immunofluorescence test, and measurement of circulating antibodies against anti-BP180 to confirm the clinical diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PEP and AEP, including prurigo of pregnancy and pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy, can be diagnosed clinically, based upon characteristic findings on history and physical examination alone. Bile acids should be checked in patients with extensive pruritus and no primary skin lesions. (See <a href=\"#H2077854605\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3813723899\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1323469443\" class=\"local\">'Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Treatment recommendations depend on the specific disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with pemphigoid gestationis, we suggest high-potency (group 2 and 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 4</a>)) topical corticosteroid ointments as initial treatment for localized disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We administer oral corticosteroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) if the symptoms are not controlled by topical therapy. Higher doses of oral corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive agents may be needed in patients with severe persistent postpartum pemphigoid gestationis.

Oral antihistamines may be helpful for the symptomatic treatment of pruritus.
