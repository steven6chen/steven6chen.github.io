Issues related to ifosfamide nephrotoxicity will be reviewed here. The nephrotoxicity of other chemotherapeutic agents is discussed separately.

This relationship could explain why <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, although structurally similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, has virtually no nephrotoxicity. At equivalent doses, the rate of chloroacetaldehyde generation with ifosfamide is much greater than with cyclophosphamide, although there is considerable variability from patient to patient in the amount of chloroacetaldehyde produced after ifosfamide administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other toxic metabolites specific to ifosfamide but not cyclophosphamide, such as isophosphoramide mustard, may contribute to nephrotoxicity, although in vitro studies have given conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. On the other hand, acrolein is believed to be the major cause of the bladder toxicity (hemorrhagic cystitis) seen with both ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide.</p><p>Cellular oxidative stress may be the mechanism of injury, leading to energy depletion via mitochondrial damage, a mechanism similar to that observed with the mitochondrial cytopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Disruption of cell membrane function is another possible mechanism of toxicity.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mesna</a>, which is used concurrently with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> to prevent bladder toxicity, might also be expected to reduce renal damage due to chloroacetaldehyde or other nephrotoxic metabolites of ifosfamide. However, mesna has a complex intrarenal pharmacology and association with intratubular glutathione. Thus, it has not been possible to demonstrate a clear role for mesna in prevention of ifosfamide nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ifosfamide-induced renal injury is primarily manifested by the onset of one or more of the following signs of tubular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypophosphatemia induced by decreased proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption, which can lead to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/6-10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment in proximal tubular function (Fanconi syndrome) as manifested by renal glucosuria, bicarbonaturia, aminoaciduria, tubular proteinuria (demonstrated by a marked increase in urinary excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins such as beta-2-microglobulin, but not of albumin), and potassium wasting (which may cause severe hypokalemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,6-8,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-8,10-12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) acidosis due to type 1 (distal) or type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ie, resistance to antidiuretic hormone), which appears to be relatively rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7,9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,12,13</a>]; when polyuria does occur, it is more often an appropriate response to isotonic saline hydration therapy given during chemotherapy administration. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology of polyuria'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The time of onset of tubular dysfunction is variable. In a report of 27 patients with manifestations of tubular dysfunction, the diagnosis was made during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> therapy in 9 patients and after the cessation of therapy in 18 patients at a median of 13 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In addition to tubular dysfunction, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> therapy can lead to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In most patients, the decline in GFR is mild (usually no more than 20 to 30 percent below the baseline level) unless ifosfamide is given in combination with another nephrotoxin such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7,8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Long-term prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> nephrotoxicity are different from the major manifestations of nephrotoxicity induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>. Cisplatin primarily affects the S3 segment of the proximal tubule and the distal nephron, leading to acute kidney injury and hypomagnesemia due to urinary magnesium wasting. Glucosuria and aminoaciduria can occasionally occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cisplatin nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology of polyuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted in the preceding section, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> can induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, it is an uncommon complication that typically occurs in patients who have other signs of tubular toxicity, such as glucosuria, aminoaciduria, and hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ifosfamide-nephrotoxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A more frequent problem is the marked polyuria that may complicate the administration of high-dose ifosfamide-based chemotherapy protocols. The cause of the polyuria in almost all such cases is a sodium diuresis (not a dilute water diuresis as in diabetes insipidus) that results from the volume expansion induced by saline therapy given to maintain a high urine output during chemotherapy administration, particularly if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> is part of the regimen. Thus, the diuresis is <strong>appropriate</strong> and resolves if sodium intake is reduced and excretion of the excess fluid is permitted. In addition, the urine osmolality tends to be similar to that of plasma, not dilute as in diabetes insipidus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Solute diuresis'</a>.)</p><p>A confounding factor is the presence of orthostatic (postural) hypotension. Although this finding may suggest possible volume depletion, it may also be due to chemotherapy-induced autonomic neuropathy. Volume expansion may minimize orthostasis by maximizing the intravascular volume, but it also leads to persistence of the polyuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> nephrotoxicity are cumulative dose, age under four to five years, and prior or concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> therapy.

No patients had severe nephrotoxicity. No patient required long-term treatment with bicarbonate, phosphate, calcium, or vitamin D. In multivariate analysis, the length of follow-up and older age at diagnosis were independent predictors of a reduction in GFR.

The mean estimated GFR fell from 82 to 67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> after five years; most of this reduction occurred during the course of chemotherapy (likely reflecting acute kidney injury), although renal function continued to decline thereafter.

Nephrotoxicity due to direct tubular injury is a prominent complication of ifosfamide therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal injury is manifested by signs of tubular dysfunction including glucosuria, aminoaciduria, tubular proteinuria (ie, increased urine excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins such as beta-2-microglobulin, but not of albumin), and rarely, polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients may have hypophosphatemia due to decreased proximal phosphate reabsorption, hypokalemia due to potassium wasting, and a normal anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to tubular dysfunction, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> can lead to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The reduction in GFR is generally mild unless ifosfamide is given in combination with another nephrotoxin such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> nephrotoxicity include cumulative dose, age under four to five years, prior nephrectomy (and probably other causes of renal dysfunction), and prior or concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> therapy. Clinically significant nephrotoxicity is more likely to occur at a total dose above 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> and severe nephrotoxicity above 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span>. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cornerstone of prevention of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> nephrotoxicity is to limit the cumulative dose. Other modalities, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesna</a> and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), have not been proven to be effective. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited studies suggest that the long-term prognosis of moderate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> nephrotoxicity is good with the majority of patients recovering normal tubular function and GFR during the first 10 years after completing treatment.
