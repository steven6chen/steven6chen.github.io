However, the disorder that causes hyperthyroidism may have other effects. In particular, Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, causes unique problems that are not related to the high serum thyroid hormone concentrations. These include Graves' ophthalmopathy and infiltrative dermopathy (localized or pretibial myxedema). Most patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism have a diffuse goiter, but so do patients with other, less common causes of hyperthyroidism such as painless thyroiditis and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-secreting pituitary tumors.</p><p>The major clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) will be briefly reviewed here. More detailed discussions of its effects on specific organ systems, as well as the diagnostic approach to patients with hyperthyroidism, are discussed separately.

The most common site is the skin overlying the shins, where it presents as raised, hyperpigmented, violaceous, orange-peel-textured papules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretibial myxedema (thyroid dermopathy) in autoimmune thyroid disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EYES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stare and lid lag occur in all patients with hyperthyroidism. They are due to sympathetic overactivity, possibly mediated by increased alpha-adrenergic receptors in some tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Lid lag is evaluated by having the patient follow the examiner's finger as it is moved up and down. The patient has lid lag if sclera can be seen above the iris as the patient looks downward.</p><p>As noted above, only patients with Graves' disease have ophthalmopathy. It is characterized by inflammation of the extraocular muscles and orbital fat and connective tissue, which results in proptosis (exophthalmos), impairment of eye muscle function, and periorbital and conjunctival edema. Ophthalmopathy is more common in patients who smoke cigarettes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with ophthalmopathy may have gritty feeling or pain in their eyes, and they may have diplopia due to extraocular muscle dysfunction. Corneal ulceration can occur as a result of proptosis and lid retraction, and severe proptosis can cause optic neuropathy and even blindness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hyperthyroidism have an increase in cardiac output, due both to increased peripheral oxygen needs and increased cardiac contractility. Heart rate is increased, pulse pressure is widened, and peripheral vascular resistance is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Systolic hypertension is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The left ventricular ejection fraction does not increase appropriately during exercise, suggesting the presence of a true cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. High- or normal-output congestive heart failure can occur in patients with severe hyperthyroidism, and congestive heart failure worsens in patients who already have it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Atrial fibrillation occurs in 10 to 20 percent of patients with hyperthyroidism, and it is more common in older patients. In one study, 8 percent of all patients and 15 percent of patients between ages 70 to 79 developed atrial fibrillation within 30 days of the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Even subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased rate of atrial ectopy and a threefold increased risk of atrial fibrillation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55024 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In 60 percent of hyperthyroid patients with atrial fibrillation, the rhythm converts spontaneously to sinus rhythm when the hyperthyroidism is treated; in one study, all who spontaneously converted did so within four months after becoming euthyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among those who do not convert spontaneously to sinus rhythm and who undergo successful electrical cardioversion, the two-year risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation was 59 percent compared with 83 percent of patients whose atrial fibrillation was not associated with hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Anticoagulation should be considered in hyperthyroid patients with atrial fibrillation. In several studies, 10 to 40 percent of patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation had an arterial embolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Left atrial enlargement, which is a risk factor for thrombus formation, is present in approximately 90 percent of hyperthyroid patients with atrial fibrillation and 2 percent of hyperthyroid patients with sinus rhythm. Based on these results, we usually anticoagulate hyperthyroid patients with atrial fibrillation. The role of anticoagulant therapy in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>Other abnormalities, including mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation, and an increase in left ventricular mass index have also been reported.

It is associated with both increased sensitivity of pancreatic beta cells to glucose, resulting in increased insulin secretion, and antagonism to the peripheral action of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The latter effect usually predominates, leading to impaired glucose tolerance in untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpretation of the cortisol response to corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation testing may be misleading in patients with hyperthyroidism because cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) levels decrease, resulting in lower total serum cortisol concentrations. In one report of 49 hyperthyroid patients undergoing ACTH testing, 35 percent had subnormal total serum cortisol values (&lt;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL),</span> while only 11 percent had a subnormal free cortisol index (ratio of serum total cortisol to CBG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyspnea and dyspnea on exertion may occur for many reasons in hyperthyroidism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-function-in-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory function in thyroid disease&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production increase.

Most patients have hyperphagia, but an occasional patient with mild hyperthyroidism may have sufficient appetite stimulation that weight is gained (more commonly in younger patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Thymic enlargement is usually discovered incidentally during the evaluation of other symptoms, such as dyspnea. The pathogenetic mechanism is unclear, but it is not a feature of hyperthyroidism due to causes other than Graves' disease. Potential mechanisms include autoimmune mediated (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins from patients with Graves' disease bind to the thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] receptor in the human thymus and cause thymocyte proliferation) and hyperthyroidism mediated (hyperthyroidism-induced angiogenesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>]. Causes of thymic enlargement other than Graves' disease should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most patients, treatment of Graves' disease with antithyroid medications, radioiodine, or thyroidectomy results in involution of thymic hyperplasia over 4 to 25 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, coexisting malignancies have been reported, and therefore, repeat imaging three to four months after initiation of therapy is warranted to ensure regression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOLOGIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The red blood cell mass is increased in hyperthyroidism, but the plasma volume is increased more, resulting in a normochromic, normocytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Serum ferritin concentrations may be high.</p><p>Graves' hyperthyroidism may be associated with autoimmune hematologic disorders such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and pernicious anemia, and some patients have antineutrophil antibodies.</p><p>Hyperthyroidism may also be prothrombotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. As an example, in a meta-analysis of 51 studies evaluating the effect of thyroid hormone excess (exogenous or endogenous) on the coagulation system, excess thyroid hormone was associated with a rise in prothrombotic factors, including factors VIII, IX, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Possible causes include primary polydipsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and hypercalciuria. Enuresis is common in children.</p><p>In women, serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations are high, which results in high serum estradiol concentrations and low-normal serum free (unbound) estradiol concentrations, high serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, a reduced mid-cycle surge in LH secretion, oligomenorrhea, and anovulatory infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Amenorrhea can occur in women with severe hyperthyroidism.</p><p>In men, the increase in serum SHBG concentrations results in high serum total testosterone concentrations, but serum free (unbound) testosterone concentrations are normal or low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Serum LH concentrations may be slightly high. Extragonadal conversion of testosterone to estradiol is increased, so that serum estradiol concentrations are high. These changes can cause gynecomastia, reduced libido, and erectile dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/33,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,37</a>]. Spermatogenesis is often decreased or abnormal, eg, more spermatozoa are abnormal or nonmotile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid hormone stimulates bone resorption, resulting in increased porosity of cortical bone and reduced volume of trabecular bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The loss in cortical bone density is greater than that of trabecular bone. Serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin concentrations are high, indicative of increased bone turnover. The increase in bone resorption may lead to an increase in serum calcium concentrations, thereby inhibiting parathyroid hormone secretion and the conversion of calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). In addition, the metabolic clearance rate of calcitriol is increased. These changes can result in impaired calcium absorption and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. The net effect is osteoporosis and an increased fracture risk in patients with chronic hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Patients with thyroid acropachy commonly present with asymptomatic clubbing, severe ophthalmopathy, and dermopathy; a high percentage is cigarette smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROPSYCHIATRIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with thyrotoxicosis may experience behavioral and personality changes, such as psychosis, agitation, and depression.

However, the disorder that causes hyperthyroidism may have other effects. In particular, Graves' disease causes unique problems that are not related to the high serum thyroid hormone concentrations. These include Graves' ophthalmopathy and infiltrative dermopathy (localized or pretibial myxedema).
