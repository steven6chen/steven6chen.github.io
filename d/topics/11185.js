Most head trauma in children is minor and not associated with brain injury or long-term sequelae. However, a small number of children who appear to be at low risk may have a clinically important traumatic brain (ciTBI) injury.</p><p>The clinical challenge for evaluating minor head trauma in pediatric patients is to identify those infants and children with ciTBI while limiting unnecessary radiographic imaging and radiation exposure. Neuroimaging, usually with computed tomography (CT), is highly sensitive for identifying brain injury requiring acute intervention. However, individual clinical predictors for ciTBI are often nonspecific, particularly in young children. Thus, evaluation for high risk findings and the use of a clinical decision rule can provide a balanced approach that identifies almost all infants and children with ciTBI after minor head trauma without overuse of CT. Most infants and children with minor head trauma can be safely discharged home after careful evaluation without undergoing imaging. If neuroimaging is performed, those patients with normal clinical findings and imaging may also be discharged home.</p><p>The management of infants and children with mild head trauma is presented here. </p><p>The clinical features of head-injured children with and without brain injury and the evaluation of minor head trauma in children, concussion and mild head trauma in adolescents, severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and adolescents, and abusive head trauma in children are reviewed separately: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sideline-evaluation-of-concussion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sideline evaluation of concussion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12673558\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12673565\"><span class=\"h2\">Minor head trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the difference in mechanisms and presentations, it is best to define minor head trauma differently by age as follows (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Mechanism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Incidence of brain injury'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children younger than two years of age</strong> &ndash; Minor head trauma is generally defined separately in children younger than two years of age for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinical assessment is more difficult</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants with intracranial injuries are frequently asymptomatic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skull fractures or clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) may occur despite minor trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inflicted injury occurs more frequently</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Experts define minor head trauma in these patients as a history or physical signs of blunt trauma to the scalp, skull, or brain in an infant or child who is alert or awakens to voice or light touch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children two years of age and older</strong> &ndash; The definition of minor head trauma for children two years of age and older has often been based upon the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

Observation is still important even in discharged patients because signs and symptoms of traumatic brain injury may arise and prompt return to the ED for reevaluation. Thus, clear instructions should be provided and the presence of responsible caretakers who can return in timely manner, if necessary, should be assured. The clinician should also determine, based upon the clinical scenario (eg, age and symptoms of child, time since injury, time of day, home distance from hospital, and perceived quality of caregiver observation), whether emergency department or hospital observation is necessary and, if it is necessary, how long observation should last.

All such patients should meet discharge criteria.

As an example, the risk of ciTBI in infants and children who meet criteria for very low risk of ciTBI by the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477 \">table 2</a>) is approximately 0.5 to 3 per 1000.

(See <a href=\"#H7311447\" class=\"local\">'Discharge criteria'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Limited evidence suggests that rapid clinical improvement over a few hours is associated with a risk that is &lt;1 percent, making discharge a safe approach.

As an example, in an observational study of 17,962 children evaluated in an emergency department for uncomplicated minor head injuries with or without head CT, the estimated incidences of delayed diagnosis (&gt;6 hours) of an intracranial injury with and without deterioration in level of consciousness were 0.14 and 0.57 cases per 100,000 children per year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, infants and children with more than one intermediate risk factor or worsening of symptoms with time warrant neuroimaging and management according to radiographic findings.

However, most children with skull fractures and normal neuroimaging can be safely discharged home.

As an example, in a multicenter observational study of 13,543 children who were evaluated in children&rsquo;s hospital emergency departments for isolated minor head trauma (Glasgow coma scale 14 or 15) and who had normal cranial computed tomography (CT) scan results, repeat neuroimaging (CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) was performed in 2 percent of 11,058 discharged patients and 6 percent of admitted patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].
