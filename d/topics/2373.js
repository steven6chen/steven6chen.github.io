The diagnosis and management of burn wound infection remains challenging due to the many physiologic features unique to burn injury. A variety of factors increase the risk of developing burn wound infection, and individuals who sustain a severe burn have a particularly high risk for burn wound sepsis. </p><p>Any rapid change in the burn wound appearance or the clinical condition of the burn patient may herald burn wound infection or sepsis. The different categories of burn wound infection are characterized based on clinical features and depth of invasion, which is determined through cultures and histopathology of tissue obtained by burn wound biopsy. A diagnosis of burn wound infection relies on the demonstration of &gt;10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per gram tissue (or recovery of mold or yeast by culture). Specific criteria that include the presence of microbial invasion into adjacent normal tissue, among other criteria, have been suggested by the American Burn Association (ABA) to define burn wound sepsis. </p><p>The most common organisms remain <em>Staphylococcus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em>; however, the epidemiology of burn wound infections has changed with time and also depends on geography. It is imperative to be aware of the flora and susceptibility of organisms in each burn unit to be able to treat burn wound infections effectively. </p><p>Depending upon the burn wound category, treatment of burn wound <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/sepsis</span> consists of a combination of wound cleansing, debridement, topical or systemic antimicrobial therapy, and burn wound debridement or excision.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of burn wound infection and sepsis are reviewed here. Sepsis related to other conditions is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1149365887\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of burn wound sepsis has declined from 6 to 1 percent since the practice of early burn wound excision; however, for patients with total body surface area (TBSA) burns &gt;15 percent, the rate has remained the same [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The highest rates of surgical burn wound infections occur in the lower extremities, but specific organisms or classes of organisms are not confined to one particular anatomic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Patients with burn wounds also have high rates of other types of infection, such as catheter-related infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In a series of 175 patients with severe burns, infections preceded multiorgan dysfunction in 83 percent of patients and were considered the direct cause of death in 36 percent of those who died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1149358735\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of factors increase the risk of developing invasive burn wound infection (burn wound sepsis). Individuals who sustain a TBSA burn &gt;20 percent are at particularly high risk; however, burn wound infection and sepsis can occur in smaller burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-8</a>]. Other risk factors include delays in burn wound excision, extremes in age (very old, very young), and impaired immunity. Microbial factors, such as type and number of organisms, enzyme and toxin production, and motility, also contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/4,9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-13</a>]. But it is important to remember that burn wound infection and sepsis can occur in smaller burns. </p><p>In the management of burn wounds, topical therapy is associated with a higher incidence of burn wound infection and graft loss compared with early excision and grafting. Delaying burn wound excision increases bacterial loads and gram-negative colonization. When bacterial counts exceed 10<sup>5</sup> organisms per gram of tissue in the burn eschar, wounds should be considered at risk for developing invasive burn wound infections, even when the wounds are excised. Despite the ability of burn wound excision to decrease bacterial counts, burn wounds with high counts are at risk of developing burn wound sepsis both before and after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1149367493\" class=\"local\">'Wound colonization'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363410983\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burn injury is associated with profound alterations in metabolic and host defense mechanisms and immune function, which predisposes burn patients to local and systemic invasion by microbial pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. The burn wound is also susceptible to opportunistic colonization by endogenous and exogenous organisms. Colonization of burn wounds by endogenous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exogenous organisms often occur as biofilms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The spectrum of microorganisms causing infection in burn patients varies not only with geographical location but also has changed with time, and, thus, it is necessary to review the bacterial flora colonizing burn patients on a regular basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1149367493\" class=\"local\">'Wound colonization'</a> below.)</p><p>An intact, healthy skin surface has bacteriostatic properties that normally limit the degree of skin colonization by pathogens and noninvasive resident microbes. Low levels of bacteria that colonize the burn wound stimulate the inflammatory response, activate macrophages, and produce growth factors and cytokines that aid in wound healing. They also prevent overgrowth of nonresident bacteria. (See <a href=\"#H369655027\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Burned patients lose their protective primary barrier (skin) to environmental microorganisms. The burn also consists of avascular necrotic tissue (eschar) that provides a protein-rich environment favorable to microbial colonization and proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/9,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,14</a>]. The avascularity of the eschar impairs migration of host immune cells and restricts delivery of systemically administered antimicrobial agents, while toxic substances released by eschar tissue impair local host immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369655027\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spectrum of microorganisms causing infections in burn patients varies with time and location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83410 \">table 1</a>). The organisms causing burn wound infection typically appear at varying stages post-burn-injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83410 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Immediately after burning, the microbial population of the burn wound is sparse and includes predominantly gram-positive bacteria that survived the thermal insult, such as staphylococci located deep within sweat glands and hair follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. Within the first week post-burn, burn wounds are colonized with other microbes, such as gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts derived from the patient's normal gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract flora, and from the hospital environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/4,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-11</a>]. The predominant gram-positive organisms found in burn wound infections remain <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, followed by <em>Enterococcus</em> species, which are found in decreasing numbers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83410 \">table 1</a>). Gram-negative pathogens dominate after the fifth day of a typically protracted in-hospital stay and have emerged as the most common etiologic agents of invasive infection by virtue of their large repertoire of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance traits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24</a>]. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> remains the most frequent gram-negative microorganism isolated from burn wounds, followed by <em>E. coli</em>.</p><p>With severe burn-associated immune deficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed or inadequate treatment, microbial invasion of viable tissue occurs, which represents the hallmark of an invasive burn wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Fungi (eg, <em>Candida</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Fusarium</em>, <em>Mucor </em>species) and multiresistant organisms (eg, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA], vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> [VRE], <em>Acinetobacter</em>) appear late in chronological appearance and typically occur after use of broad-spectrum antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a prolonged hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <em>Candida sp.</em> is the most common fungus isolated from burn wounds and the fourth most common cause of burn wound infections overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and HSV-1 remains the most common viral organism in burn wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The characteristic physical findings of these common organisms are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83411 \">table 2</a>). Emerging multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria and fungi have caused an unanticipated rise in burn wound infections, sepsis, and associated death worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/7,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25-28</a>]. In recent years, infections with MRSA, <em>S. maltophilia</em>, and <em>Acinetobacter sp. </em>have become more frequent and increasingly more difficult to treat as these species are becoming more often resistant to the antibiotics traditionally used to treat them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Patients who had previously tolerated enteral feedings may show signs of intolerance (eg, abdominal distention, increase in residual volume two times the feeding rate in adults and &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> in children, uncontrollable diarrhea &gt;2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> for adults and &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> for children).

The most common clinical feature is a rapid change in the appearance of the wound, which may include conversion of a partial-thickness injury to full-thickness injury, or loss of previously viable tissue or skin graft. </p><p>Acute bacterial infection manifests with the development of discoloration, pain, purulent exudate, edema, tenderness, swelling, drainage, or malodor from a burn or burn-related wound (previously reepithelialized grafted burn site, skin donor site). The appearance of infection may involve only a portion of the burn wound. A surrounding cellulitis can occur and is characterized by erythema involving uninjured skin and may also exhibit localized pain and tenderness, swelling, and warmth. Infection may also lead to ischemia, necrosis, or loss of synthetic or biologic covering. </p><p>Local signs and characteristics of burn wound infections caused by fungi include unexpectedly rapid separation of the eschar, presumably due to fat liquefaction, and rapid spread of subcutaneous edema with central ischemic necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83411 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Vesicular lesions that appear in healing or healed second-degree burns and the presence of crusted serrated margins of partial-thickness burns of the face, particularly those involving the nasolabial area, are characteristic of burn wound infections caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The most reliable local sign of invasive burn wound infection (burn wound sepsis) is conversion of an area of partial-thickness injury to full-thickness necrosis, or the necrosis of previously viable tissue in an excised wound bed or skin graft. Such necrosis appears as focal, multifocal, or generalized dark brown, black, or violaceous discoloration of the wound or graft, or as overt sloughing of a previously adherent graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Other characteristics of invasive burn wound infection include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/4,9-11,29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-11,29,31</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> violaceous discoloration at the margin of the burn <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unburned skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhagic discoloration of subeschar tissue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separation or discoloration of the burn eschar</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of green pigment (pyocyanin) in subcutaneous fat (indicative of Pseudomonas infection)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of initially erythematous and later black necrotic nodular lesions (ecthyma gangrenosa) in adjacent unburned skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exophthalmos may be the first sign of mucormycosis in midface burns (retrobulbar space involvement)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1149372602\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severely burned patients lose their primary barrier to invasion by microorganisms, and, as such, they are constantly exposed to the external environment.

The tissue biopsy samples should be obtained from several of the affected areas of the burn wound and should be approximately 1 to 2 cm in length and 1.5 cm deep and extend into the subcutaneous tissue, or weigh approximately 0.5 grams. Although a presumptive diagnosis of infection can be made when bacterial count is &gt;10<sup>5</sup> organisms per gram of tissue, quantitative cultures are more helpful for confirming the absence of wound infection (&lt;10<sup>5</sup> organisms per gram of tissue).

Early excision of necrotic tissue and closure of the burn wound has been one of the single greatest advancements in the treatment of patients with severe thermal injuries and a mainstay of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries#H22158166\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;, section on 'Skin grafting'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;, section on 'Early excision and grafting'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85983200\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. Although the overall incidence of burn wound sepsis has declined, the incidence of burn wound infection among those with total body surface area (TBSA) burn &gt;15 percent has remained approximately 6 percent. Patients with burn wounds also have high rates of other types of infection, such as catheter-related infection. (See <a href=\"#H1149365887\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of factors increase the risk of developing invasive burn wound infection (burn wound sepsis). Individuals who sustain a TBSA burn &gt;20 percent are at particularly high risk; however, burn wound infection and sepsis can occur in smaller burns. Other factors include delays in burn wound excision, extremes in age (very old, very young), and impaired immunity. Microbial factors, such as type, virulence, and bacterial count (&gt;10<sup>5</sup> organisms per gram of tissue), increase the risk of an invasive wound infection. (See <a href=\"#H1149358735\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organisms that can colonize the burn wound and potentially give rise to burn wound infection vary with time and location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83410 \">table 1</a>). We routinely swab burn wounds for culture at the time of admission, weekly, and again if there are any concerning changes in appearance or the clinical condition of the patient. The most common organisms are <em>Staphylococcus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em>; however, the epidemiology of burn wound infections changes over time and also depends on the specific burn unit. A bacterial burden &gt;10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per gram of tissue results in impaired skin graft take and promotes systemic infection. (See <a href=\"#H363410983\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recognition of burn wound infection remains challenging due to the many features unique to a burn injury. A rapid change in the clinical condition of the burn patient, such as increasing pain or changes in the gross appearance of a burn wound or skin graft donor sites; intolerance of enteral feedings; or systemic signs, is indicative of burn wound infection and potentially burn wound sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H192005881\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When wound infection is suspected clinically based upon clinical features, quantitative wound cultures and examination of histopathology obtained by biopsying the wound are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of burn wound infection (&gt;10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per gram of tissue), which may or may not be invasive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101841\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101841 \">algorithm 1</a>). The categories of burn wound infection are characterized based upon clinical features and depth of invasion. (See <a href=\"#H1149367493\" class=\"local\">'Wound colonization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1149374419\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most laboratory studies are nonspecific. Serum procalcitonin may differentiate bacterial infection from noninfective causes of fever; however, a specific cutoff value is difficult to define; trends may be more useful. (See <a href=\"#H1149360352\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Criteria used for a diagnosis of sepsis in unburned patients often does not apply in burn patients, particularly severely burned patients, due to alterations of the patient's metabolic profile by inflammatory mediators. The burn sepsis definition distinguishes physiologic changes that occur secondary to the hypermetabolic response of the burn itself from those that result from microbial infection. Specific criteria have been suggested by the American Burn Association. (See <a href=\"#H372573431\" class=\"local\">'American Burn Association criteria for burn wound sepsis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have clinical changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic signs concerning for burn wound infection or sepsis, we biopsy the burn wounds typically during the operative excision of any necrotic or infected tissue. (See <a href=\"#H372573676\" class=\"local\">'Tissue biopsy and histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the burn wound category, treatment of burn wound infection consists of a combination of burn wound care (ie, cleansing, dressings), topical antimicrobial therapy, systemic antimicrobial therapy, and burn wound debridement or excision. (See <a href=\"#H1149366265\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Noninvasive burn wound infection is characterized by typical clinical features of burn wound infection without systemic signs, bacterial count &gt;10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per gram of tissue (or recovery of mold or yeast by culture), and no microbial invasion into unburned tissue. Treatment consists primarily of topical antimicrobial therapy and burn wound excision for unexcised wounds, and possibly reexcision for excised wounds. (See <a href=\"#H1149374419\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Invasive burn wound infection is characterized by typical clinical features of burn wound infection <strong>and</strong> systemic signs, bacterial count &gt;10<sup>5</sup> bacteria per gram of tissue obtained from a burn wound or eschar, <strong>and</strong> microbial invasion into unburned tissue. Treatment is initiated with systemic broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and excision of all infected tissue to healthy tissue bed as determined by intraoperative biopsy. Specific antimicrobial therapy is guided by the results of burn wound culture and histopathology. (See <a href=\"#H372573503\" class=\"local\">'Invasive infection'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">S&oslash;rensen B, Fisker NP, Steensen JP, Kalaja E.
