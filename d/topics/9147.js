Health care professionals, including clinicians, nurses, and registered dietitians, should promote this approach. However, in most instances, lifestyle interventions alone do not achieve or maintain weight loss and metabolic targets.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> should usually be prescribed concurrently with lifestyle intervention in the treatment of the patient with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is the agent of choice because it reduces glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values by approximately 1.5 percent, facilitates the achievement of mild weight loss, has a low incidence of gastrointestinal side effects when given with meals, and is inexpensive when generic formulations are prescribed. This agent should be given with meals, started at low doses, eg, 500 mg by mouth once or twice daily, and then increased as tolerated to a full dose of 2000 to 2500 mg a day in divided doses with meals. Metformin acts by decreasing hepatic glucose output.
