They have higher morbidity and mortality rates than term infants (gestational age &ge;37 weeks) due to their relative physiologic and metabolic immaturity, even though they are often the size and weight of some term infants. </p><p>The epidemiology, outcomes, and management of late preterm infants will be reviewed here.</p><p>The views reported in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is well established that gestational age has a major impact upon clinical outcome. Thus, it is necessary to standardize medical terminology related to neonatal maturation by gestational age rather than birth weight so that gestational age-appropriate care can be administered, and data from different studies can be compared.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm birth &ndash; The World Health Organization (WHO), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) define preterm birth as the delivery of an infant before completion of 37 weeks gestation. This occurs on or before the 259<sup>th</sup> day after the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) of the mother.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) generally reports data on three categories of preterm birth: overall preterm (&lt;37 weeks gestation), moderately preterm (between 32 and 36 weeks gestation), and very preterm births (&lt;32 weeks gestation). By convention, only completed weeks of gestation are reported. Thus, infants born five days after completing 35 weeks are reported as 35 weeks gestation, and are not rounded up to 36 weeks gestation. If a more precise gestational age is desired, a superscript to specify the number of days after the completed week of gestation is usually used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the 2014 data year, NCHS transitioned to a new standard for estimating the gestational age of the newborn. The obstetric estimate of gestation at delivery (OE) is now the measurement used rather than the date of LMP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Gestational age estimates differ somewhat for OE versus LMP-based measures.

Late preterm has replaced near term to describe this group of infants, since near term incorrectly implies that these infants are &quot;almost term&quot; and only require routine neonatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early term infants &ndash; Early term infants are born between 37 and 38 <span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</span> weeks gestation. These infants appear to have less favorable outcomes than infants born between 39 and 40 weeks gestation and initiatives have been taken to limit elective delivery before 39 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preterm deliveries occur as a result of spontaneous preterm labor, including cases when premature rupture of membranes precedes the onset of labor, or medical interventions (ie, labor induction or cesarean delivery) that are initiated to reduce poor outcome associated with specific maternal or fetal conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74561\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74561 \">table 1</a>). The overall rate of preterm births in the United States is approximately 10 percent, of which 70 percent are born late preterm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61972 \">table 2</a>). Risk factors for the delivery of preterm infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68992 \">table 3</a>) are similar for the three different categories of preterm infants (ie, late preterm births [34 and 36 weeks gestation], births between 32 and 33 weeks gestation, and very preterm infants [&lt;32 weeks gestation]), and are discussed in greater detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;</a>). However, in one study based upon data from the British Columbia Perinatal Database Registry, maternal risk factors that were more common in late preterm (defined as 33 to 36 weeks gestation) compared with term infants included chorioamnionitis, hypertension, diabetes, thrombophilia, premature rupture of membranes, primigravida, and teenage pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors associated with increased late preterm birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that contribute to late preterm births include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetrical surveillance that detect maternal, placental, and fetal conditions, which result in medically indicated births (ie, induction of labor or cesarean delivery), as these disorders would result in worse outcomes if pregnancy was allowed to continue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants/abstract/3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7</a>].

Women who are overweight or obese are more likely to have a preterm delivery than nonobese women due to obesity-related medical and antenatal complications (eg, maternal diabetes and hypertension, and multifetal pregnancy), which may lead to delivery interventions rather than an intrinsic predisposition to spontaneous preterm birth.

The observed joint morbidity rates for late preterm infants were higher than the expected additive effect for each maternal condition, except for maternal infection.

Respiratory morbidity increases with decreasing gestational age as illustrated by a retrospective report from the Consortium on Safe Labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Data from 12 participating clinical centers across the United States were collected from medical records of 233,844 deliveries from 2002 and 2008 including 19,334 late preterm births.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Birth hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Readmission rates are two to three times greater for late preterm compared with term infants. Early readmission (within 15 days of discharge from birth hospitalization) includes hyperbilirubinemia, feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, dehydration, and apnea. Many of these readmissions can be prevented by careful monitoring; early establishment of maternal milk production, with supplementation in addition to direct feeding at breast; and support for families to provide appropriate home care after discharge. During the first year of life, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders are the most common diagnoses for late readmission. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Post-birth discharge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late preterm infants appear to be at increased risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairment compared with term infants. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Neurodevelopmental outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infant mortality rate for late preterm infants is at least threefold greater than that of term infants. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with late preterm infants include prevention of late preterm delivery, successful establishment and support of milk production and breastfeeding, and management to prevent and treat the associated complications of late preterm birth during birth hospitalization and post-birth discharge. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Martin JA, Osterman MJ, Kirmeyer SE, Gregory EC.
