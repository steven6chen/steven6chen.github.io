Drugs that may have direct hepatotoxicity also should be used cautiously.</p><p>Symptomatic newborns with hyperammonemia should be cared for in a center with established experience in the diagnosis and treatment of metabolic disorders, including hemodialysis. Optimally, care should be directed by a biochemical geneticist experienced in the management of inborn errors of metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic patients typically are volume depleted because of a history of poor feeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent vomiting. Reduced tissue perfusion can further increase protein catabolism and nitrogen load and lead to increased ammonia concentrations. In addition, pharmacologic treatment of UCDs requires good renal function. Thus, repletion of intravascular fluid is a priority. However, the fluid infusion rate should be adjusted carefully because overhydration may worsen the intracellular cerebral edema caused by hyperammonemia.</p><p>Intravenous access, preferably via a central catheter, should be established for blood sampling and for the administration of fluids and medications. Standard bolus infusion with normal saline is appropriate in the emergent scenario in patients with acute hypovolemia. Saline infusion subsequent to acute fluid resuscitation should be minimized because of the high saline content of nitrogen scavenging medications. Instead, intravenous fluids should consist of 10 percent dextrose in water, although significant and prolonged hyperglycemia should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">AMMONIA REMOVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive ammonia is removed by hemodialysis and medications. Hemodialysis is the quickest and most efficient method and should be used if ammonia is rapidly increasing, the acute hyperammonemia is resistant to initial drug therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the ammonia is persistently above the range of 350 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Newborns with acute (less than 24 to 48 hours' duration) and severe hyperammonemia should be cared for in a center capable of performing hemodialysis. Exchange transfusion does not effectively remove ammonia and should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Intravenous fluid administration, rather than hemodialysis, is often sufficient therapy in patients with arginase deficiency who present with milder hyperammonemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodialysis should be started as soon as possible after hospital admission of a patient with severe hyperammonemia. Continuous arteriovenous or venovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD or CVVHD) with flow rates &gt;40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> is optimal. Some centers use extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with hemodialysis. This technique provides very high flow rates (170 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> and rapidly reduces ammonia levels but with greater morbidity associated with surgical vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>If these procedures are not available, continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) may be used. This method is less desirable as an initial treatment, although it can be used effectively between hemodialysis treatments to continue removing ammonia (also known as detoxification). Peritoneal dialysis is the least acceptable method because clearance of ammonia is very slow and detoxification may take several days. It should be used only if no other option is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury#H3419961088\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Definition of CRRT modality'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemodialysis is stopped when the ammonia concentration has dropped below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> because it appears to have little effect below this level. However, plasma ammonia may increase again (rebound) because of the delay in the effect of nitrogen scavenging medications and the ongoing catabolism that continues to produce waste nitrogen. Reversal of the catabolic process typically takes 24 to 48 hours. It may take longer if infection is present. During this period, hemofiltration can be used to clear the newly produced nitrogen. Dialysis catheters should be kept in place until ammonia levels have been stable for at least 24 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic therapy of hyperammonemia consists of administration of a combination preparation of sodium phenylacetate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium benzoate</a>. These drugs scavenge ammonia by creating an alternate pathway to excrete nitrogen precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Phenylacetate combines with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, and benzoate combines with glycine to form hippurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These conjugation products are water soluble and are excreted in the urine. Thus, adequate renal function is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Disposal of glutamine and glycine reduces the total nitrogen pool. Pharmacokinetics for the biochemical conversions may vary from patient to patient. Signs of toxicity should be monitored during treatment. Drug levels can be obtained in specialized labs, but such testing is usually not accessible in the emergent treatment scenario.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A combined preparation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylacetate-and-sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate</a> (Ammonul) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2005 for parenteral delivery. For patients who weigh &le;20 kg, we use a loading dose of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of each drug) in a volume of 25 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose solution infused over 90 minutes. For patients who weigh &gt;20 kg, dosing is based upon body surface area. The loading dose is 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> (ie, 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> of each drug). The loading dose may be repeated in the rare case that a patient does not respond to dialysis. Drug levels could be monitored in this circumstance to avoid toxicity, including death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Maintenance infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylacetate-and-sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate</a> (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per 24 hours for patients &lt;20 kg, 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> per 24 hours as a continuous infusion for patients &gt;20 kg) is started when the loading dose is completed in the same volume as the priming dose (25 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span>. Maintenance infusion of Ammonul is continued until oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylbutyrate</a> can be tolerated (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management of infants after initial stabilization'</a> below). Additional intravenous fluid, 10 percent dextrose supplemented with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-acetate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium acetate</a> (2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/100</span> mL), should be given to provide a total of 1 to 1.5 times daily maintenance fluid requirements per 24 hours. The potassium will counteract the hypokalemic effects of the large sodium load (assuming normal urine output), while the acetate base will counteract the potential acidosis due to the large chloride load.</p><p>The effect of treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylacetate-and-sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate</a> on survival in patients with UCDs was evaluated in a 25-year (1980 to 2005) nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open-label study at 118 hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The study included 299 patients in whom there were 1181 episodes of hyperammonemia. Dialysis was used in addition to sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate for 60 percent of episodes of hyperammonemia in patients &lt;30 days of age and for 7 percent of episodes of hyperammonemia in patients &gt;30 days of age. Neurologic outcome was not evaluated.</p><p>Overall survival was 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Survival following episodes of hyperammonemia was 96 percent (73 percent in patients &lt;30 days of age, 98 percent in patients &gt;30 days of age, and 81 percent in patients who were comatose at the time of admission). By way of comparison, survival in 217 patients from a single institution who did not receive alternative pathway therapy was 16 percent for those with neonatal-onset UCD and 72 percent for those with late-onset UCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylacetate-and-sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate</a> therapy occurred in approximately one-half of patients. Most of these were metabolic (eg, hypokalemia, hyperchloremia, acidosis), neurologic (eg, seizures), or respiratory (eg, respiratory distress or failure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among the 49 patients who died, 13 received higher than recommended doses of sodium phenylacetate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium benzoate</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Arginine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enzyme deficiencies in the urea cycle (with the exception of arginase deficiency) prevent the formation of arginine, thus rendering it an essential amino acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Arginine deficiency results in a catabolic state that stimulates further mobilization of nitrogen from protein breakdown. In ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency, arginine also is needed to generate urea cycle intermediates, including ornithine, citrulline, and argininosuccinic acid. When arginine is provided, these water-soluble compounds can be formed and excreted, resulting in additional removal of ammonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>We administer intravenous arginine hydrochloride as part of the initial management along with dialysis and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylacetate-and-sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate</a>. In the absence of a diagnosis of the specific form of UCD, and for patients &le;20 kg, the loading dose is 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dissolved in 25 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose solution infused over 90 minutes. For patients &gt;20 kg, the loading dose is 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span>.</p><p>The maintenance dose is started after the loading dose. In carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) or OTC deficiency, or if the specific UCD is not yet identified, the maintenance dose is 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per 24 hours for patients &le;20 kg and 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> per 24 hours for patients &gt;20 kg. For ASS and ASL deficiency, the maintenance dose is 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per 24 hours for patients &le;20 kg and 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> per 24 hours for patients &gt;20 kg intravenous. This higher dose of arginine increases the generation of citrulline (in ASS deficiency) and argininosuccinic acid (in ASL deficiency), which enhances nitrogen excretion. Blood pressure should be monitored since high doses of intravenous arginine can decrease blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Citrulline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In OTC or CPS deficiency, small oral doses of citrulline (150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per 24 hours for patients &le;20 kg and 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> per 24 hours for patients &gt;20 kg) also are provided because of the theoretical advantage of incorporating aspartate nitrogen for clearance as urea in disorders upstream of ASS. Citrulline should not be given if the diagnosis is unknown, because citrulline levels are elevated in ASS and ASL deficiencies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Carglumic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carglumic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Carglumic acid</a> (Carbaglu), which was previously available outside the United States, was approved by the US FDA in March 2010 for the treatment of hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Carglumic acid is able to activate the first enzyme of the urea cycle (CPSI), leading to rapid reduction of plasma ammonia to normal levels. It is used for both acute and chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylacetate-and-sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate</a> (Ammonul) is used in addition to carglumic acid if the hyperammonemia is severe; otherwise, carglumic acid can be used alone. The initial dose for acute hyperammonemia ranges from 100 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> orally (prepared as a liquid and divided into two to four doses that are given immediately before meals). The dose is adjusted according to the patient's symptoms and plasma ammonia level.

Sodium phenylacetate administration may cause potassium depletion.</p><p>Ammonia concentration is measured hourly during dialysis. After dialysis is completed and ammonia levels have stabilized below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> for at least 24 hours, the frequency of measurements can be reduced to every four hours. Testing can be reduced further to every 12 hours after a stable oral drug regimen is established and then daily until the patient is clinically ready for discharge from the hospital.</p><p>Serum amino acids can be measured daily, if immediate testing is available, to help assess the efficacy of glutamine removal and to determine if replacement of arginine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> citrulline is sufficient. Neurologic morbidity is directly correlated with the duration of hyperammonemia. Hence, normalization of blood ammonia levels should be the management priority.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTEIN RESTRICTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catabolic stress should be avoided and protein intake should be restricted to minimize the nitrogen load from protein breakdown or feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. On the other hand, excessive and prolonged restriction of protein intake will stimulate peripheral mobilization of nitrogen.</p><p>In acute hyperammonemia with encephalopathy, oral feedings are discontinued. Calories are provided by intravenous administration of lipids and glucose, and protein intake is stopped. Protein should not be completely restricted longer than the first 24 to 48 hours after treatment is initiated to avoid protein catabolism resulting in increased circulating nitrogen. If enteral intake of amino acids is not possible because of neurologic compromise, essential amino acids should be administered parenterally.</p><p>The recommended daily protein intake varies with age and ranges from 2.0 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day at birth to less than 0.6 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day in adults. Children with UCDs typically require even less than the recommended daily intake of protein for normal growth. Patients with partial deficiency of a urea cycle enzyme may tolerate greater protein intake. The daily intake of protein and amino acids is adjusted according to the patient's age, growth rate, monitoring laboratories (ie, essential amino acid levels in the blood, prealbumin, albumin, and hemoglobin), and clinical course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the transition to food protein, we measure serum levels of essential amino acids (eg, branched chain amino acids, phenylalanine, lysine), which reflect adaptation to the protein intake during the previous 48 hours. The target goal is the low-normal range for these essential amino acids. Samples are obtained three to four hours after feeding and repeated every two to three days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF INFANTS AFTER INITIAL STABILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In newborns who have stabilized, we begin by providing approximately 1.5 to 1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day of protein as an intravenous amino acid solution. We monitor ammonia levels at least daily and plasma amino acid levels at least every two to three days. If this rate of protein infusion is tolerated, we discontinue the intravenous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylacetate-and-sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate</a> and administer oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylbutyrate</a> (Buphenyl, 400 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per 24 hours for patients &le;20 kg and 9 to 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> per 24 hours for patients &gt;20 kg). Sodium phenylbutyrate is converted to phenylacetate, which promotes urinary clearance of nitrogenous waste. Citrulline (170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally) is given in ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) deficiencies, and arginine base (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally), <strong>not</strong> the arginine hydrochloride solution used in intravenous therapy, is given in argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiencies. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerol-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycerol phenylbutyrate</a> (Ravicti, 4.5 to 11.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> divided in three equal doses) is an alternative to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylbutyrate</a> that is approved for patients two months of age and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a pre-prodrug of phenylacetate. It requires pancreatic lipase conversion into phenylbutyrate, which is then oxidized into phenylacetate. Thus, it acts as a slow-release form of sodium phenylbutyrate, achieving more stable control of ammonia levels over a 24-hour period. In addition, it may offer advantages with regards to tolerability and palatability since it is a colorless and tasteless oil with no sodium content. However, its use is contraindicated in infants under two months of age due to immature pancreatic exocrine function that could lead to insufficient drug metabolism. Glycerol phenylbutyrate was noninferior to sodium phenylbutyrate in controlling ammonia levels over 24 hours in two randomized, crossover trials of patients with UCD (one with 45 adults and 20 children six years of age and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and the other with 15 children &lt;6 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]). In an uncontrolled 12-month extension study, patients showed improved measures of executive functioning compared with baseline on enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A direct conversion of dosing can be calculated for patients already on sodium phenylbutyrate: Total daily dose glycerol phenylbutyrate (mL) = 0.8 x total daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate (grams). Dosing can be guided by fasting ammonia levels (with a target less than one-half the upper limit of normal), serum phenylacetate levels, and urinary phenylacetylglutamine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phenylbutyrate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerol-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycerol phenylbutyrate</a> require bioconversion to the active ingredient, phenylacetate. Environmental <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic factors may alter bioavailability. In addition, elevated levels of phenylacetate and phenylbutyrate are associated with neurotoxicity in cancer patients treated with these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Thus, metabolite levels should be monitored to assess for potential drug toxicity or reasons for suboptimal clinical response to treatment. Between 60 to 75 percent of the phenylbutyrate dose is converted to phenylacetylglutamine. Twenty-four hour urinary phenylacetylglutamine (or morning spot urine) correlates well with the daily dose of phenylbutyrate and is a good measure of effective bioconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Measurement of metabolite can be performed to guide dose adjustment when there is suboptimal clinical control, as evidenced by recurrent hyperammonemic episodes.</p><p>Enteral feeding is initiated as soon as possible. A nasogastric tube may be needed to ensure appropriate intake. Infants are fed a protein-free formula, such as Mead Johnson 80056 or Ross Formula ProPhree, in conjunction with amino acid mixtures and cow milk-based formulas. One-half of the daily protein requirement is usually given as amino acid mixture and one-half as cow milk protein because the nitrogen load in free amino acid solutions is less than that of complex proteins. The recommended daily intake of protein in patients with a UCD varies with age and is determined by monitoring of nutritional biomarkers. It is usually less than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for age. A dietitian experienced in dietary therapy of inborn errors of metabolism should manage the diet. The daily fluid intake required to maintain a good urine output should also be calculated.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Sodium phenylbutyrate</a>, sodium phenylacetate, and probably also <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerol-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycerol phenylbutyrate</a> can selectively depress branched chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Branched chain amino acid supplementation may be warranted in patients who have low concentrations of leucine, valine, and isoleucine and other signs of protein insufficiency (eg, low prealbumin and albumin), especially if they have normal concentrations of other essential amino acids. Chronic administration of sodium phenylbutyrate is associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects (eg, gastritis). Therefore, proton pump inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">omeprazole</a>, are suggested. Significant gastrointestinal side effects are not expected with glycerol phenylbutyrate, due to differences in drug metabolism. Monitoring of chronic therapy includes plasma amino acids, measures of liver function, and nutritional markers (eg, prealbumin, albumin, plasma amino acids, complete blood count). The frequency of monitoring depends upon the age of the patient and can range from every one to two months in a growing infant to once per year in an adult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2724240804\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory monitoring during chronic management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring during follow-up visits should focus on identifying and preventing overzealous protein restriction, essential amino acid deficiency, and increased nitrogen flux through the body. Prealbumin and albumin measurement will reflect protein sufficiency over the previous weeks to months, respectively. Plasma amino acid and ammonia measurements should be performed fasting (prior to a feed or medication dose).</p><p>In a study of over 100 adult and pediatric patients who participated in the clinical trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerol-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycerol phenylbutyrate</a>, patients with baseline (fasting) glutamine values &gt;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> had higher baseline ammonia levels than patients with baseline glutamine &le;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span>. Glutamine values &gt;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> during the study were associated with an approximately twofold higher risk of hyperammonemic crisis. However, glutamine lost predictive significance when concomitant ammonia was taken into account, whereas the predictive value of baseline ammonia &ge;1 upper limit of normal (ULN) was highly statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. For patients with fasting ammonia concentrations &lt;0.5 ULN, 0.5 to &lt;1 ULN, and &ge;1 ULN, the probability of a normal average daily ammonia value was 87, 60, and 39 percent, respectively, and 10.3, 14.1, and 37 percent of these patients, respectively, experienced one or more hyperammonemic crises over 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Hence, optimal pharmacologic and dietary treatment should strive to achieve normal fasting glutamine and low-normal fasting ammonia levels in the context of protein sufficiency as evidenced by low-normal levels of prealbumin and essential amino acids. To optimize dosing of phenylbutyrate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerol-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycerol phenylbutyrate</a>, their metabolites, phenylacetate (PAA) and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN), can be measured in patients. A curvilinear relationship was observed between PAA levels and the plasma PAA:PAGN ratio, and a ratio &gt;2.5 (both in <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> in a random blood draw identified patients at risk for PAA levels &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> a level associated with toxicity in previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Thus, administration through the gastrostomy tube is preferable.

Parents must be taught to recognize the signs of early hyperammonemia, including irritability and vomiting. They should know the factors that may trigger a metabolic crisis, such as infection or fever, and understand the importance of preventive measures. There is no association between hyperammonemic episodes and immunizations in children with UCDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], nor is there an associated increased risk of serious adverse events due to immunizations in children with inborn errors of metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Ammonia levels should be monitored during these periods.</p><p>Protein tolerance in affected children usually increases with age. Thus, the greatest risk of hyperammonemia during the first year is due to the protein catabolism associated with viral illnesses. Efforts should be made to avoid infectious exposures, especially during the first year. Prophylaxis to respiratory syncytial virus should be considered. Parents should notify the metabolic specialist immediately if the child becomes ill or shows early signs of hyperammonemia. Protein intake can be adjusted during acute illnesses in conjunction with a metabolic dietician. The management of subsequent episodes of hyperammonemia is the same as the management for the initial episode.</p><p>In specific disorders, unique pathophysiologic mechanisms may suggest adjunctive treatments. As an example, some patients with argininosuccinic aciduria have evidence of nitric oxide (NO) depletion and show signs of hypertension. This hypertension may be responsive to NO sources such as nitrite. In one case study, nitrite supplementation reversed chronic, longstanding hypertension that was unresponsive to other standard forms of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The indications for liver transplantation are relative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A careful analysis of the risks and benefits for individual patients should be performed by a multidisciplinary team of clinical biochemical geneticists, transplant surgeons, hepatologists, developmental pediatricians, psychologists, and social workers in conjunction with the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. In the United States, liver transplantation is considered for newborns with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) or ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, in patients who have not responded to medical therapy, and in argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency associated with cirrhosis. However, patients with any form of UCD may be candidates for liver transplantation if medical therapy has failed to prevent recurrent hyperammonemia.</p><p>A review of 51 cases of liver transplantation for UCD (38 previously published reports and a series of 13 patients from one institution) revealed the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for liver transplantation included OTC deficiency (22 patients), type II argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) deficiency (type II citrullinemia, 20 patients), type I ASS deficiency (type I citrullinemia, 4 patients), and arginase deficiency (1 patient).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median age of onset of UCD was 31.5 months (range: 0 to 62 years), and the median time from onset of UCD to liver transplantation was nine months (range: 0.5 to 202 months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall cumulative patient survival was 91 percent at 5 and 10 years.

Neurologic complications remained in 7 of the 47 patients in whom neurologic status was evaluated (six of these received their transplantation in early infancy).

None of the donors showed consistent signs of hyperammonemia in the early postoperative period or later.</p><p/><p>In another study, early liver transplantation in patients who presented with acute hyperammonemia of limited duration (&lt;24 hours on average) had improved developmental outcome compared with historical trends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>In a 2015 review of the United Network of Organ Sharing Database, children and adults with UCDs who underwent transplant had overall 1-, 5-, and 10-year survivals of 93, 89, and 87 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Orthotopic liver transplantation has a higher rate of complications when performed in infancy, primarily due to the size of the graft. However, delaying transplantation can lead to irreversible neurologic complications. Thus, alternative options are under investigation, including liver cell and stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Liver cell transplantation is much less invasive and has been performed successfully in several newborns and older children. However, the long-term stability of the transplant is uncertain.

The five-year survival was 22 and 41 percent for the neonatal- and late-onset UCDs, respectively.

Outcome was associated with the peak blood ammonia concentration during the initial presentation. Severe damage was not seen if the ammonia concentration was &lt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L,</span> whereas patients with levels &gt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> had severe deficits or died. In the second Japanese study, a peak initial ammonia concentration &gt;360 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> was also a marker of poor prognosis, although 18 patients with levels above this cutoff at presentation had normal neurodevelopment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>In another study, long-term neurologic morbidity was related to the duration of hyperammonemia and not to peak ammonia levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Some patients have hepatomegaly that may be associated with abnormal liver function tests, although the mechanism is unknown. Accumulated longitudinal data suggest that liver dysfunction is a common complication of UCDs. The liver dysfunction is not usually clinically significant, although it may be acutely exacerbated during intercurrent illness or metabolic decompensation.</p><p>The natural history of these disorders continues to be elucidated. Some long-term morbidity may be unrelated to hyperammonemia and may instead reflect the integration of urea cycle intermediates within intermediary metabolism. As an example, synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) is dependent upon arginine. Thus, dysregulation of NO function is possible in some UCDs in which arginine is depleted, such as argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Liver dysfunction can be a significant chronic complication of ASA due to deficiency of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) that leads to depletion of arginine. In the same vein, neurologic morbidity does not appear to correlate with the frequency of hyperammonemia in patients with ASA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], and primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) may also be associated with deficient NO production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urea-cycle-disorders-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. These emerging correlations are just beginning to be understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urea cycle is the metabolic pathway that transforms nitrogen to urea for excretion from the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60652\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60652 \">figure 1</a>). Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are caused by deficiency of an enzyme in the pathway: carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), N-acetyl glutamate synthetase (NAGS), and arginase.

These drugs scavenge ammonia by creating an alternate pathway to excrete nitrogen precursors. Administration of arginine is also necessary for all UCDs except arginase deficiency (argininemia) because deficiencies of these enzymes prevent the formation of arginine, resulting in a catabolic state. Arginine also generates more urea cycle intermediates upstream of the block. The urinary excretion of these upstream intermediates further acts as a nitrogen disposal pathway. In addition, administration of citrulline may be helpful in OTC and CPSI deficiencies. Citrulline should not be administered if the enzyme deficiency is not known, because citrulline levels are elevated in ASS and ASL deficiencies. Finally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carglumic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carglumic acid</a>, which can activate the first enzyme in the urea cycle (CPSI) downstream of NAGS, is effective in treating NAGS deficiency.

We suggest liver transplantation for newborns with CPSI or OTC deficiency, in patients who have not responded to medical therapy, and in ASL deficiency associated with cirrhosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6407689\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic management of UCD involves frequent measurement of ammonia and plasma amino acids. Fasting ammonia correlates positively with daily ammonia exposure and with the risk and rate of hyperammonemic crises. Management should strive towards low normal levels of ammonia, normal glutamine levels, and normal essential amino acids in the fasting state. Additionally, in patients treated with phenylbutyrate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerol-phenylbutyrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycerol phenylbutyrate</a>, measurement of drug metabolites can be useful in guiding dosing adjustments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality and morbidity are high in UCDs. Patients often grow poorly and have neurodevelopmental problems.
