Popliteal aneurysm is often diagnosed as a result of screening tests or other imaging studies (other aneurysm, peripheral artery disease) in patients who do not have obvious symptoms of vascular disease. When symptoms are present, they are due to a variable degree of lower extremity ischemic symptoms that can include claudication, distal ischemia due to chronic embolization or acute limb-threatening ischemia due to thrombosis of the aneurysm or acute thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with symptomatic popliteal aneurysm should be referred for vascular evaluation and repair. The management of asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms depends upon patient comorbidities, the size of the aneurysm and the presence or absence of arterial thrombus. </p><p>Issues related to popliteal artery aneurysm will be reviewed here. The surgical and endovascular management of popliteal aneurysm is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-popliteal-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035293\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035309\"><span class=\"h2\">Popliteal anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The popliteal artery is in continuity with the superficial femoral artery. Anatomic landmarks include the tendinous insertion of the adductor magnus muscle in the distal femur superiorly, and the bifurcation of the popliteal artery into the anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk at the level of the tibial tuberosity inferiorly. </p><p>Popliteal aneurysms are true aneurysms involving all layers of the vessel wall (intima, media, adventitia). Pseudoaneurysm formation in the popliteal artery has also been described but is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Popliteal aneurysms are described as fusiform (ie, diffusely dilated) or saccular (ie, rounded and typically asymmetric). Fusiform dilation of the popliteal artery may be contiguous with fusiform dilation of the superficial femoral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Aneurysm shape may have clinical implications. (See <a href=\"#H1315277\" class=\"local\">'Rupture'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20025875\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of popliteal aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any vessel, the popliteal artery is defined as aneurysmal when focal dilation is identified and the diameter of the vessel is increased more than 50 percent relative to the vessel's normal diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90998 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].<strong> </strong>The normal diameter of the mid-popliteal artery ranges from 0.7 to 1.1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The normal superficial femoral artery (SFA) diameter can be used as a reference if the entire extent of the popliteal artery is aneurysmal. In one ultrasound study, the distal SFA most closely approximated normal mid-popliteal artery diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035316\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The media and adventitia provide the strength of the vessel wall. The elements of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the media, which include elastin, collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), bear the circumferential stress imparted by blood pressure on the arterial wall. Smooth muscle of the media (ie, cellular component) produces ECM in response to a variety of factors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H705779749\"><span class=\"h2\">Aneurysm formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aneurysm formation is due to a loss of the mechanical integrity of the vessel wall due to an altered balance between the production and degradation of these vascular wall constituents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The etiology of this imbalance is multifactorial and likely a complex interplay of inflammatory, immunologic and potentially mechanical and genetic factors. A common systemic etiology for large vessel (eg, aorta, femoral, iliac, popliteal) aneurysm formation is supported by the occurrence of multiple aneurysms in the same patient. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammation</strong> &mdash; Inflammatory infiltrate is seen within the wall of the popliteal artery and is similar to that seen in aortic aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The exact role of the inflammatory process is unknown, although the release of reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteinases appears to underlie elastin and collagen degradation. Depletion of medial smooth muscle cells through apoptosis is an important mechanism that reduces extracellular matrix production impairing arterial wall repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunologic</strong> &mdash; A dysregulated autoimmune response against components of the aortic wall is postulated to contribute to aneurysm formation. Although autoantigens have been identified within the wall of abdominal aortic aneurysms, the role of autoimmunity in the development of popliteal aneurysm has not been addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic factors</strong> &mdash; Patients with peripheral aneurysm have a 10 percent familial incidence rate for aneurysm. Males are more likely to be affected than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Multiple observational studies have also found that patients with arteriomegaly have an increased incidence of aneurysm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/7,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13-16</a>]. These observations, together with an increased incidence of aneurysm formation in multiple genetic conditions, suggest that genetic factors play a role in aneurysmal degeneration of the arterial wall. For abdominal aneurysm, genetic markers for inflammatory mediators have been identified; however, specific mechanisms in the development of popliteal aneurysm are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanical factors </strong>&mdash; Mechanical factors are also believed to contribute to the formation of popliteal aneurysm. Abnormal arterial wall stress (due to hypertension), vibration and turbulence may contribute to arterial wall degeneration. Repeated flexion and extension of the knee may be another factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Turbulent flow distal to a relative stenosis is known to cause vessel dilation in the distal segment (ie, post-stenotic dilatation). Within the lower extremity arterial system, the adductor hiatus and arcuate popliteal ligament may represent areas of relative arterial stenosis. As an example, popliteal entrapment due to abnormal insertions of the thigh muscle tendons can lead to popliteal aneurysm formation, which can be bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035323\"><span class=\"h2\">Expansion and thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of popliteal aneurysm growth is not as well-defined as that of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Aneurysm expansion rates similarly depend upon artery diameter; however, in prospective observational studies, expansion of ectatic (ie, dilated but not aneurysmal) popliteal arteries is generally slow, but variable and difficult to predict.<strong> </strong>Published expansion rates for small (ie, 1.5 to 2.0 cm) popliteal aneurysms range from 0.7 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year</span> while growth rates for larger aneurysms range from 1.5 to 3.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. A significant number of popliteal aneurysms do not demonstrate expansion. In one study, for example, 60 of 67 popliteal aneurysms did not demonstrate progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As with abdominal aortic aneurysm, a concurrent diagnosis of diabetes has been correlated with slower expansion rates.</p><p>The presence of mural thrombus within the popliteal aneurysm may have clinical implications. Mural thrombus may be associated with aneurysm enlargement, but it is unclear if the thrombus contributes to the etiology or is merely a byproduct of expansion. The mean growth rate of vessels with and without mural thrombus was 1.9 and 0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year,</span> respectively, in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Others have suggested that thrombus increases the risk of embolism and thus thrombus, in addition to size and symptoms, is an indicator of the need for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1231035395\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>In a retrospective review of thrombosed aneurysms, proximal superficial femoral artery occlusion and poor distal runoff were independent factors associated with popliteal artery thrombosis probably due to stagnant flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035330\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Popliteal artery aneurysms are the most common true peripheral aneurysm, occurring more frequently than femoral artery aneurysms, but less frequently than abdominal aortic aneurysm. The prevalence of popliteal aneurysm in the general population is difficult to determine, but appears to be increasing possibly due to more common use of imaging modalities and an aging population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>A screening study of 1074 men identified popliteal artery aneurysm in 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another screening study of men between the ages of 65 and 74, abdominal aortic aneurysms were identified in 4.9 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Of these patients, 6.8 percent had femoral artery aneurysms and 9.6 percent had popliteal artery aneurysms. </p><p>Men are more commonly affected than women and present at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In one study of hospitalized patients, the incidence of femoral or popliteal artery aneurysms was 7.4 per 100,000 males and 1.0 per 100,000 females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035337\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for popliteal aneurysm are similar to those of other large vessel aneurysms (abdominal aorta, iliac, femoral) and include smoking, hypertension, male sex, advancing age, and arteriomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H1382371318\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Fifty to 75 percent of patients are smokers and 40 to 60 percent have hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Ten percent of patients also have cerebrovascular disease and more than 40 percent have significant cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Up to 15 percent of patients with popliteal aneurysm have diabetes mellitus; however, diabetes appears to provide a protective effect with slower aneurysm growth rates similar to that seen with abdominal aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/19,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1231035323\" class=\"local\">'Expansion and thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Approximately 40 percent of patients with popliteal artery aneurysms will have an abdominal aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33</a>]. For this reason, patients with popliteal aneurysm should be screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H1316494\" class=\"local\">'Screening for other aneurysm'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035344\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of popliteal artery aneurysm ranges from the finding of an asymptomatic pulsatile popliteal mass on routine physical examination to acute limb-threatening ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H1231035388\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035351\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients are asymptomatic at the time of initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,34</a>]. For some patients, popliteal aneurysm is identified as an incidental finding on a radiologic study (eg, plain film, magnetic resonance imaging) performed for another indication (eg, knee pain) or in the course of evaluating aneurysmal disease elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H1231035388\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035358\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The probability of developing complications increases over time, with 60 to 74 percent of patients with popliteal aneurysm developing symptoms due to thromboembolism, localized mass effect, or rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,22,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,35-39</a>]. Popliteal aneurysms &ge;2.0 cm are at a higher risk for thromboembolic events compared with smaller aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40</a>]. Depending upon time course, thrombosis can cause symptoms of acute or chronic arterial insufficiency as a result of popliteal occlusion, distal embolization or popliteal stenosis. Symptoms may also develop as a result of localized &quot;mass effect&quot; within the confined space of the popliteal fossa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1314527\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can present with claudication to varying degrees as the initial symptom of popliteal aneurysm. Progressive luminal narrowing of the popliteal artery or even occlusion of the popliteal artery from thrombus can cause insidious or more sudden onset of claudication. In one retrospective review, one-third of patients who presented with aneurysm thrombosis had some degree of claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Claudication may improve as collateral blood flow develops, or the patient may develop clinical signs of more progressive ischemia (ie, ischemic rest pain, gangrene). Repeated episodes of distal embolization can progressively occlude the outflow vessels (anterior tibial, tibioperoneal trunk), slowing flow and leading to thrombosis of the aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Some patients initially present with thromboemboli manifested as a &quot;blue toe syndrome&quot;. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If the patient does not develop adequate collateral arterial blood flow around a thrombosed aneurysm, symptoms and signs of chronic limb ischemia will manifest that are indistinguishable from occlusive atherosclerotic disease. Patients with claudication from a thrombosed popliteal aneurysm usually have a more sudden onset of symptoms compared with patients who have atherosclerotic occlusion. Smaller aneurysms may have more of a propensity to thrombose compared with larger aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1314534\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most dramatic presentation of popliteal artery aneurysm is acute limb threatening ischemia due to abrupt popliteal aneurysm thrombosis, which occurs in up to one-third of patients who are followed conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of patients with thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms will present with acute ischemia; the remainder will have chronic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Embolization of thrombotic debris can also acutely reduce perfusion to the extremity leading to classic symptoms of acute ischemia (ie, pain, pallor, poikilothermia, pulselessness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Risk factors for popliteal aneurysm thrombosis include diameter &gt;2 cm, the presence of thrombus, and poor distal runoff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence of limb loss ranges between 20 and 60 percent for patients presenting with acute limb ischemia, in spite of timely and adequate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1315270\"><span class=\"h3\">Local compressive symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local symptoms are uncommon unless the aneurysm is large (&gt;3.0 cm). Local pain or a sensation of fullness behind the knee is due to a mass effect from the aneurysm. Patients may experience sensory or motor nerve deficits from compression of the sciatic, tibial, or peroneal nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Compression of the popliteal veins can lead to ipsilateral extremity swelling, the development of varicose veins or symptoms of phlebitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1315277\"><span class=\"h3\">Rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture leading to severe pain behind the knee occurs in fewer than 5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In these cases, the hemorrhage is usually confined to the popliteal space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88904\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88904 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].<strong> </strong>Saccular aneurysms are thought to have a higher risk for this complication compared with fusiform aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Popliteal aneurysm rupture into the popliteal vein causing arteriovenous fistula has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231035388\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a part of a routine vascular examination, the popliteal fossae bilaterally should be routinely palpated, ideally with the knee slightly flexed. Sixty percent of patients with popliteal aneurysm have a pulsatile popliteal mass which is located at or above the level of the knee joint. Bilateral popliteal artery aneurysms are present in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. A popliteal aneurysm may not be palpable if the aneurysm is small (ie, &lt;2 cm), or if thrombosis has occurred. The patient should also be examined for clinical signs of distal embolization. The clinical signs of thromboembolism due to popliteal aneurysm are similar to those due to aortic pathologies, which are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of popliteal aneurysm is confirmed with the noninvasive radiographic visualization of an abnormally dilated (ie, &ge;1.5 times normal diameter) popliteal artery. Noninvasive imaging can be accomplished with duplex ultrasound, computed tomographic (CT) angiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88903\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88903 \">image 2</a>), or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. The choice of modality depends upon institutional resources and the clinical presentation. These modalities can also exclude other entities that present as a popliteal mass (eg, Baker&rsquo;s cyst) or cause lower extremity pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-bakers-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal (Baker's) cyst&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Duplex ultrasonography is the first-line imaging modality when popliteal aneurysm is suspected. Ultrasound quickly confirms the diagnosis and diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65760\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65760 \">image 3</a>) of popliteal aneurysm, provides information about patency (or occlusion) of the popliteal artery and outflow vessels, and identifies the presence (or absence) and nature of thrombus, as well as the presence of coexisting aneurysmal disease. When duplex ultrasonography is not available, CT or MR angiography can be used. Conventional arteriography does not accurately determine aneurysm size when intraluminal thrombus is present.</p><p>Imaging the inflow and outflow vessels is important for planning elective popliteal aneurysm repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50705\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50705 \">image 4</a>). The main advantage of CT and MR angiography over conventional arteriography is their ability to accurately measure true lumen arterial diameters if endovascular therapy is under consideration and to define surrounding structures, which may have other anatomic abnormalities (eg, abnormal muscle attachments, tumor). These modalities, like duplex ultrasound, can also be used to evaluate the presence of associated aneurysms. </p><p>Conventional arteriography is more appropriate for the patient who presents with acute symptoms because it provides an opportunity for thrombolytic therapy, if indicated. Depending upon the severity of ischemia, urgent or emergent arteriography should be performed to identify a suitable outflow vessel for lower extremity revascularization. For patients with non-critical ischemia, the interventional radiology suite is suitable; however, patients with immediate limb-threatening ischemia (Rutherford IIb, III) should be evaluated in the operating room. (See <a href=\"#H16064863\" class=\"local\">'Role of antithrombotic therapy and thrombolysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Noninvasive vascular testing (ankle-brachial index, segmental pressures, pulse volume recordings) does not establish a diagnosis of popliteal aneurysm.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is generally treated first, followed by repair of the popliteal aneurysm unless limb-threatening ischemia is present. While it is likely that popliteal artery aneurysm thrombosis is the cause of the limb-threatening ischemia, embolization to the popliteal artery from an aortic aneurysm cannot be excluded. Thus, once the popliteal aneurysm repair is completed, aortic aneurysm repair should be undertaken as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>In the setting of concomitant ipsilateral common or superficial femoral artery aneurysms, popliteal artery aneurysms are typically repaired at the same time using a bypass procedure.

The popliteal artery is defined as aneurysmal when a localized diameter is 1.5 times normal artery diameter. Risk factors for popliteal aneurysm include smoking, hypertension, male sex, advancing age, other large vessel aneurysm, and arteriomegaly. (See <a href=\"#H1231035330\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1231035293\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial obstruction as a complication of a popliteal artery aneurysm may be due to popliteal artery thrombosis or distal embolization of intraluminal thrombus. The time course of ischemic symptoms can be acute presenting as limb-threatening ischemia (a surgical emergency), or chronic if sufficient collateral flow is established around areas of occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H1231035344\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of popliteal aneurysm is based upon noninvasive radiographic visualization of an abnormally dilated (ie, &ge;1.5 times normal diameter) popliteal artery. Duplex ultrasound is the initial test of choice, although computed tomographic (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography may also be appropriate depending upon availability of ultrasound, and the urgency of the clinical situation. Conventional arteriography alone does not reliably demonstrate the presence of an aneurysm but is essential for planning surgical repair or performing endovascular repair or thrombolysis, if indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1231035388\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with acute lower extremity ischemic symptoms due to popliteal aneurysm (any size), we recommend emergent popliteal aneurysm repair due to the high risk of limb loss without treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We suggest thrombolytic therapy prior to repair for patients with absent or limited distal runoff; restoration of outflow improves the long-term patency of revascularization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Thrombolytic agents can be administered intraoperatively or using catheter-based techniques depending upon the clinical scenario. The patient should be anticoagulated with intravenous heparin while awaiting repair. (See <a href=\"#H1231035395\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with patent popliteal aneurysm &ge;2.0 cm, we suggest elective repair of the aneurysm over conservative management for patients at low risk for perioperative surgical morbidity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Elective aneurysm repair is associated with a lower long-term risk of limb-threatening ischemia and limb loss. (See <a href=\"#H1231035395\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with popliteal aneurysm &lt;2.0 cm are typically observed. However, the presence of mural thrombus may increase the propensity for artery expansion and risk of thromboembolic complications. The role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in the conservative management of small popliteal artery aneurysms, and particularly those with mural thrombus, has not been defined. As such, some clinicians prefer to repair popliteal aneurysm &lt;2.0 cm when they are associated with significant thrombus. (See <a href=\"#H1231035395\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform serial physical examination and duplex ultrasonography every 6 to 12 months for patients who are managed conservatively.
