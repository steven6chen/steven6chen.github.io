Through the efforts of rabies control programs, the prevalence of human and canine rabies has decreased significantly in some countries. However, in Thailand, the proportion of dogs testing positive for rabies averaged 54 percent in one report, indicating that rabies is still a major public health threat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-potentially-acquired-by-travel-to-southeast-asia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Furthermore, 42 percent of rabid dogs were less than six months old; this is the age group most likely to interact with humans and the group least likely to have received rabies vaccination. Thus, postexposure treatment is recommended following all potential exposures, and prophylaxis should be considered by travelers spending significant periods of time in the region.

The countries within this region are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The health risks vary considerably from region to region within Southeast Asia, although there are only a few places (eg, Singapore) where the risks do not differ appreciably from Western Europe, North America, and Australia.
