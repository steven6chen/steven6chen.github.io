Gastroparesis is one of the most underdiagnosed problems in cancer patients, and often overlooked as a potential etiology of chronic nausea and vomiting.</p><p>While the exact prevalence is not known, gastroparesis is common among patients with upper gastrointestinal tract tumors (gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, and biliary) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Pancreatic cancer-associated gastroparesis is common. Patients with pancreatic cancer often present with nausea and vomiting in the absence of mechanical obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These patients may also have a more generalized disorder of gastrointestinal motility, with components of dysphagia and abnormal small bowel motility (intestinal pseudo-obstruction, &quot;functional ileus&quot;). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gastroparesis is important to recognize for many reasons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The consequences of malignancy-associated gastroparesis can be serious, particularly in the context of other common problems that affect nutrition and fluid-electrolyte balance in cancer patients. If unrecognized and untreated, malignancy-associated gastroparesis can compound the anorexia and cachexia that often accompanies advanced cancer and the gastrointestinal side effects of specific anticancer treatments such as radiation or chemotherapy. The potential consequences include chronic nausea and vomiting, electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, hospitalization, and significant impairment of quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Assessment and management of nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Misdiagnosis of malignancy-associated gastroparesis as chemotherapy-induced emesis can lead to delays in administration of potentially efficacious anticancer therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroparesis is the single most common reason for gastric bezoar formation, and bezoars may be seen in gastroparesis of any etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>This topic review will cover malignancy-associated gastroparesis.

Among the most important etiologic factors are paraneoplastic phenomena, direct tumor infiltration of the celiac plexus or vagus nerve, past gastrointestinal surgery, and the toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, comorbidities such as poorly controlled diabetes, hypothyroidism, and neuromuscular disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52708\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52708 \">figure 1</a>), or the use of medications that delay gastric emptying (particularly narcotics), may also contribute to the development of gastroparesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Paraneoplastic gastrointestinal dysmotility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paraneoplastic gastric dysmotility should be considered in otherwise unexplained gastrointestinal motor dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Several patients have been described with small cell lung cancer (rarely other tumors such as breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer, carcinoid, retroperitoneal sarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]) in association with a paraneoplastic gastrointestinal motility disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/6,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-15</a>]. These patients often have antineuronal nuclear (ANNA-1, anti-Hu) antibodies which can be detected by an immunofluorescence-based assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. </p><p>The autoantibody is postulated to be directed toward an epitope that is shared between the neuronal elements within the enteric nervous system and the underlying malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a series of 162 patients with neurologic manifestations associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and antineuronal nuclear antibodies, 12 percent had solely a gastrointestinal motility disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The condition presented as achalasia, gastroparesis, or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.</p><p>Besides ANNA-1, other circulating autoantibodies that are associated with paraneoplastic gastrointestinal dysmotility include antineuronal antibodies type 2 (ANNA-2 or anti-Ri), amphiphysin antibody, type 1 Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody (PCA-1, also called anti-Yo), PCA-2, PCA-Tr, collapsing response modifier protein (CRMP) antibodies and antineuronal calcium channel antibodies of the <span class=\"nowrap\">P/Q</span> and N-type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72670\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72670 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The two most common are ANNA-1 and N-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism whereby a cross-reacting immune response results in disordered gastrointestinal motility has not been elucidated. Studies conducted in patients with SCLC and gastrointestinal dysmotility have demonstrated immune-mediated destruction of the interstitial cells of Cajal (the so-called intestinal pacemaker cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, others have suggested that dysmotility results from a visceral neuropathy of the myenteric plexus, caused by infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells, and subsequent axonal degeneration within the plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Postsurgical dysmotility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Described extensively in the literature, postsurgical gastroparesis often follows abdominal surgery involving the stomach or the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The mechanisms contributing to postsurgical gastroparesis are multiple. Vagotomy (or invasion of the vagal nerve from a tumor such as a cholangiocarcinoma), resection of the duodenum and parts of the stomach, the extent of lymphatic dissection, and the type of reconstruction can all influence the degree of postoperative gastroparesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of the duodenum results in reduced plasma concentrations of the hormone motilin which appears to be important for the antral contractions that clear nondigestible solid residues from the stomach during fasting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-delayed-gastric-emptying#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of delayed gastric emptying&quot;, section on 'Motor functions of the stomach regions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both standard pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) and pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy are associated with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis after a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy occurs either in the immediate postoperative period, a condition called early gastric stasis, or later as delayed postprandial gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Loss of phase III activity of the migrating motor complex normally seen in the fasting state has been suggested as the mechanism responsible for early gastric stasis. Recovery may be prolonged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Postprandial delayed gastric emptying occurs after the initiation of oral intake in patients who have undergone either a pylorus-preserving or standard Whipple surgery and ranges in incidence from 5 to 46 percent. Whether a pylorus-preserving procedure results in a higher frequency of delayed postprandial gastric emptying is unclear, as the available data are conflicting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stomach's accommodation response and contractility in response to distention are abolished following vagotomy and partial gastric resection. The vagus nerve carries the parasympathetic impulses to the stomach, and therefore vagotomy leads to hypo-peristalsis. While immediate early transfer of the liquid phase of the meal to the distal stomach and beyond is retained, emptying of solids is delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-delayed-gastric-emptying#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of delayed gastric emptying&quot;, section on 'Postvagotomy gastric motor dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive upper abdominal lymph node dissection is also associated with gastroparesis, possibly as a result of damage to the extrinsic nerves, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intra-abdominal inflammation caused by the dissection. Recovery from postprandial gastroparesis in these cases may take six months or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroparesis after surgery for gastric cancer is also influenced by the type of reconstruction. In one case series, the incidence of gastroparesis was significantly lower after a Billroth I gastrectomy than after Roux-en-Y reconstruction (4.3 versus 15.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the Roux stasis syndrome, which can occur after a Roux-en-Y anastomosis, stasis results from incoordination of contractions in the efferent Roux limb. This causes stasis in either the gastric remnant or in the Roux limb itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Celiac plexus injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical damage to the celiac plexus, resulting from either cancer infiltration or a celiac plexus nerve block, can also lead to gastroparesis, although this appears to be a rare complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Injury to the celiac plexus affects parasympathetic input to the stomach, resulting in loss of myenteric coordination.

Viral infection (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus) has been implicated in some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, gastric dysmotility with abnormalities in gastric myoelectric activity has been documented in the absence of viral infection among patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous HSCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>In addition, an upper gastrointestinal form of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) has been described that is characterized by anorexia, dyspepsia, food intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. This is more common following allogeneic than autologous HSCT, largely because of the higher rate of graft versus host disease in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Both gastric and duodenal obstruction are reported after RT for cholangiocarcinoma and are presumably due to radiation fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. There is little information on the overall incidence of radiation induced gastric dysmotility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting symptoms of cancer-associated gastroparesis include nausea, abdominal pain, early satiety, emesis, bloating, and weight loss. In one study, nausea was the major complaint in 93 percent of patients with gastroparesis, 89 percent had abdominal pain, 86 percent experienced early satiety, and vomiting occurred in 68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>However, nonspecific symptoms such as these are not uncommon among patients who have cancer, and may be attributed to the malignancy itself or various treatment modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Thus, in order to avoid misdiagnosis, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of gastroparesis.</p><p>Malignant gastroparesis should always be included in the differential diagnosis of patients who present the aforementioned constellation of symptoms, especially if the symptoms become more pronounced after ingestion of solid meals and if there is vomiting of food eaten several hours earlier. Malignancy-associated gastroparesis should particularly be suspected in cancer patients experiencing refractory, otherwise-unexplained nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Physical examination may be unrevealing or there may be epigastric distention or tenderness, but not guarding or rigidity. A succussion splash may be heard on auscultation of the epigastric area; this physical finding is due to stasis of the gastric contents.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be obtained in most cases. The endoscopic appearance of retained food and a dilated distended stomach with decreased peristalsis is strongly indicative of gastroparesis. If there are signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms to suggest small bowel pathology (such as a partial small bowel obstruction or generalized gastrointestinal dysmotility), an oral contrast upper GI tract series with small bowel follow-through is indicated.</p><p>Routine laboratory testing is not useful for the diagnosis of gastric stasis itself, although it may help to identify diseases that are associated with delayed gastric emptying, to rule out other disorders, and assess nutritional status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H259167108\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastric emptying scintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard test for establishing the diagnosis of gastroparesis is gastric scintigraphy following a standardized solid meal. Consensus standards for performing and reporting gastric emptying scintigraphy are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The suggested protocol involves a low fat meal (bread, jam, and scrambled egg substitute with technetium-99m pertechnetate) with imaging at zero, one, two, and four hours after meal ingestion. Normal values for the percent remaining in the stomach at the key time points are 37 to 90 percent at one hour, 30 to 60 percent at two hours, and 0 to 10 percent at four hours. In clinical practice, the most useful parameters to define gastroparesis are gastric retention of &gt;10 percent at four hours, and &gt;70 percent at two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to scintigraphy'</a> below.)</p><p>Liquid-phase gastric emptying (with the radioactive technetium-99m pertechnetate mixed in orange juice) can be performed if the patient cannot tolerate solids or when mechanical obstruction cannot be excluded. Delayed gastric emptying is defined as greater than 50 percent retention of gastric contents at 30 minutes.</p><p>The gastric emptying study was developed for use in patients with normal gastric anatomy. It may be difficult to interpret the study in postsurgical patients as there are no standardized controls for patients, with a subtotal or total gastrectomy. The study also does not quantify intestinal dysmotility, which also occurs in this patient population. Finally, scintigraphy bears some radiation hazard and may therefore not be suitable for repeated investigations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternatives to scintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative approaches for assessment of gastric emptying include wireless motility capsule testing and <sup>13</sup>C breath testing using octanoate or spirulina incorporated into a solid meal. While these tests have the advantage of avoiding radiation associated with scintigraphy, further studies are needed before they can be routinely recommended for evaluation of delayed gastric emptying.

(See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In settings where cisapride is not available, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> (40 to 80 mg orally per day in four divided doses) in countries where it is approved, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> (either subcutaneous or orally, 5 to 10 mg three to four times daily), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (125 to 250 mg orally three times daily) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> remain a concern, especially the risk of sudden death due to long QT syndrome when used in patients taking medications that inhibit CYP3A4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72735 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Erythromycin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of adverse effects from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> can be reduced if the dose is kept at or below 40 mg per day but the risk of potentially permanent extrapyramidal side effects with long-term use beyond three months must be discussed with patients. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Metoclopramide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All these prokinetics should be administered 10 to 15 minutes before meals; an additional dose before bedtime might be useful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During acute episodes of gastric stasis in which oral intake is not tolerated, we suggest IV administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (erythromycin lactobionate, 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every eight hours) to &quot;restart&quot; or &quot;kick-start&quot; the stomach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). An alternative is to use subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> (5 to 10 mg three times daily) after a test dose to exclude extrapyramidal adverse effects (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiemetics may help with nausea and vomiting. We recommend a drug of the phenothiazine class rather than a serotonin receptor antagonist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Antiemetic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> or a related agent is reasonable for patients who fail to respond to a prokinetic agent or a phenothiazine antiemetic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have persistent symptoms despite maximal dietary modification and pharmacologic therapy should be considered for more invasive means of palliation. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as a drainage gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tubes provide symptom palliation and nutritional support. In addition, another option that may be tried at experienced centers is placement of a gastric electrical stimulator. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Management options for refractory cases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States, other options are to pursue an emergency IND for cisapride or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Outside of the United States, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tegaserod-united-states-available-via-fda-emergency-access-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tegaserod</a> is another option. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cisapride'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Domperidone'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Tegaserod'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Schraml FV, Krueger WH.
