They are a significant problem in critically ill patients, the elderly, and in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).</p><p>Pressure ulcers cause pain, decrease quality of life, and lead to significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays, in part due to complicating infection. Infected pressure ulcers are a common problem, occurring in 4 to 6 percent of nursing home patients in two series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The infectious complications of pressure ulcers are reviewed in this topic.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76128204\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'NPUAP staging'</a>.)</p><p>These changes were made to recognize the fact that lesser degrees of skin damage due to pressure may not be associated with skin ulceration (Stage 1), and that deep tissue injury can occur without overlying skin ulceration (suspected deep tissue injury) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903 \">table 1</a>). However, their generalized term, &quot;pressure injury,&quot; does not address the many other types of injury that can result from pressure, such as rhabdomyolysis in an unconscious patient. </p><p>Thus, we will use the term &quot;pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot; to encompass the broad range of ischemic damage that can be caused by prolonged pressure. The terms &quot;pressure-induced skin injury&quot; or &quot;pressure-induced soft tissue (or deep tissue) injury&quot; are used where specifically applicable. We use the term &quot;pressure injury&quot; when referring to the staging of a specific lesion as defined by the NPUAP classification (eg, unstageable pressure injury), or to replace the term &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; in studies published prior to this classification change that use &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; generically when the stage is not specified. We use the term &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; for the specific circumstance where the integrity of the skin surface is disrupted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local factors that contribute to infection of pressure ulcers include breaks in the integrity of the skin barrier, pressure-induced changes, and contamination from contiguous dirty areas. The majority of pressure ulcers in SCI patients develop in areas adjacent to the ischium, sacrum, and greater trochanter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonization of the pressure ulcer by microorganisms precedes the development of infection. The ulcer is first colonized with skin flora, which is rapidly replaced by bacteria from the local environment and the urogenital or gastrointestinal tracts, often from direct fecal contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>High concentrations of bacteria in pressure ulcers inhibit normal wound healing and promote infection. In one study, delayed healing of pressure ulcers occurred when bacterial counts were &gt;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (CFU) per gram of tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The presence of biofilm is also being increasingly recognized as a cause of delayed healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Biofilm enables bacteria to better resist antimicrobials and host defenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The microbiology of pressure ulcers is similar whether the ulcer is superficial or deep. Nearly all infected pressure ulcers reveal multiple organisms when cultures are obtained.</p><p>A retrospective study of 168 surgical samples evaluated the microbiology of infected pressure ulcers in 101 SCI patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The predominant organisms were <em>Enterobacter</em> (29 percent), staphylococci (28 percent), and <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> (16 percent). A second study evaluated the microbiology of pressure ulcer-related bacteremia in SCI patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The major organisms were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA], methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em>, and coagulase-negative staphylococci), streptococci, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and anaerobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiologic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The challenge of microbiologic evaluation is to distinguish between bacterial invasion and colonization, since all pressure ulcers are colonized with microorganisms. Common culture techniques include quantitative swab culture, needle aspiration, and tissue or bone biopsy.</p><p>Although swab culture is the most frequently used technique, it reflects surface colonization rather than infection and is not clinically useful. However, for infection control practices, a swab culture may be useful in identifying patients colonized with MRSA or other resistant bacteria. In addition, physicians may have only the swab culture results to guide antibiotic selection in patients with signs of infection that are unable or unwilling to undergo a surgical procedure for tissue or bone biopsy.</p><p>A blood culture or a culture of a deep-tissue biopsy specimen is more clinically significant than culture from a superficial swab specimen. In one study, for example, the microbiology of 72 pressure ulcers was assessed by superficial swab, needle aspiration, and deep-tissue culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. More swab cultures were positive for microorganisms (96 percent) than either needle aspiration (43 percent) or deep-tissue biopsies (63 percent). The authors concluded that microorganisms identified on swab culture represented colonization whereas those from deep-tissue biopsies were more likely responsible for infection.</p><p>A second report compared the microorganisms recovered by needle aspiration from below the ulcer margin to those recovered by tissue biopsy from 12 decubitus ulcers from nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There was nearly complete concordance between the aspirate and biopsy cultures with a sensitivity of 93 percent and a specificity of 99 percent. However, the study was limited because of small sample size. If needle aspiration is performed, local anesthesia should not be used because of potential antibacterial activity.</p><p>Culturing deep tissue specimens sampled from a surgically cleaned and debrided ulcer remains the gold standard for wound culture. Once obtained, the specimen should be rapidly transported to the laboratory in the appropriate specimen containers for aerobic and anaerobic culture. When osteomyelitis is suspected, bone biopsy, if possible, with histopathologic and microbial analysis should guide the selection of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection of pressure ulcers often presents with local signs of soft tissue involvement, such as warmth, erythema, local tenderness, purulent discharge, and the presence of a foul odor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the manifestations of infection in pressure ulcers can be variable with delayed wound healing being the only sign of infection. Systemic signs, such as fever and leukocytosis, are often absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPERFICIAL INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of infection in the soft tissue or bone surrounding the ulcer affects management and can be divided into superficial and deep. Superficial infection includes localized infection without systemic signs, and non-healing ulcer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of superficial infection consists of local wound care and a trial of topical antiseptics to reduce bacterial counts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76470\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76470 \">algorithm 1</a>). Once debrided and the bacterial burden reduced (eg, tissue concentration of bacteria &lt;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units [CFU] per gram of tissue), pressure ulcers generally maintain a bacteria count of &lt;10<sup>2</sup> CFU per gram of tissue if cared for and kept free of necrotic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Fundamental components of local wound care include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debridement of necrotic tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of a moist wound dressing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure relief</p><p/><p>Guidelines published by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel emphasize the importance of managing the microbial burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Several topical antimicrobial agents reduce bacterial counts without damaging the wound, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver sulfadiazine</a> 1 percent cream, and other silver compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Some antiseptic agents, including povidone-iodine, peroxide, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate, are cytotoxic to human fibroblasts, can delay healing, and should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-containing-dressings-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Silver-containing dressings</a> have been gaining popularity but their efficacy remains to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Topical antibiotics are generally no longer recommended due to concerns about side effects and development of resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A one- to two-week trial of topical antiseptics is reasonable for clean pressure ulcers that fail to heal after two to four weeks of optimal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; although the evidence supporting their benefit is inconclusive, as reflected in a systematic review of 12 trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If there is no improvement with topical antiseptics, further work-up should be pursued, including a soft tissue biopsy for culture and evaluation for underlying osteomyelitis.

In addition, fever and leukocytosis may or may not be present. As a result, unrecognized infection may progress to involve deeper tissues. Fluctuance may develop and it may be possible to express pus from a sinus tract or from the ulcer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteomyelitis is a frequent complication of infected pressure ulcers and has been reported in 17 to 32 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. It can present as a poorly healing wound with or without systemic manifestations. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis, including clinical diagnostic clues and radiologic evaluation, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of osteomyelitis may be difficult to establish in patients with pressure ulcers. This issue was addressed in a study of 36 patients with pressure ulcers who were evaluated for osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The clinical judgment of physicians was accurate in diagnosing biopsy-proven osteomyelitis in only 56 percent of patients. There were no clinical signs or symptoms that correlated with a final diagnosis of osteomyelitis, including the presence of fever, bone exposure, duration of the ulcer, purulent drainage, leukocytosis, or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</p><p>Complications of unrecognized osteomyelitis include flap reconstruction failure, sepsis, and bacteremia. As a result, the diagnosis should be considered in these settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacteremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with pressure ulcers may develop bacteremia with or without clinical signs of sepsis (eg, unexplained fever, tachycardia, hypotension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deterioration in mental status).

In contrast, culture from a superficial swab specimen often reflects surface colonization rather than infection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Deep infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Microbiologic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of deep infections of pressure ulcers, including the use of magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate for osteomyelitis, is similar to that used for lower extremity infection in diabetic patients. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-diabetic-infections-of-the-lower-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of diabetic infections of the lower extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As most pressure ulcers occur in institutionalized patients or nursing home residents, infections with resistant microorganisms is common. Infection control is important in limiting their spread by cross-contamination. Additionally, prevention of the development of pressure ulcers will decrease infection rates and is thus critical to the care of poorly mobile patients. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Infection control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-pressure-ulcers/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Garibaldi RA, Brodine S, Matsumiya S.
