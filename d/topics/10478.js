The condition exists in 2 to 5 percent of children and can occur at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Untreated OSA is associated with cardiovascular complications, impaired growth (including failure to thrive), learning problems, and behavioral problems. Early diagnosis and treatment may decrease morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An overview of surgical and medical management of children with confirmed OSA (defined as apnea hypopnea index [AHI] &gt;1 on sleep study in the setting of clinically relevant symptoms) is reviewed here.

This requires carefully weighing the anticipated benefits and risks of treatment. Important considerations include the child's age, polysomnographic abnormalities, and any underlying medical issues or complications related to OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following considerations are applicable to most children for whom it has been determined that treatment of OSA is warranted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adenotonsillectomy</strong> &ndash; Children with polysomnography-confirmed OSA should be offered a referral to otolaryngology for evaluation. Adenotonsillectomy is first-line therapy for otherwise healthy children who have OSA and adenotonsillar hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the past, this approach was largely based upon clinical experience. In 2013, a randomized trial (Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial, CHAT) demonstrated an advantage of adenotonsillectomy over watchful waiting for children with uncomplicated OSA who were candidates for adenotonsillectomy (tonsil size &ge;1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Specifically, adenotonsillectomy provided better improvement in daytime behavior, sleep apnea symptoms, subjective sleepiness, and quality of life. However, no differences emerged in cognitive measures of attention or executive function that were the primary outcomes of the study. Selected areas of cognitive functioning did show benefit from adenotonsillectomy; these areas included nonverbal reasoning, fine motor skills, and selective attention, though the extent of improvement was limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Outcomes of adenotonsillectomy are covered in more depth separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2865702334\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Success rates'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children#H16053990\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive and behavioral consequences of sleep disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Sleep-related breathing disorders'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adenotonsillectomy also may be initial therapy for children with multifactorial OSA if appreciable adenotonsillar tissue is present. The rationale is that adenotonsillectomy may improve upper airway patency enough to ameliorate or resolve the OSA, even if it does not correct all of the etiologies. Such patients should be managed by a clinician experienced with pediatric sleep-related respiratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H186373135\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Indications for surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positive airway pressure therapy </strong>&ndash; Positive airway pressure therapy (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or bilevel positive airway pressure [BPAP]) is an alternate therapy to adenotonsillectomy. It can be employed when a patient with OSA has minimal adenotonsillar tissue, persistent OSA despite adenotonsillectomy, or a strong preference for a nonsurgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-11</a>]. Positive airway pressure may also help to stabilize children with severe OSA prior to adenotonsillectomy or another surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Positive airway pressure'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpap-for-pediatric-obstructive-sleep-apnea#H797216072\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;CPAP for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea&quot;, section on 'Treatment decisions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Watchful waiting</strong> &ndash; Several months of watchful waiting with supportive care may be considered in select cases of confirmed mild or moderate OSA (apnea-hypopnea index &gt;1 and &lt;30 on polysomnography), based on the acceptable outcomes for patients followed with watchful waiting in the CHAT trial described above. If this approach is chosen, the child should be reevaluated within six months for worsening of clinical symptoms, or reevaluated sooner if symptoms worsen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The watchful waiting approach is unlikely to be appropriate for children with severe OSA. Such patients were excluded from participation in the CHAT trial, which defined severe OSA by an apnea-hypopnea index &gt;30; an apnea index &gt;20; or &gt;2 percent of total sleep time spent with oxygen saturations &lt;90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The CHAT study also was not informative about outcomes of watchful waiting for other groups of excluded children, including those with recurrent tonsillitis, cardiovascular comorbidities, medication use for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or psychiatric disorders, body mass index (BMI) Z-score &ge;3, developmental delays requiring school accommodations, and known genetic, craniofacial, or neurological disorders likely to affect the airway, cognition, or behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other therapies</strong> &ndash; Selected children with OSA may derive benefit from adjunctive therapies. As examples, obese children with OSA may benefit from weight loss, and children with maxillary contraction may benefit from rapid maxillary expansion. In addition, nasal steroids, sinus rinses, positional therapy (eg, elevation of the head of the bed), or orthodontia can be considered. Several of these adjunctive therapies are described below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Other surgeries'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Environmental controls'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Weight loss'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Orthodontics'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Supplemental oxygen'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenotonsillectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenotonsillectomy refers to surgical resection of the tonsils and adenoids. It is generally considered first-line therapy for otherwise healthy children who have OSA and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. This topic is covered in more depth separately, but an overview is provided here because most children with obstructive sleep apnea are offered adenotonsillectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adenotonsillectomy may also be initial therapy for children with multifactorial OSA, including contributions from obesity, if appreciable adenotonsillar tissue is present. OSA in obese children usually improves following adenotonsillectomy, although the outcome may be less satisfactory than in lean children. Finally, evaluation by an otolaryngologist should still be considered in a child with OSA who does not have obvious tonsillar hypertrophy because fiber-optic nasolaryngoscopy or other tests may reveal lymphoid tissue or other causes of airway obstruction that occupy a significant proportion of the potential upper airway. </p><p>Risk factors in children who are higher risk for perioperative complications following adenotonsillectomy include severe OSA on preoperative polysomnography, or the presence of complicating factors such as obesity (especially if severe), very young age (eg, &lt;36 months), abnormal upper airway tone, or craniofacial anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103835 \">table 1</a>). Patients with these characteristics warrant additional precautions during the evaluation and performance of adenotonsillectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2865702114\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'High-risk populations'</a>.)</p><p>All children who undergo surgical therapy should follow-up with their primary care clinician or sleep specialist six to eight weeks after surgery to ensure that the symptoms or signs of OSA have resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Children who have persistent snoring or other symptoms or signs of increased upper airway resistance at this follow-up visit should also undergo polysomnography to ensure that their sleep-related breathing abnormalities have resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>]. Repeat polysomnography is also indicated for children who have had complications from OSA (eg, cor pulmonale), those with severe OSA on preoperative polysomnography, and those with craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities (including Down and Prader-Willi syndromes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H451438665\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Indications for postoperative polysomnography'</a>.)</p><p>Increased body weight, regrowth of adenotonsillar tissue, or changes in body shape due to puberty may lead to gradual reemergence of OSA months or years after adenotonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Thus, reevaluation with polysomnography is indicated later if symptoms or signs of OSA develop or worsen in a child who has a history of OSA, even if the OSA was thought to have resolved following initial therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenoidectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructive symptoms and signs frequently persist after adenoidectomy alone is performed for treatment of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. In addition, many children who undergo adenoidectomy are not spared tonsillectomy, since children who undergo adenoidectomy for the treatment of OSA are twice as likely to need eventual tonsillectomy as compared with children who undergo adenoidectomy for other indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>]. For these reasons, adenoidectomy alone is not recommended for treatment of OSA in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Conversely, some data also suggest that tonsillectomy without adenoidectomy is less effective than the combined procedure in treating pediatric OSA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other surgeries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical procedures other than adenotonsillectomy are sometimes considered to treat OSA in children without significant tonsillar hypertrophy, or with residual disease after adenotonsillectomy. These adjuvant surgical procedures may also be beneficial in patients with a high probability that OSA is due to factors other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy alone, such as in children with obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial syndromes, or neuromuscular disease. These alternative approaches include uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), supraglottoplasty, tongue reduction, tongue base procedures, expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty, lateral pharyngoplasty, and mandibular distraction osteogenesis. Tracheotomy is reserved for children with severe OSA who have failed to respond to other treatment approaches. These techniques are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2865702493\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant surgical procedures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive airway pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive airway pressure is the most common nonsurgical therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8,9,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,24,25</a>]. It involves administering airway pressure through a mask, which prevents upper airway obstruction and reduces both sleep disruption and the work of breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Positive airway pressure is a long-term therapy that requires a motivated family. Adherence to therapy is challenging, but can be optimized with proper fitting, titration, and behavioral support.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications and contraindications</strong> &ndash; CPAP and BPAP are approved for home use in children who weigh 30 kg or more; however, not all equipment manufacturers recommend use in children. CPAP and BPAP have also been safely used and well-tolerated in some children who weigh less than 30 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Positive airway pressure may not be feasible in all children, such as those with claustrophobia, although desensitization or cognitive behavioral therapy may increase successful use of CPAP or BPAP. Contraindications according to CPAP manufacturers include: &quot;bullous lung disease, pneumothorax, pneumocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid leak, recent cranial surgery or trauma, abnormalities of the cribriform plate, pathologically low blood pressure or in patients whose upper airways have been bypassed.&quot; CPAP may not be effective in patients with clinically significant hypoventilation that is due to causes other than OSA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpap-for-pediatric-obstructive-sleep-apnea#H797216072\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;CPAP for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea&quot;, section on 'Treatment decisions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CPAP versus BPAP</strong> &ndash; Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) are the usual types of positive airway pressure (BiPAP is the name of a BPAP unit manufactured by Respironics Corporation; it is just one of several commercially available machines that can deliver BPAP). CPAP applies a constant level of positive airway pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, whereas BPAP applies a higher level of positive airway pressure during inspiration than during exhalation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpap-for-pediatric-obstructive-sleep-apnea#H688825013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;CPAP for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea&quot;, section on 'The CPAP prescription'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CPAP or BPAP titration</strong> &ndash; The pressure required to treat a child's OSA is initially determined by titration during polysomnography in the sleep laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26</a>]. It is important to discuss objective adherence markers obtained from the CPAP or BPAP device with caregivers and the child, to determine adherence and identify issues for intervention to improve use. The pressure level should be periodically rechecked with repeat polysomnography, especially if there are changes in the child's clinical status (eg, recurrence of snoring despite using CPAP, recurrent daytime symptoms) or body habitus such as substantial increases or decreases in the child's weight or body mass index (BMI) percentiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, observational studies suggest that positive airway pressure improves symptoms, signs, and polysomnographic outcomes in at least 85 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8-10,26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,26,28,29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 80 children (&le;15 years old) with OSA, nasal CPAP administered at a mean pressure level of 8 cmH2O for an average of 15 months eliminated the symptoms, signs, and polysomnographic abnormalities of OSA in 90 percent of the children. The apnea-hypopnea index diminished from a mean of 27.3 to 2.6 events per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Effectiveness was defined as resolution of clinical symptoms, normal oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep, and improvement of polysomnographic abnormalities. Among the children in whom CPAP was not effective, only one had adhered to the therapy, suggesting that poor adherence was the primary reason that most children failed therapy. Approximately 75 percent of the children in the series had undergone previous adenotonsillectomy.</p><p/><p>Different modes of positive airway pressure have been directly compared. A multicenter trial randomly assigned 30 children (2 to 16 years old) with newly diagnosed OSA to receive either CPAP or BPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Ten children dropped out of the trial. Among the 20 children who completed six months of therapy, the apnea-hypopnea index fell from a mean of 27 to 3 events per hour. There were no significant differences between the CPAP and BPAP groups. A slightly larger study, which randomized children to CPAP or BPAP with pressure release technology (Bi-Flex), also showed similar findings of efficacy and adherence between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of positive airway pressure therapy are usually minor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Many are related to a suboptimal mask fit and can be avoided by regular evaluation of the mask fit (eg, every four to six months). Examples include eye irritation, conjunctivitis, skin ulceration, skin discoloration (lightening or darkening) and discomfort or irritation at the site where the mask contacts the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These problems can be minimized by proper fitting of the mask and refitting as the child grows. The mask should be fitted as loosely as possible while avoiding air leaks, to minimize the pressure on the face, because this pressure can alter facial or dental development during long-term use. Nasal complaints, such as congestion or rhinorrhea, are also common. Nasal corticosteroids or humidification of the delivered air can help relieve these symptoms. Aerophagia can occur if the child swallows air through the night resulting in bloating, burping, and passing gas in the mornings.

To minimize the problem, the technologist in the sleep laboratory should try to avoid excessive CPAP pressure during the titration.

The technique can only be used prior to midline fusion of the maxilla, which generally occurs shortly prior to puberty. RME can be used for children with OSA and narrow palate (crossbite) who have little adenotonsillar tissue, or for those with residual OSA after adenotonsillectomy.</p><p>RME involves the insertion of a metal dental appliance into the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103338\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103338 \">picture 1</a>).
