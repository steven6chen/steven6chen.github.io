In the United States and other resource-rich countries, rates of iron deficiency are substantially lower, yet iron deficiency is still common and can have important consequences to health and development.

The extent of the evaluation needed depends on the likelihood of IDA in the population and on the clinical history of the individual patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5261086\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, 7 to 9 percent of toddlers (one to three years old) have iron deficiency and 2 to 3 percent have iron deficiency anemia (IDA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100702\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100702 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The overall rate of iron deficiency in young children has declined only slightly during the past four decades, but improved markedly in some subgroups. As an example, rates of iron deficiency among children 12 to 24 months old declined from 23 to 11 percent between two study periods (1976 to 1980, and 1999 to 2002) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Rates decrease with advancing age until adolescence, when up to 16 percent of girls develop iron deficiency and 3 percent have IDA.</p><p>In the United States, the prevalence of iron deficiency is higher among children living at or below the poverty level, and in certain racial and ethnic groups. Young <span class=\"nowrap\">Hispanic/Latino</span> children have approximately double the rates of iron deficiency compared with White children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Asian children and children from families recently immigrating to the United States also have higher rates of iron deficiency. Other risk factors include low birth weight, prematurity, and childhood obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13-16</a>]. These findings demonstrate the need for ongoing surveillance and early intervention to prevent iron deficiency during infancy and early childhood, particularly among high-risk groups. </p><p>In resource-limited countries, anemia is a common public health problem. In most of Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, prevalence of anemia ranges from 45 to 65 percent in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100704 \">figure 2</a>), 20 to 60 percent in women, and 10 to 35 percent in men. From one-third to one-half of the anemia is thought to be attributable to iron deficiency, depending on the region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224100565\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron balance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron is an essential nutrient. About 75 percent is bound in the heme proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin. The remainder is bound in storage proteins such as ferritin and hemosiderin, and a small portion (3 percent) is bound in critical enzyme systems, such as catalase and cytochromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In healthy adults, only 5 percent or less of daily iron needs comes from dietary sources, and this balances the iron loss that occurs from the gastrointestinal tract; the remaining 95 percent is met by the breakdown of older red blood cells by macrophages within the reticuloendothelial system. Consequently, only a small amount of iron (approximately 1 mg) enters and leaves the body each day. However, in infants and children, 30 percent of daily iron needs must come from diet because of the rapid growth and increase in body (muscle) mass that occurs during this age range.</p><p>Iron homeostasis is primarily regulated at the site of intestinal absorption and transport, rather than urinary or fecal excretion. Absorption is regulated by the peptide hormone hepcidin, which acts primarily on ferroportin, the transmembrane protein that is found on the basolateral surface of enterocytes and is responsible for iron uptake into the plasma from the intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Serum hepcidin expression, and therefore intestinal iron absorption, is influenced by body iron stores (transferrin and ferritin), erythropoietic rate, and bioavailability of dietary iron. Low iron stores result in hepcidin suppression, allowing for enhanced iron absorption and transport by ferroportin. Conversely, normal iron status results in higher levels of hepcidin and less effective iron absorption. The steps involved in the regulation of iron metabolism are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Perinatal risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At birth, healthy term infants have iron stores of approximately 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (two-thirds of which is bound in hemoglobin), and mean hemoglobin concentrations of 15 to 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. These infants generally remain iron replete for the first five to six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Several conditions in the perinatal period can increase the risk for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) during the first three to six months of life by reducing the iron stores at birth or through other mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114485 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal iron deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal-maternal hemorrhage (FMH)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other perinatal hemorrhagic events</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prematurity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of erythropoietin (EPO) for anemia of prematurity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient dietary intake of iron during early infancy </p><p/><p>The majority of maternal-fetal iron transfer occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy. For this reason, both maternal iron deficiency during pregnancy and premature birth increase the risk of iron deficiency in the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In populations in which maternal iron deficiency is common, iron supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other strategies to reduce iron deficiency among pregnant women in low resource settings include iron fortification of whole maize flour and subsidized programs providing iron-fortified milk, noodles, or rice, or as part of a multiple micronutrient powder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. </p><p>Premature infants are at increased risk of IDA due to less maternal-fetal iron transfer, smaller total blood volume at birth, increased loss through phlebotomy, and poor gastrointestinal absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The more premature the infant, the lower their iron stores at birth. The use of erythropoietin to prevent and treat the anemia of prematurity further increases the risk for iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Therefore, some form of iron supplementation is recommended for all preterm infants. Perinatal hemorrhage (FMH or TTTS) in any infant further increases the risk for developing IDA early in infancy because the hemorrhage further reduces iron stores at birth.

In the United States, most &quot;low-iron&quot; formulas have been removed from the market, and all standard infant formulas contain at least 6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> of iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Intestinal iron absorption is dependent on the form of iron ingested (heme versus non-heme iron) and the other foods consumed at the same time. Heme dietary sources (fish, poultry, and meat) have a higher bioavailability of iron than do non-heme (vegetable) sources (30 versus 10 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83735 \">table 2</a>). Other dietary components can affect iron absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64874 \">table 3</a>). Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) enhances absorption of non-heme iron from cereal, breads, fruits, and vegetables. Conversely, absorption is inhibited by tannates (teas), bran foods rich in phosphates, and phytates (plant fiber, especially in seeds and grains) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,35-39</a>]. Therefore, children with vegan or vegetarian diets are at higher risk for iron deficiency compared with those with less restrictive diets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vegetarian-diets-for-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vegetarian diets for children&quot;, section on 'Iron'</a>.) </p><p>Early introduction of unmodified (non-formula) cow's milk during infancy is an important risk factor for IDA. Unmodified cow's milk increases intestinal blood loss in infants compared with formula or breast feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. One study of infants five to six months of age found that those who switched to cow's milk had an increase in guaiac-positive stools (3 to 30 percent) during the first 28 days, compared with only 5 percent in those receiving a cow's milk-based infant formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The mechanism may be a combination of low iron content in cow's milk and subclinical proctocolitis caused by cow's milk protein intolerance. Proctocolitis due to cow's milk protein is a common cause of overt or occult blood loss in infants, and may occur in infants who are formula-fed or breastfed. Occasionally, the proctocolitis is caused by a different dietary protein, such as soy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Excessive ingestion of cow's milk (drinking more than 24 oz [720 mL] of milk daily) in young children is also an important risk factor for iron deficiency due to the low concentration and bioavailability of iron in cow's milk. Children with excessive milk intake are also at increased risk for occult intestinal blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Patients with a severe form of this syndrome can develop a protein-losing enteropathy in which albumin and total protein are low, resulting in edema and anasarca, in addition to IDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Children with prolonged bottle-feeding have higher milk consumption and increased risk of IDA compared with those who switch to a cup. As an example, one study found that children who bottle-fed during the second and third years of life had an adjusted relative risk (RR) for iron deficiency of 2.5 (95% CI 2.46-2.53), compared with those who transitioned to cups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The progression from normal iron status to iron deficiency followed by iron-limited erythropoiesis and finally to IDA is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57739 \">table 5</a>). With iron deficiency, storage sites are depleted but there is sufficient iron in the &quot;labile&quot; iron pool from the daily turnover of red cells for normal hemoglobin synthesis, unless further iron losses occur. Anemia develops only in the final stage of iron deficiency. Conversely, when iron repletion is initiated, the anemia is the first to recover and normalization of iron stores is the final thing to fully correct. </p><p>The most common presentation of IDA is an otherwise asymptomatic, well-nourished infant or child who has a mild to moderate microcytic, hypochromic anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267 \">picture 1</a>). Much less frequent are infants with severe anemia, who present with lethargy, pallor, irritability, cardiomegaly, poor feeding, and tachypnea. However, some of these symptoms (decreased energy, mild pallor or yellow skin [nonjaundice], and pica) may not be appreciated until the improvement is seen once a child begins iron therapy. </p><p>Although IDA is typically caused by insufficient dietary iron, it is sometimes caused by an underlying medical problem resulting in gastrointestinal blood loss, malabsorption syndrome, or a chronic inflammatory disease, each of which should be assessed on history. As an example, refractory IDA can be the presenting symptom of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], <em>helicobacter pylori</em> infection (<em>H. pylori</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Iron deficiency also may be a confounding finding in children with other causes of anemia, such as hemoglobinopathies or anemia of chronic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. In particular, children with thalassemia trait may have a microcytic anemia, with or without concomitant IDA. In children with both thalassemia trait and IDA, appropriate iron therapy will improve measures of iron stores and may modestly improve the hemoglobin concentration, but a mild, microcytic anemia may persist.

On the other hand, iron supplementation may paradoxically increase the risk for certain types of infection. In particular, iron supplementation may increase the risk for bacterial infection because iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin have bacteriostatic effects, which are lost when they are saturated with iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Similarly, there is some evidence that iron supplementation results in increased susceptibility to or reactivation of dormant infections, such as malaria or tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. </p><p>The clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Some studies suggest the susceptibility to malaria is only relevant in endemic areas and high-transmission seasons; other than this group, standard doses of iron supplements do not appear to significantly increase the risk for malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/99,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,101</a>].

Furthermore, in a systematic review of randomized trials (most of which were in populations at risk for malaria and diarrheal disease), iron supplementation was associated with a higher risk of diarrhea, but had no apparent harmful effect on the incidence of malaria or other infectious illnesses in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20317306\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderately severe IDA is associated with decreased work capacity, in part because iron is an essential cofactor for enzyme-driven aerobic metabolism. Decreased iron stores, in the absence of anemia, is associated with decreased exercise performance in laboratory animals.

(See <a href=\"#H20316585\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, we suggest universal laboratory screening for IDA for children in the United States and similar populations, rather than selective screening for those with risk factors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The frequency of screening depends on patient characteristics (see <a href=\"#H20316572\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory screening'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all children &ndash; Screen once at 9 to 12 months of age. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children at high risk for IDA by dietary history (excessive cow milk intake) or prematurity &ndash; Screen a second time several months later (eg, at 15 to 18 months or when risk is identified).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with special health needs (chronic infection, inflammatory disorders, chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, restricted diets, or other significant dietary risk factors for IDA) &ndash; Repeat screening at 15 to 18 months of age, and again in early childhood (eg, at two to five years of age).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimum laboratory screening for IDA is a hemoglobin level. However, in most clinical settings, the simplest and most cost-effective measurement is a complete blood count (CBC), which will include measurements of hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW). For children with substantial risk factors for iron deficiency, measuring serum ferritin at the time of the initial screen facilitates the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H20316572\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory screening'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IDA should be suspected in children with laboratory finding of anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in children 0.5 to 5 years of age, and &lt;11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in children 5 to 12 years) (see <a href=\"#H224100551\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above). The diagnosis can be confirmed through the following additional steps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114480\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114480 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Review the history for risk factors for IDA (dietary, blood loss, or malabsorptive disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114485 \">table 1</a>), and for evidence of other causes of anemia (acute infection, chronic diseases, or family history of anemia or hemoglobinopathy). (See <a href=\"#H4055869167\" class=\"local\">'Focused history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the history is consistent with likely or possible IDA, performing a limited laboratory evaluation can confirm the diagnosis. If the presentation is typical for IDA (age &lt;3 years, with any dietary risk factors for IDA), a CBC is sufficient. Children with atypical features for IDA should have additional laboratory testing, which typically includes a reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, peripheral blood smear, and testing stools for occult blood (three samples). (See <a href=\"#H3962502766\" class=\"local\">'Selection of tests'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The combination of a hemoglobin concentration below 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> with low serum ferritin supports a provisional diagnosis of IDA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701 \">table 6</a>). MCV is typically low, and RDW elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>]. Interpretation of iron measures must account for full clinical context as most of these measures can be affected by factors other than iron status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82013 \">table 7</a>). In particular, interpretation of serum ferritin is complicated as it is an acute phase reactant, so levels may increase in states of acute or chronic inflammation. A low serum ferritin value is always consistent with iron deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3887662090\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children with presumed IDA (on the basis of history and initial laboratory testing), we suggest an empiric trial of oral iron therapy AND dietary changes rather than either intervention alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>We suggest using a dose of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of elemental iron, once daily between meals, rather than higher doses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ferrous sulfate</a> is generally effective and is tolerated by most children.
