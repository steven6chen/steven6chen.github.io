It is common, with more than 30 percent of adults and 70 percent of children and adolescents reporting at least one sunburn during the course of a year. Although most sunburns are not severe, a lifetime of sun exposure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frequent sunburns significantly increases your risk of developing skin cancer, wrinkles, and other cosmetic concerns.</p><p>This article addresses the symptoms, causes, potential complications, and treatment of sunburn. Prevention of sunburn is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sunburn prevention (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Severe sunburns are treated like other skin burns and are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-burns-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Skin burns (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). More detailed information about sunburn is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sunburn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SUNBURN SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike other types of skin burns, sunburn may not be immediately apparent because redness starts to develop between three and five hours after being out in the sun. Common symptoms of sunburn include reddened skin that is hot to the touch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71537\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71537 \">picture 1</a>), skin pain, and increased sensitivity to skin pressure and heat (eg, hot water); more severe sunburns cause skin swelling and blistering (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-burns-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Skin burns (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). The sunburn damage in the skin also triggers skin tanning. It is a well-known fact that tanning is the body's response to damage to the skin cells.</p><p>Redness peaks approximately 12 to 24 hours after sun exposure and typically fades over 72 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SUNBURN CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, the skin is protected from the sun by a substance in the skin called melanin. Melanin is a pigment (coloring) that causes your skin to appear light or dark colored. If your skin is exposed to excessive ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun or a tanning bed, it becomes burned.</p><p>The amount of UVR required to burn your skin depends upon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of melanin in your skin. In general, people with fair skin and light-colored hair have less melanin and are at a higher risk of sunburn compared with people with darker-colored skin. Some people can develop sunburn after less than 15 minutes of sun exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where you are. People in regions that are closest to the equator and high altitudes (eg, mountainous areas) are at a higher risk for developing sunburn. Take extra precautions when you are exposed to a breeze (eg, sailing) because this masks the heat of the sun, which is a good guide to the intensity of UVR. Also remember that snow reflects UVR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medications make the skin more sensitive to sunburn. This includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen), quinolone and tetracycline antibiotics (eg, Ciprofloxacin, tetracycline), diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), psoralens <span class=\"nowrap\">(methoxsalen/Oxsoralen),</span> and phenothiazines (eg, Compazine). Other drugs include amiodarone and antifungals, including voriconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole. If you take one or more of these medications, you should avoid the sun and use protective measures (eg, sunscreen) to avoid sunburn.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SUNBURN COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sunburn is associated with premature skin aging (eg, wrinkling of the skin) as well as skin cancer, including malignant melanoma, a very serious form of skin cancer. Sun exposure and ultraviolet radiation damage can also increase the risk of developing cataracts (when the lens in the eye becomes cloudy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melanoma-treatment-localized-melanoma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Melanoma treatment; localized melanoma (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUNBURN TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for sunburn can help to relieve skin discomfort. You should stay out of the sun until your skin redness and pain resolve. You can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen to relieve pain. These medications are especially helpful if you take them as soon as you notice pain; the benefit of NSAIDs decreases after 24 hours. However, it is important to bear in mind that you need to be careful about going in the sun afterwards.</p><p>For mild sunburns, there are a number of products advertised to relieve pain, including cool compresses, aloe-based lotions, and lotions or sprays with a local anesthetic (numbing medication, eg, Solarcaine, Dermoplast). Although studies have not proven that these products are helpful, they are not likely to be harmful. However, these products do not reduce the long-term risks of sunburn (eg, skin cancer).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTING SUNBURN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevention of sunburn is discussed in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sunburn prevention (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a severe sunburn, call your health care provider to determine if you can use treatment at home or if you need to be evaluated in the office or an emergency department.</p><p>Symptoms of severe sunburn include severe skin pain and skin blistering. People with severe sunburn can also have heat stroke or heat exhaustion (when your body temperature is extremely high), which can cause fever, headache, confusion, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and fainting. If you have any of these problems, you should go to the emergency department immediately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/table-of-contents/patient-education&amp;token=MemwQD5e0y08+nTQP4u1xRY1G5tCZBD7GvbhToZxPCAQgIQSs2cP7qdUEevEDZGG4fhY6LmOoitvaJrvH6N6InnASXkbeDx+zs4g9cKsqt0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2730\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/contents/table-of-contents/patient-education</a>).
