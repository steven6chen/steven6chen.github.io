Bladder pain syndrome is often called &quot;BPS&quot; for short. It is also sometimes called &quot;painful bladder syndrome&quot; or &quot;interstitial cystitis.&quot;</p><p>BPS can happen in men or women, but it is more common in women. Doctors do not know what causes BPS, but some doctors suspect it might be caused by abnormal changes in the lining of the bladder. Sometimes, BPS happens on its own. Other times, it starts after a person has:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection of the urinary tract, vagina, or prostate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery on the bladder, pelvis, or back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An injury to the pelvic area or buttocks</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24555610\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of BPS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All people with BPS have bladder pain that gets better after urinating. Other common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like you need to urinate often during the day and night (even if you don't actually urinate)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating often during the day and night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having pain in the lower belly or around the area where urine leaves the body</p><p/><p>Symptoms of BPS are different from person to person and can be mild or severe. People might not have symptoms every day. But they can have &quot;flares,&quot; which are times when their symptoms get worse. Some people find that their symptoms get worse at certain times, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After they have certain foods or drinks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During certain times of their monthly cycle (in women)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After having sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After sitting for a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During times of stress</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24555617\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for BPS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no one test to check for BPS. But if you have BPS symptoms, your doctor or nurse will talk with you, might do an exam, and will probably do a urine test. Depending on the results, your doctor might do other tests, too.</p><p>For example, some people have a test called &quot;cystoscopy.&quot; During cystoscopy, a doctor puts a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end into the opening in the body where urine comes out (called the urethra). Then he or she advances the tube until it reaches the bladder. That way the doctor can look at the inside of the bladder to see if it is abnormal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24555624\"><span class=\"h1\">How is BPS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are different treatments for BPS. Most people need more than one treatment. Different treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder training &ndash; You can train your bladder to urinate less often by holding your urine for longer periods of time. For example, if you feel the need to urinate every 30 minutes, try to wait and urinate every 45 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy &ndash; Many people with BPS have tight and painful muscles in the lower belly, groin, and buttocks. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to help relax these muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Doctors can use different medicines to treat BPS. Some medicines help heal the bladder lining, and others can reduce pain. Some medicines come as pills. Others come as liquids and go into the bladder through a tube that is put up the urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A person might have surgery if he or she still has symptoms after trying all other treatments. During surgery, a doctor puts a small device in the lower back that connects to the nerve that goes to the bladder. The device sends electrical signals to the nerve that can stop it from feeling pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24555631\"><span class=\"h1\">Can BPS flares be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help prevent flares, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid the foods and drinks that make your symptoms worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid activities that make your symptoms worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get treated quickly for bladder infections, which can make BPS symptoms worse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24555638\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have long-term pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have long-term pain, talk with your doctor or nurse about what you can do. Some people find it helpful to work with a mental health expert or join a support group for people with BPS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24555645\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
