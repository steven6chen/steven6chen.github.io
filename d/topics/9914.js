The long-term goals of therapy in patients who have already experienced signs and symptoms of the disease (established or prevalent gout) are to prevent recurrent gout flares and to reverse prior signs of the disease by achieving and maintaining subsaturating serum urate concentrations. This is achieved by a combination of approaches, including lifestyle modification and other strategies for risk reduction, as well as urate-lowering drug therapy.</p><p>The prevention of gout flares and disease progression in people with gout by nonpharmacologic lifestyle modifications for urate lowering and by risk reduction involving drug choices for management of comorbid diseases (eg, hypertension) will be reviewed here. Treatment with urate-lowering drugs, the role of surgery for treating tophi, the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout, the prophylaxis and treatment of episodes of acute gouty arthritis, and issues related to asymptomatic hyperuricemia are discussed separately.

This is accomplished by achieving and maintaining subsaturating serum urate concentrations because the symptoms and signs of gout do not occur in the absence of urate saturation of extracellular fluids, reflected by elevated serum urate concentrations, and urate crystal deposition in tissues and inflammatory responses to such crystal deposition. Moreover, there is no evidence that serum urate reduction to levels that remain above the limit of solubility carries with it clinical benefits equivalent to those achievable at sustained subsaturating levels.</p><p>Management for the prevention of recurrent gout flares and damage to joints and other tissues from urate crystal deposition includes urate-lowering drug therapy, lifestyle modification, and other strategies for risk reduction. Long-term success in maintaining subsaturating urate levels results in clinical benefits that include cessation of gout flares, resolution of tophi, and improvement in patient physical function and health-related quality of life. However, resolution of the urate crystal burden in patients with established gout may require many months to several years to attain, even after subsaturating serum urate levels are achieved. During this period of crystal dissolution, a risk for acute flare remains and is the primary basis for gout flare prophylaxis with antiinflammatory agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529065911\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upon resolution of an acute gouty attack, the patient is said to have entered an intercritical (between attacks) period (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout#H56519131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;, section on 'Intercritical gout and recurrent gout flares'</a>); during this period, the following issues relevant to prevention of gout flares and disease progression should be addressed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education regarding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The basis of gouty symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Factors likely to provoke flare recurrence or disease progression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rationale for each component of the recommended therapeutic plan and the benefits and potential harms of each of these components</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thorough patient education is an element essential to successful adherence to both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Hyperuricemia, in turn, has multiple antecedents; these include other clinical disorders, genetic mutations and polymorphisms, and dietary, drug, and toxin exposures, which result in either urate overproduction or, more commonly, impaired urate disposal or a combination of these aberrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 3</a>).

In this instance, they may reduce the dose of urate-lowering medication formerly needed to <span class=\"nowrap\">achieve/maintain</span> goal serum urate levels (or occasionally replace the need for medication) and encourage patient adherence to management of the comorbidities common among patients with gout.</p><p>Urate-lowering pharmacotherapy for gout is, by definition, aimed directly at reversing hyperuricemia and thus alleviating the risk of urate crystal formation and deposition and the ensuing inflammatory and degenerative consequences. When indicated, it should be initiated as definitive therapy for patients with established gout, as long as it is tolerable to the patient and that subsaturating urate levels are reached and maintained within approved dosing limits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/1,3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-8</a>].</p><p>Importantly, there are examples of apparent modifiers of incident gout risk that have not shown efficacy in risk reduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> practicality in patients with established gout that is sufficient to support their routine therapeutic use. For this reason, we will describe here, where relevant, whether sufficient evidence for clinical benefit (relative to risk) has been demonstrated, in our view, to justify incorporating particular candidate risk-reduction initiatives in the care of patients with established gout.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1471483312\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of risk-reduction strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of investigative approaches have been taken to assess the benefits of lifestyle modifications and other nonpharmacologic strategies for reducing the risk of gout. In one category are prospective or comparative cohort investigations that have identified risks for incident (&quot;new&quot;) gout, usually in large, previously non-gouty general populations or populations with specific comorbidities that are closely associated with gout. The other category includes smaller randomized trials or case-crossover trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], in which candidate risk-influencing initiatives have been tested as means to trigger or suppress disease expression; these are typically performed in patients with established or prevalent gout. Both approaches have provided important information relevant to established gout risk.</p><p>Prospective cohort studies have identified candidate initiatives for testing in patients with established gout (as well as in primary prevention of gout). Randomized controlled and online crossover trials are particularly useful in confirming if specific agents or actions (including lifestyle measures, dietary additions or deletions, or pharmacologic management of accompanying comorbidities) can alter the course of established gout.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28466972\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF COMORBIDITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight reduction towards ideal body weight and moderation in ethanol consumption have each been convincingly shown to reduce both the risk of incident gout and the expression of established gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Other comorbidities have also been the subject of study.</p><p>Hyperuricemia and gout are frequently accompanied by one or more major disorders, such as hypertension, obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which are components of the metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]; cardiovascular disease; chronic renal functional impairment; and excessive alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/10,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20</a>]. These associations have raised the question of whether lifestyle and pharmacologic (or even surgical) strategies aimed at treatment of one or more of these comorbidities might suffice to reduce the risk of incident gout <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the progression of established gout.</p><p>The strongest evidence that this is the case in prevalent as well as incident gout is provided by the results of weight reduction toward ideal body weight in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/18,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21-24</a>] and of moderation in ethanol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].

Findings noted in the systematic review included beneficial effects of weight loss on serum urate levels, achievement of serum urate target, and reduction in gout attacks. In patients who underwent bariatric surgery, increased rates of unfavorable gouty events were noted only in the immediate postoperative period. The studies identified were clinically heterogeneous and involved several different interventions, thus limiting the strength of the evidence and precluding meta-analysis. Given the limitations of the available data, additional prospective trials would be helpful.</p><p>As an example of such studies, the benefit of weight loss in reducing the risk for incident gout was illustrated in the 12-year Health Professionals Follow-up Study that monitored a prospective cohort of 47,150 men with no history of gout at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The risk of incident gout was higher in men with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or greater, and the magnitude of the association became larger with increasing BMI. Men who had gained 13.6 kg or more had a twofold increased risk of incident gout compared with men who maintained their weight, while weight loss greater than 4.5 kg was associated with a reduced risk of incident gout.</p><p>In addition, impressive results have been associated with profound weight loss in controlled trials of patients undergoing bariatric surgery for severe obesity, usually in combination with one or more commonly accompanying features of the metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24</a>]. Findings include improvement in several aspects of impaired metabolic regulation, including hyperuricemia, with clinical benefit in patients with established as well as incident gout. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced frequency of incident gout, compared with a control group who did not undergo such surgery, in a prospective interventional trial involving nearly 4000 obese (BMI &ge;34 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> but non-gouty patients in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Participants undergoing bariatric surgery were matched for demographic and comorbid features with a non-operated control group receiving a range of standard obesity treatments. At two-year follow-up, BMI had decreased by 24 percent in the surgery group, with no change in the control group; at 10-year follow-up, the corresponding changes from baseline BMI were -17 and +2 percent for the respective groups. Bariatric surgery was associated with less frequent incident gout over the 26-year follow-up period (138 surgically treated patients versus 201 patients in the control group; after multivariable adjustment, hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.75). Age, creatinine levels, serum urate &ge;6.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> use of medications associated with increased gout risk, and alcohol intake at baseline were all associated with an increased risk for incident gout.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least two studies have supported the view that the weight loss associated with bariatric surgery has beneficial, clinically important effects in patients with established gout:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In one study, bariatric surgery reduced serum urate and rates of gout flares in patients with established gout. In this study, which involved 60 patients in New Zealand with BMI &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> and type 2 diabetes, of whom 12 had established gout and 48 were without gout, all patients completed an initial dietary intervention for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This resulted in a mean weight loss of 5.5 kg but no change in serum urate from baseline. All patients then underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, with a further one-year follow-up, during which serum urate levels were serially measured.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In the first postoperative month, serum urate levels and rates of gout flare increased in both gouty and non-gouty patient groups, but thereafter diminished to values at one year that were lower than at baseline. Serum urate levels at time of surgery exceeded saturation in 10 of the 12 patients with established gout, but at one year after surgery the corresponding proportion was only 3 of 12. The study identified clinically relevant reductions in serum urate after bariatric surgery in gouty and non-gouty people with diabetes and World Health Organization (WHO) class II or higher obesity; baseline serum urate, cessation of diuretics, and female sex all independently predicted change in the serum urate at the final visit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Similarly, in another study, involving morbidly obese patients with established gout, the effects of bariatric surgery (in 99 patients) on the course of the disease were compared with the effects of non-bariatric upper abdominal surgery (the control group, including 56 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The incidence of gout flares was significantly higher among the bariatric surgery patients compared with the controls during the first postoperative month (18 versus 2 percent). However, in the bariatric surgery group, compared with the month prior to surgery, gout flares were reduced during postoperative months 1 to 13 (from 24 to 8 percent), while they were unchanged in the non-bariatric surgical group. In addition, the mean serum urate level decreased from a baseline of 9.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> to a value of 5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> at 13 months after bariatric surgery.</p><p/><p>In addition to weight loss itself, dietary composition and its modification can also influence serum urate; modifying the dietary composition in a fashion that may be best for reducing serum urate is also a goal (see <a href=\"#H2218540968\" class=\"local\">'Dietary composition'</a> below).

Early recognition of the presence of crystals of urate, the end product of human purine metabolism, in gouty lesions prompted recommendation of severely purine-restricted diets for patients with gout prior to the availability of urate-lowering pharmacotherapy.

Low-fat dairy has also been found to reduce incident gout, but reduced gouty attacks in patients with established gout have not been demonstrated.</p><p>Despite the lack of evidence for benefit from changes in dietary protein content on the course of prevalent (ie, established) gout, published guidelines for management of patients with prevalent gout continue to recommend increased low-fat dairy and reduced meat and seafood intake in patients with established gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/1,3,4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,7,8</a>]. In light of the apparent benefit of these dietary changes in comorbidities common among gout patients (eg, hypertension), it is our view that these recommendations are appropriate for overweight patients with established gout as long as they are well tolerated, readily available to patients, and recognized as being of uncertain benefit with regard to mitigation of established gout, in contrast to their likely benefit in the prevention of incident gout.</p><p>The association of increasing meat and seafood intake with gout is well illustrated in the prospective observational study of 47,150 male health professionals without a history of gout at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In two Chinese populations in Singapore, total protein intake mainly from poultry, fish, and shellfish was associated with an increased risk of incident gout, but protein intake largely from soy and legumes was associated with a reduced risk.</p><p>The evidence also suggests that ingestion of dairy products reduces incident gout. In contrast to meat and seafood intake, the highest quintile of dairy product consumption was associated with a nearly 50 percent reduction in incident gout risk compared with the lowest quintile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

For both control and hazard periods, patients were assessed for the extent of cherry use, trigger factors for flare (including diet, alcohol use, purine intake, diuretic use, infections, injuries, anti-gout medication use), and characteristics of the flare. The design of crossover studies of this type and the timing of exposure measurements in relation to gout attacks permit each patient to serve as their own control, thus eliminating potentially confounding risk factors that are constant within an individual but would differ among study subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the trial, 42 percent of study participants reported using cherries in their diets, the great majority as fresh cherry fruit rather than cherry extract.

Complete clinical remission often requires many months to several years to achieve, due to the slow reduction in the body urate crystal burden that has accumulated in most patients over years of hyperuricemia preceding the onset of gout.

(See <a href=\"#H2565212696\" class=\"local\">'Specific dietary products providing potential gout benefit or increased risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1015801285\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4109374883\" class=\"local\">'Dietary triggers of gout flares'</a> above and <a href=\"#H529065911\" class=\"local\">'Management principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2650547312\" class=\"local\">'Whole diet approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with established gout who imbibe alcohol in low-risk or moderate amounts (eg, one to two drinks of beer, spirits, or wine daily or less frequently but in binge fashion), we describe the link of chronic intake or acute excesses of beer, spirits, or wine to the risks for gout flare and disease progression, and we counsel reduction in alcohol intake. In patients with established gout maintaining goal range serum urate levels on pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy, small amounts of alcohol intake are unlikely to trigger flares or promote disease progression. We instruct all patients, with gout or otherwise, who report imbibing hazardous amounts of alcoholic beverages about the inherent dangers to their health and the well-being of themselves and others, stress the need for cessation of or moderation in alcohol use, and offer to direct them to social and professional assistance in doing so. (See <a href=\"#H1015801285\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary hypertension (essential hypertension) and diuretic use are each independently associated with hyperuricemia and gout. Patients with hypertension who become hyperuricemic or experience gout flares while being treated with thiazide diuretics should switch to another antihypertensive drug only if hypertension can be easily controlled by another agent and if cost is not a significant issue. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Losartan</a> has modest uricosuric effects, unique among angiotensin II receptor blockers, and may be an alternative to a diuretic. Other antihypertension therapies have effects on serum urate levels and risk of incident gout; loop (but not potassium-sparing) diuretics and beta-blockers increase and calcium channel blockers decrease urate levels. (See <a href=\"#H355236724\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension and diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (75 to 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> administered for cardiovascular prophylaxis increases serum urate levels and rates of gout flares in patients with prevalent gout. Monitoring of urate levels prior to low-dose aspirin treatment and in the course of treatment with aspirin is thus advised for patients receiving low-dose aspirin. Discontinuation of low-dose aspirin therapy is generally not necessary in patients requiring cardiovascular prophylaxis because urate-lowering pharmacotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a> reverses the risk for recurrent gout flare in aspirin-treated patients, and gout flare is unlikely to be an early adverse consequence of low-dose aspirin treatment in patients who are not hyperuricemic prior to aspirin treatment.
