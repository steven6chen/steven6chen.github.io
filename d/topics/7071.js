This includes avoidance of incompletely digested sugars (eg, fructose, lactose) and caffeine. Patients should be advised to keep a food and symptom diary to identify factors that cause diarrhea and incontinence. The anoderm should be kept clean and dry, without excessive wiping or use of astringent cleaners. Alternatively, a premoistened pad or tissue can be used for wiping. We suggest application of a barrier cream (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a>) to the perianal skin. Incontinence pads can be used to protect both skin and clothing from fecal soiling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

No specific medication has been proven to be of benefit for fecal incontinence, except for antidiarrheal drugs in patients with liquid stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We begin by supplementing the diet with a bulking agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a> 1 to 2 tablespoons per day) to improve stool consistency, especially in patients who have low-volume, loose stools. However, fiber may exacerbate incontinence in patients with decreased rectal compliance by increasing stool volume (eg, radiation proctitis, rectal stricture). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with diarrhea, it is important to treat the underlying etiology. In addition, we use the antidiarrheal agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> to reduce fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A systematic review of medical therapy for fecal incontinence identified 16 randomized studies with 558 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In four randomized trials in which loperamide or diphenoxylate plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> was compared with placebo, use of these antidiarrheals resulted in a reduction in fecal urgency, episodes of incontinence, unformed stools, and use of pads. Anorectal physiological measurements showed no clear differences between treatment periods. As compared with diphenoxylate, loperamide may be more effective at reducing urgency associated with incontinence and has fewer central nervous system side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with fecal impaction should be disimpacted, and concomitant constipation should be treated to prevent recurrent episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

An effect on anal pressures has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, there are limited data to support biofeedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although some studies have reported success rates between 38 and 100 percent, these studies have been small, have lacked a control group, have defined endpoints differently, or have had significant other methodological limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/15,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H382786609\"><span class=\"h2\">Injectable anal bulking agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the injectable anal bulking agent, dextranomer stabilized in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, in patients with passive fecal incontinence. It is hypothesized that injection of anal bulking agents may enhance resting anal pressures and thereby improve fecal continence, especially in patients with passive fecal incontinence.

After six months of follow-up, 71 of 136 (52 percent) patients in the active treatment arm reported a 50 percent or greater reduction in incontinence episodes, compared with 22 of 70 patients (32 percent) in the sham arm. Complications included proctalgia, rectal hemorrhage, and an abscess (14, 7, and 1 percent, respectively). No significant improvements between active and sham patients were noted in three of the four parts of the fecal incontinence quality of life scale (lifestyle, depression and self-perception, and embarrassment scales), and only a small improvement was noted in the coping and behavior scale. Only 6 percent of treated patients were fully continent at six months. A limitation of the study was that patients were not characterized clinically as to whether they had urge or passive incontinence or manometrically. The limited efficacy of dextranomer-hyaluronic acid in this study may be due to the inclusion of patients with urge incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

It involves placement of a temporary electrode into the sacral foramen to provide low-grade electrical stimulation. Patients who respond to a two-week trial then undergo placement of a permanent electrode connected subcutaneously to an embedded stimulator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/35,36,40-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36,40-48</a>].</p><p>Sacral nerve stimulation may improve fecal continence by improving resting and squeeze pressures of the anal sphincter, rectal sensation, and increasing retrograde colonic propagating sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/44,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,49,50</a>]. Although studies have demonstrated an improvement in fecal continence with sacral nerve stimulation, a significant number of patients will require surgical revision following stimulator implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/36,42,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,42,51</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial that included 120 patients with fecal incontinence, patients were assigned to sacral nerve stimulation or optimal medical therapy consisting of pelvic floor exercises, bulking agents, and dietary changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Anal incontinence is defined as the involuntary loss of solid or liquid feces or flatus. Fecal urge incontinence is characterized by the desire to defecate, but incontinence occurs despite efforts to retain stool. Passive fecal incontinence is characterized by the lack of awareness of the need to defecate before the incontinent episode. (See <a href=\"#H1163369030\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management of fecal incontinence consists of supportive care and medical therapy. Supportive care includes avoiding foods or activities known to worsen symptoms and maintenance of perianal skin hygiene. We suggest a bulking agent and antidiarrheals in patients with fecal incontinence due to diarrhea (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H898962499\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a gastroenterologist should be considered in patients who fail to respond to initial management. Such patients should undergo additional evaluation (eg, anorectal manometry, endorectal <span class=\"nowrap\">ultrasound/magnetic</span> resonance imaging) to detect functional and structural abnormalities causing fecal incontinence and to guide subsequent management. (See <a href=\"#H909133872\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail to respond to initial management, options include biofeedback, injectable anal bulking agent, sacral nerve stimulation, and anal sphincteroplasty. Biofeedback therapy for fecal incontinence should only be considered in patients with manometric evidence of weakness of the external anal sphincter or decreased ability to perceive rectal distension because of nerve injury. We reserve anal injections of dextranomer stabilized in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> for patients with passive fecal incontinence and anal sphincteroplasty for patients who have a recognized anatomic sphincter injury shortly after vaginal delivery. We reserve sacral nerve stimulation for patients who are either not candidates for injectable anal bulking agents or sphincteroplasty or in whom they have failed. (See <a href=\"#H1163369599\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dynamic graciloplasty and artificial anal sphincter devices are associated with significant morbidity and should therefore only be used to treat refractory fecal incontinence. Fecal diversion with a colostomy should be reserved for patients with intractable symptoms who are not candidates for any other therapy, or in whom other treatments have failed. (See <a href=\"#H294472365\" class=\"local\">'Refractory symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Nelson R, Norton N, Cautley E, Furner S.
