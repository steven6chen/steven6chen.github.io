It is usually caused by an immune-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes is called type 1A to distinguish it from some rarer cases in which an autoimmune etiology cannot be determined (type 1B); the latter are said to be idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The term type 1 diabetes used here refers to type 1A, or autoimmune diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic</strong> &ndash; Type 1 diabetes occurs in genetically susceptible subjects. It is a polygenic disease with a small number of genes having large effects, (ie, human leukocyte antigen [HLA]) and a large number of genes having small effects. Risk of type 1 diabetes progression is conferred by specific HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">DR/DQ</span> alleles (eg, DRB1*03-DQB1*0201 [DR3] or DRB1*04-DQB1*0302 [DR4]). In addition, HLA alleles such as DQB1*0602 are associated with dominant protection from disease in multiple populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Genetic markers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunologic</strong> &ndash; Similar to the majority of autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes usually has a relapsing, remitting disease course with autoantibody and T cellular responses to islet autoantigens that precede the clinical onset of the disease process. The immunologic diagnosis of autoimmune diseases relies primarily on the detection of autoantibodies directed to islet autoantigens in the serum of type 1 diabetic patients. Although their pathogenic significance remains uncertain, they have the practical advantage of serving as surrogate biomarkers for predicting the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic markers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Natural history</strong> &ndash; Type 1 diabetes is probably triggered by one or more environmental agents and usually progresses over many months or years, during most of which the subject is asymptomatic and euglycemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66417 \">figure 2</a>). A large percentage of the functioning beta cells are lost before hyperglycemia appears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rate of progression of the immune injury is highly variable, even among high-risk subjects who have one or more of the relevant serum autoantibodies. In some subjects, as an example, progression is so slow that diabetes does not occur for many years or perhaps ever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. These subjects presumably regain tolerance in some way, eg, regulatory T cells (Tregs) become more numerous or helper T cells become less numerous or active. One report described a 10-year follow-up in 18 nondiabetic twins of type 1 diabetes probands; the eight twins who developed diabetes had persistently high numbers of CD8 HLA DR+ T cells, whereas the 10 twins who remained euglycemic did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice that do not develop diabetes have Tregs that suppress autoimmune destruction of the islets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, suppression of insulitis and protection from the development of diabetes can be achieved by injecting insulin-reactive CD4 T cell clones from mice that do not develop diabetes into mice that would otherwise have developed diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This variability in progression of injury causes a major therapeutic dilemma with respect to intervention during the preclinical period. Early therapy is likely to preserve more beta cells but may also result in some patients being treated unnecessarily. There is also concern that treatment of a subject in whom the disease is not progressing might increase the risk of type 1 diabetes by disrupting the balance between helper and suppressor activity, a sequence that has been demonstrated in BioBreeding (BB) rats and NOD mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, delaying therapy runs the risk that fewer beta cells will be left to preserve.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANIMAL MODELS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of two animal models of type 1 diabetes has made it possible to evaluate plausible therapeutic strategies before starting human trials. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and BioBreeding (BB) rats are inbred strains that spontaneously develop autoimmune insulitis and diabetes with striking similarities to type 1 diabetes in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes in these animals is high, and the onset of insulitis as well as hyperglycemia can be readily detected. Several interventions have been tested in these animals, often at a very early stage in the autoimmune disease process before the onset of insulitis. Examples include subcutaneous and oral insulin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicotinamide-niacinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicotinamide</a>, and the beta cell antigen glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Of note, many interventions have been effective in the murine models when applied before the development of hyperglycemia; however, very few interventions have reversed established diabetes.</p><p>Strategies for prevention or reversal of diabetes in animal models and in humans are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF MARKERS TO PREDICT TYPE 1 DIABETES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many immune-mediated disorders, including certain endocrine syndromes, are genetically associated with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, and several hypotheses have been suggested to explain HLA disease associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Some HLA-associated diseases have been linked with polymorphisms of the genes encoding the class II molecule. One typical example is type 1 diabetes. Genetic markers may be helpful in assessing the risk of type 1 diabetes in relatives of a patient with type 1 diabetes. The risk is markedly increased in these relatives, averaging at approximately 6 percent in offspring and 5 percent in siblings (versus 0.4 percent in subjects with no family history) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The risk in siblings is importantly influenced by the degree of genetic similarity, falling from 33 percent in identical twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] to 12.9 to 4.5 to 1.8 percent, respectively, if the siblings share two, one, or no haplotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The major susceptibility genes for type 1 diabetes are in the HLA region on chromosome 6p [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Over 90 percent of patients with type 1 diabetes carry DR4, DQB*0302, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DR3, DQB*0201. Thus, if the proband is heterozygous for DR3 and DR4 (the highest risk combination), the incidence of type 1 diabetes in a sibling who shares these two haplotypes rises to 19 percent. On the other hand, the absence of the above alleles makes type 1 diabetes very unlikely, especially if the subject carries a protective allele such as DQB*0301, *0602 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], DRB*0403, or *0406 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combined effect of susceptibility or protective alleles and the presence or absence of a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74366\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74366 \">table 1</a>). Use of genetic markers plus the family history make it possible to estimate the risk of type 1 diabetes as being as low as 1 in 5000 (no susceptibility alleles or family history) to as high as one in four (two susceptibility alleles and a positive family history). However, the prevalence of the HLA susceptibility genes is relatively high in whites. As a result, the predictive value of HLA typing is much lower in population screening than it is among families in which one or more members have type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In one study, the risk for islet autoimmunity drastically increased in <span class=\"nowrap\">DR3/4-DQ2/DQ8</span> siblings who shared both HLA haplotypes identical by descent with their diabetic proband sibling (63 and 85 percent by ages 7 and 15, respectively) as compared with siblings who did not share both HLA haplotypes with their diabetic proband sibling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These data suggest that HLA genotyping at birth may identify individuals at very high risk of developing type 1 diabetes before the occurrence of clear signs of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes onset. Rapid automated assays make it possible to do large-scale population screening for HLA easily, even in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>In general, the additional measurement of 2 HLA-DQ high-risk haplotypes does not increase the predictive value of combined autoantibody assays. However, in relatives who are seronegative for conventional islet autoantibodies, the presence of two HLA-DQ high-risk haplotypes is associated with an increased risk of progression to type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This observation suggests that unidentified autoimmune phenomena may be present in seronegative relatives who carry the 2 HLA-DQ high-risk haplotypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic markers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Islet autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinically useful serum autoantibodies can be detected during the preclinical phase of type 1 diabetes, including islet cell antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), antibodies to tyrosine phosphatase-like proteins such as insulinoma-associated protein (IA-2, ICA512) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and antibodies to the zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The measurement of islet autoantibodies is a prerequisite in screening for individuals at risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The presence of two or more of these islet autoantibodies is being used as entry criteria for type 1 diabetes prevention trials such as those supported by the <a href=\"http://www.diabetestrialnet.org/&amp;token=vt/p3FFwGt2EhhovKxjmBsdCl+yE/pABUudxDDRwVnA1O1jX/PampQMCzlCvt97d&amp;TOPIC_ID=1791\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">TrialNet</a> network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Children with the earliest evidence of autoimmunity are at greatest risk for and progress more quickly to the development of type 1 diabetes. Periodic testing for islet autoantibodies appears to help assess the risk of diabetes in children of parents with type 1 diabetes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of type 1 diabetes</strong> &ndash; In several prospective family studies (including the large combined data set of the Islet Cell Antibody Registry Users Study [ICARUS]) in which unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes were followed, the presence of ICA was associated with an increased risk of diabetes, particularly if the ICA titer was high, ICA were persistently detected, or ICA were present in combination with IAA or GAD antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar findings have been reported with IA-2. In one study of first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetic probands, those with IA-2 autoantibodies in the upper three quartiles were at higher risk than relatives with an IA-2 autoantibody titer in the lowest quartile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In another study, an autoantibody response directed to the extracellular domain of IA-2 was associated with very high risk of type 1 diabetes progression, suggesting the presence of new antigenic determinants within the extracellular domain of IA-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This has considerable implications not only for stratifying high type 1 diabetes risk, but also to facilitate the search for pathogenic epitopes to enable the design of peptide-based immunotherapies, which may prevent the progression to overt type 1 diabetes at its preclinical stages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unlike nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, humans exhibit any combination of ICA, IAA, GAD, and IA-2 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31,32</a>]. The risk of type 1 diabetes is relatively low with IAA alone but is higher with the presence of multiple autoantibodies against islet antigens (insulin, GAD, IA-2 and ICA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23,28,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,33-35</a>]. Antibodies to GAD are predictive of progression to hyperglycemia even in the absence of ICA or IAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As with IAA, however, the risk is higher in subjects who are ICA positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Time to progression</strong> &ndash; The titer of IAA has been used to predict the time to onset of type 1 diabetes, particularly in children younger than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a prospective cohort study of 1353 offspring of parents with type 1 diabetes, antibodies detected in the first six months were derived by placental transfer from the mother. Autoantibodies began to appear by nine months and frequently persisted. IAA were almost always the first to appear, with other antibodies (ICA, GAD, or IA-2) appearing later. By age five years, nine (1.8 percent) children had developed type 1 diabetes, and all had one or more autoantibodies beforehand. Fifty percent of children who had two or more antibodies present by two years had diabetes by age five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In a follow-up report of a slightly larger cohort (1610 offspring), the following results were seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By age five years, the frequencies of islet autoantibodies, multiple autoantibodies, and type 1 diabetes were 5.9, 3.5, and 1.5 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of diabetes was highest in those with multiple autoantibodies (40 percent within five years versus 3 percent in those with single autoantibodies).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Progression to multiple islet autoantibodies was fastest in children who developed their first autoantibody by age two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of progression to diabetes was inversely related to the age of positivity for multiple islet autoantibodies (50 percent of children who had multiple positivity before age nine months developed diabetes within two years, compared with 7 percent in those who had multiple autoantibodies at age five years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another study of 81 Swedish children who later developed type 1 diabetes, 14 (17 percent) had at least one autoantibody present at birth (either GAD, IAA, or ICA512), as compared with 12 of 320 (4 percent) control children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

In first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes, for example, an FPIR below the first percentile of normal is a strong predictor of type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In the Diabetes Prevention Trial of Type 1 Diabetes (DPT-1), subjects at high risk for developing diabetes were followed with serial IVGTTs and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), and in a subsequent study, the metabolic factors associated with progression to diabetes were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Abnormalities of FPIR and two-hour glucose during OGTT had similar sensitivities for diabetes prediction within six months of diagnosis (76 percent for OGTT [95% CI 60-83 percent] and 73 percent for FPIR [95% CI 60-83 percent]). Sensitivity was better when both tests were performed, and the vast majority of these individuals (97 percent) had abnormal IVGTTs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> OGTTs before the development of the overt diabetes. In contrast, fasting blood glucose levels were a poor predictor of diabetes.</p><p>A simpler test that may prove useful is to measure the fasting serum concentration of proinsulin, the precursor of insulin. In normal subjects, proinsulin accounts for approximately 15 percent of serum immunoreactive insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This proportion rises as beta cell function declines. One report, as an example, found that serum proinsulin concentrations were three to four times higher among ICA-positive relatives of type 1 diabetes patients as compared with ICA-negative relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, prospective studies are needed to determine whether elevated serum proinsulin values will help in predicting the development of type 1 diabetes.</p><p>The use of the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 Risk Score (DPTRS) may improve risk classification accuracy for type 1 diabetes by identifying high-risk normoglycemic and low-risk dysglycemic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

As a result, many patients with type 1 diabetes (or their parents) ask their doctors about screening of other family members (particularly children) and what could be done if the family member has a high risk for the development of type 1 diabetes.</p><p>In a research setting, the following approach may be used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes progression for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) and insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2) autoantibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If they are present and confirmed in a subsequent sample, tests for insulin, zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), and islet cell antibodies (ICA) can be done and the first phase insulin response to glucose (FPIR) determined.</p><p/><p>The occurrence of multiple antibodies against islet autoantigens serves as a surrogate marker of disease in primary or secondary intervention strategies aimed at halting the disease process.</p><p>Genetic typing for susceptibility or protective human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles can also be performed. In the aggregate, this information can be used to ascertain if a high-risk subject is eligible to be entered into an ongoing prevention trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134693686\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge David McCulloch, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bluestone JA, Herold K, Eisenbarth G.
