As such, these are often combined together and define epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in clinical trials and clinical practice. This topic will consider all three histologies under the heading EOC. </p><p>EOC is the most common cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of women have stage III (disease that has spread throughout the peritoneal cavity or that involves lymph nodes) or stage IV (disease spread to more distant sites) disease at diagnosis.

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to definitive surgery is an alternative option in selected patients. This topic will review the rationale and administration of NACT for EOC.

The goal of NACT is to reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality and increase the likelihood of a complete resection of disease at the time of cytoreductive surgery. Despite the potentially improved surgical outcomes that result from NACT, clinical studies have shown that survival is not improved with NACT compared with standard surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>NACT permits the assessment of the effectiveness of chemotherapy prior to surgery, which may help to inform subsequent treatment. Patients who respond well to neoadjuvant therapy are ideal candidates for cytoreductive surgery, while patients who respond poorly or progress on NACT are not likely to benefit from surgical cytoreduction because their disease has proven to be chemotherapy resistant, placing them at high risk for recurrence despite surgery. (See <a href=\"#H107813345\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of patients who progress on NACT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282420859\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus on which patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) should be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) (versus primary debulking surgery). We prefer NACT for patients with EOC who are poor operative candidates because of medical comorbidities or a poor performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 1</a>). In addition, we offer NACT to women with advanced EOC (eg, stage IIIC or IV) with clinically apparent unresectable disease who are unlikely to become complete or optimally cytoreduced (ie, no residual cancer or &lt;10 mm of residual disease at the end of surgery, respectively) if taken to the operating room at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H282421114\" class=\"local\">'Defining unresectable disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The lack of consensus on who are candidates for NACT was reflected at the fourth Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) consensus conference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While the majority of attendees felt that NACT was a standard option for all patients with advanced EOC, others felt that NACT should be offered to a more clearly defined subgroup of women in whom upfront surgery is contraindicated (eg, due to medical comorbidities or poor performance status) or those with imaging detected evidence of tumor dissemination that suggests complete cytoreduction is not possible. In addition, while 82 percent of Society of Gynecologic Oncologist members did not feel there was evidence to justify the administration of NACT in EOC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], 70 percent of European Society of Gynecological Oncology (ESGO) members felt the evidence was sufficient to recommend NACT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Attempts to identify the subset of patients most likely to benefit from NACT are under active investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. For example, an exploratory analysis that included patients treated on the European Organization and Research for the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial sought to determine if baseline characteristics could identify patients most appropriate to undergo NACT rather than primary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The main findings were that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biomarkers were not predictive of five-year survival rates by modality of treatment. These included age, WHO performance status, tumor grade, tumor histology, serum CA-125, the presence of a pelvic mass, or the presence of an omental cake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the largest mass was prognostic for survival following primary surgery. Patients whose largest tumor size was &lt;40 mm had a higher five-year OS rate compared with those with larger tumor sizes (40 versus 14 percent, respectively). However, there was no clear association between survival and tumor largest dimension among patients treated with NACT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stage at presentation was also prognostic for survival. Women with stage IV disease had higher five-year OS rates following NACT compared with primary surgery (22 versus 5 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>These data suggest that preclinical features could help define those patients most likely to benefit from NACT. However, these data require prospective evaluation and should not be used to make decisions in routine clinical practice. The main results of the EORTC trial are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2084700402\" class=\"local\">'EORTC 55971 trial'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282421087\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision on whether to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is based on the clinical status of the patient and whether or not disease is resectable at the time of presentation. Therefore, all patients require clinical staging. At our institution, this requires baseline imaging (eg, computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) to determine if the disease is resectable or not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282421114\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining unresectable disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts agree that criteria for unresectability include patients with the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deep infiltration of the small bowel mesentery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse carcinomatosis involving the stomach <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large parts of the small or large bowel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltration of the duodenum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parts of the pancreas (not limited to the pancreatic tail) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of the large vessels of the hepatoduodenal ligament, celiac trunk or behind the porta hepatis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of the liver parenchyma</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282421153\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of diagnostic laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is often difficult to preoperatively assess whether women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) can be optimally cytoreduced at the time of primary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Therefore, we advocate a staged surgical assessment for these patients and perform a diagnostic laparoscopy to further evaluate for resectability. If the surgeon conducting the assessment feels disease is resectable, primary surgery should be performed. If complete resectability is unlikely, NACT can be administered. However, other experts prefer to proceed with NACT only in patients who appear to have unresectable disease based on imaging alone. </p><p>The importance of resectability is underscored by the prognostic significance of a complete or optimal cytoreduction for patients with advanced EOC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. However, complete cytoreduction do not solely depend upon the patient's and tumor's characteristics, but also depend on surgical expertise and an institution's infrastructure. In multidisciplinary cancer centers with advanced expertise in gynecologic oncology, optimal debulking rates in excess of 70 percent have been reported even for patients with bulky stage IIIC disease (ie, patients with evidence of abdominal metastases &ge;20 mm preoperatively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. We strongly advocate that a gynecologic oncologist be involved in surgical decision making and treatment in these circumstances. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12942670\"><span class=\"h1\">NACT VERSUS PRIMARY SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For selected patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) improves perioperative outcomes and the likelihood of an optimal cytoreduction at surgery compared with primary surgery. The impact of NACT compared with primary surgical cytoreduction was shown in a study involving 6844 women identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER) database linked to Medicare claims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Compared with primary surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significantly fewer ostomies placed (8 versus 19 percent), less small bowel resections (4 versus 6 percent), and less large bowel resections (11 versus 21 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant reduction in postoperative complications, including infection (18 versus 11 percent), gastrointestinal complications (35 versus 29 percent), and pulmonary problems (11 versus 4 percent)</p><p/><p>Despite the benefits of NACT on perioperative outcomes and on the likelihood of a complete cytoreduction, NACT does not appear to improve survival outcomes. The following studies illustrate this finding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2084700402\"><span class=\"h2\">EORTC 55971 trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial enrolled 670 women with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">IIIC/IV</span> epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who were randomly assigned to either primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy or to NACT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>&nbsp;for three cycles followed by interval surgical cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Compared with PDS, NACT resulted in the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower rate of complications as compared with initial surgery, including fewer postoperative deaths (0.7 versus 2.5 percent, respectively), infections (2 versus 8 percent), grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4</span> hemorrhage (4 versus 7 percent), and thrombotic events (0 versus 2.6 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher rate of optimal cytoreduction (defined as &lt;10 mm of residual disease at the end of surgery) (81 versus 42 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No difference in median progression free survival (PFS, 12 months in each arm; hazard ratio [HR] 1.01, 95% CI 0.86-1.17) or overall survival (OS, 29 versus 30 months, HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82-1.18). However, patients treated with primary surgery experienced a statistically nonsignificant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with those who underwent NACT if there was no residual disease at the time of surgery (45 versus 38 months, respectively) or if there was microscopic residual disease only (ie, to less than 10 mm residual disease, 32 versus 27 months).</p><p/><p>This trial highlighted potential risks associated with NACT, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease progression &ndash; Approximately 10 percent of those patients who started NACT did not undergo interval surgical cytoreduction, likely due to early disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic imprecision &ndash; For patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer is based on core biopsy or cytologic evaluation of specimens obtained commonly from a peritoneal implant or from pleural or ascitic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As a result, some patients may be wrongly diagnosed as having EOC and subsequently subjected to incorrect chemotherapy and unnecessary surgery. Approximately three percent of patients (n = 18) treated on this study had their diagnosis changed at the time of surgery. </p><p/><p>This study has also been criticized for use of a wide variety of chemotherapy regimens (only 78 and 88 percent of patients in the primary surgery and interval debulking cohorts received platinum and taxane-based chemotherapy, respectively), potential patient selection bias whereby only the <span class=\"nowrap\">sickest/most</span> medically infirm or the most advanced stage <span class=\"nowrap\">IIIC/IV</span> disease patients were enrolled, and the heterogeneity in surgical outcomes observed (eg, low rates of complete surgical cytoreduction) in different countries. In addition, the rate of optimal cytoreduction in the cohort undergoing primary surgery was only 42 percent (with less than half successfully cytoreduced to no residual disease), suggesting that maximal surgical effort was not uniformly attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2084700487\"><span class=\"h2\">Other trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the EORTC study discussed above, smaller studies have reported on the outcomes of primary surgery versus NACT. These are reviewed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CHemotherapy OR Upfront Surgery (CHORUS) trial was a non-inferiority trial that included 550 women with stage III to IV EOC (16 percent with stage IV disease) randomly assigned to primary surgery or NACT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among patients randomly assigned to primary surgery, optimal cytoreduction to no residual disease was achieved in only 18 percent of patients.<br/><br/>Compared with primary surgery, NACT resulted in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Similar OS outcomes compared to primary surgery, including three-year OS rate (34 versus 32 percent, respectively) and median OS (24 versus 22.6 months).<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Similar PFS (median, 12 versus 10 months, respectively; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76-1.09).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The HR for death was 0.87 in favor of NACT (95% CI, 0.72-1.05). The upper limit of the confidence interval was within the predefined non-inferiority boundary set at 1.18, which shows that NACT was deemed non-inferior to primary surgery. However, because the impact of surgical cytoreduction has been closely linked with survival outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the low rate of optimal cytoreduction in the primary surgery arm of this study likely attenuated any potential survival benefit of this approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a phase III study from India, 139 patients with stage IIIC or IV EOC were randomly assigned primary surgery or NACT (with interval surgical cytoreduction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Compared with primary surgery, NACT resulted in a higher rate of optimal cytoreduction (85 versus 23 percent). Furthermore, NACT resulted in shorter inpatient admission days (8 versus 12 days), infection rates (1.4 versus 13 percent), and lower operative mortality (1 versus 6 percent), compared with primary surgical resection. However, there was no difference in progression free or overall survival between the two arms.</p><p/><p>The Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) 0602 trial compares primary surgical cytoreduction followed by eight cycles of chemotherapy with four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery plus additional four cycles of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

For example, we may offer <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/IP</span> treatment to patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to a high initial preoperative risk and subsequently underwent optimal cytoreduction. However, we would rarely utilize <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/IP</span> therapy for patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment due to extensive extra-abdominal disease.</p><p>Potential benefits were also found in preliminary results from the phase II <span class=\"nowrap\">OV21/PETROC</span> study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In this study, approximately 200 women who had been treated with NACT and underwent an optimal cytoreduction were randomly assigned to a 21-day cycle regimen consisting of IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> (administered on days 1 and 8) or to one of two IP-containing regimens, which utilized either IP carboplatin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>. Following an interim evaluation, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended that the study proceed as a two-arm trial comparing IV versus IP carboplatin, and the arm utilizing IP cisplatin was subsequently dropped. The rate of disease progression at nine months was improved among those receiving IV <span class=\"nowrap\">paclitaxel/IP</span> carboplatin compared with those receiving IV treatment only (25 percent [95% CI 16.5 to 34 percent] versus 39 percent [95% CI 29 to 49 percent]). Although not powered to detect differences in median survival, IV <span class=\"nowrap\">paclitaxel/IP</span> carboplatin was associated with trends in improved median progression-free survival (PFS, 12.5 versus 11.3 months) and overall survival (OS, 59.3 versus 38.1 months). Unfortunately, the trial, which was originally intended to go to phase III testing, was terminated due to lack of funding. </p><p>Despite these results, it remains unclear whether <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/IP</span> therapy should be standard treatment for patients who have received neoadjuvant treatment and optimal cytoreduction, particularly given mixed results from previous studies regarding its tolerability in this subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. Furthermore, <span class=\"nowrap\">OV21/PETROC</span> was a phase II study, and there is no planned phase III study underway, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding relative efficacy. Finally, rather than a dose-dense or every-three-week schedule of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, patients assigned to IV treatment on day 1 received paclitaxel 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> plus IV carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) <span class=\"nowrap\">5/6</span> and on day 8 received paclitaxel 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> possibly decreasing the efficacy of the control arm. </p><p>Overall, available data suggest that IP chemotherapy after NACT is feasible, although they are not definitive. Still, on the basis of these results, <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/IP</span> treatment appears to be a reasonable alternative in select women who undergo optimal cytoreduction following NACT. Further discussion on the role of IP therapy for EOC among patients who did not receive neoadjuvant treatment is discussed separately.

In the intention-to-treat analysis, at a median follow-up of 4.7 years, fewer patients had died in the HIPEC group (50 versus 62 percent). The HIPEC group had a longer median recurrence-free survival (14.2 versus 10.7 months) and median overall survival (45.7 versus 33.9 months). The rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar in the two groups (27 and 25 percent). </p><p>This differs from the IP regimens evaluated above, since the study participants received six cycles of IV therapy, and in addition received HIPEC concomitantly with interval debulking surgery. Results of the trial appear promising, but this approach requires further evaluation. A limitation of the trial was that the intervention arm was actually three interventions; it is not clear if the additional dose of chemotherapy, the IP administration, or the heating was responsible for the benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-newly-diagnosed-advanced-ovarian-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

It is highly unlikely that these patients (who were not candidates for a complete cytoreduction at presentation) will be candidates for an optimal cytoreduction if there has been evidence of progression on NACT. In addition, disease progression on NACT is a sign of chemoresistant disease, which places these women at high risk for recurrence regardless of surgical cytoreduction. Therefore, these patients should be spared a potentially morbid operation of unclear survival benefit. Instead, we prefer to treat these patients with medical therapy similar to the treatment of women with platinum-resistant EOC.
