It is the most common of the indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial treatment of FL depends upon the stage of disease at presentation. Patients with early stage disease may be cured with radiation therapy, while patients with advanced stage disease are initially managed with an immunotherapy-based regimen (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> plus chemotherapy). The use of either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in FL is controversial and the subject of ongoing clinical trials. When applied to a highly selected patient population, autologous HCT results in a disease-free survival at 10 years of approximately 40 percent and has a low treatment-related mortality rate. In comparison, allogeneic HCT may cure a higher percentage of patients with advanced stage FL, but is associated with substantial treatment-related mortality.</p><p>The use of allogeneic HCT, however, is limited since even ideal candidates who undergo allogeneic HCT have a high rate of treatment-related mortality, its efficacy compared with autologous HCT is not fully established, and non-transplant treatment options have expanded over recent decades. In addition, chimeric antigen receptor modified T-cell therapy is being studied in patients with FL and may replace allogeneic HCT for a subset of patients. </p><p>The use of allogeneic HCT in FL is reviewed below. The use of autologous HCT in FL and comparison with other treatment options are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of limited stage (I/II) follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-cutaneous-follicle-center-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95432426\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF TRANSPLANT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal timing of HCT in FL is unknown and controversial. Ideally, allogeneic HCT should be performed within the context of a clinical trial. However, attempts to conduct randomized trials in this setting have failed. Outside of a clinical trial, HCT is reserved for patients with relapsed or refractory FL or for those with histologic transformation to a more aggressive histology. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma#H31594723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H221671\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING TRANSPLANT ELIGIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The determination of transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. Eligibility for HCT varies across countries and institutions and depends upon the type of transplantation (ie, allogeneic versus autologous) and the conditioning regimen (eg, myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative).</p><p>In most centers in the United States, patients are considered eligible for nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT if they are less than 70 years of age, with normal cardiac, liver, and renal function, and have a good performance status (ECOG performance status 0 or 1). For myeloablative allogeneic transplantation, eligibility is more restrictive in that patients should typically be less than 55 years of age.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of transplant eligibility is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H222242\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred donor for patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for FL is an HLA-matched sibling or matched unrelated donor (MUD). However, fewer than 25 percent of patients in the transplantable age group have an HLA-matched sibling donor. Allogeneic HCT using a partially matched family member donor or umbilical cord blood may be considered for patients who do not have an HLA-identical matched donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95432958\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATIVE REGIMEN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H222791\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparative regimens are generally divided into three categories: myeloablative, nonmyeloablative, and reduced-intensity regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Preparative regimen intensity defined'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myeloablative regimens &ndash; A myeloablative regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, and results in profound pancytopenia within one to three weeks from the time of administration. The resulting pancytopenia is long-lasting, usually irreversible, and in most instances fatal unless hematopoiesis is restored by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonmyeloablative regimens &ndash; A nonmyeloablative regimen is one that will cause minimal cytopenia (but significant lymphopenia) by itself and does not require stem cell support. However, the transplant, when given in this setting, usually becomes myeloablative because the engrafting donor T cells will eventually eliminate host hematopoietic cells, allowing the establishment of donor hematopoiesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced intensity regimens &ndash; Reduced intensity regimens are an intermediate category of regimens that do not fit the definition of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative. Such regimens cause cytopenias, which may be prolonged and result in significant morbidity and mortality, and require hematopoietic stem cell support.</p><p/><p>There is no clear consensus among experts regarding the ideal type of HCT for patients with FL. All three options appear to have a survival benefit for the treatment of relapsed FL, but differing risks. A comparison of nonrandomized trials of these different procedures is limited by the use of different patient selection criteria for the different regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Unfortunately, a randomized trial is difficult to perform in this circumstance.</p><p>Myeloablative allogeneic HCT is associated with a treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of approximately 15 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Given this high mortality rate, myeloablative allogeneic HCT is reserved for young, highly motivated patients with relapsed or resistant FL. In contrast, nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimens are associated with lower TRM (15 to 25 percent). Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens may be preferred for patients who have attained a second complete remission, but are not ideal candidates for conventional myeloablative HCT. In addition, patients who relapse after autologous HCT may be considered for nonmyeloablative (reduced intensity) allogeneic HCT.</p><p>Allogeneic HCT is associated with mortality from short-term (eg, graft-versus-host disease, infection) and long-term (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, other secondary malignancies) transplant-related complications. The toxicity of this procedure is considerably greater than that of autologous HCT or conventional therapy. Even with nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT, the TRM at two to three years ranges from 15 to 25 percent and largely reflects deaths from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of GVHD (especially chronic GVHD) is consistently above 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Despite this toxicity, single-institution series and registry studies have reported progression-free survival rates at three to five years of 45 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>].</p><p>The ideal preparative regimen for allogeneic HCT is unknown. The single-center and multicenter studies have reported similar survival rates for myeloablative and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; moreover, a study from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) showed no significant difference in progression-free or overall survival between the two modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In general, nonmyeloablative regimens are associated with lower TRM, but this benefit is offset by a higher risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/7,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13-15</a>]. The choice between myeloablative and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT may be made based on an assessment of the patient's comorbidities, the behavior of the disease, the quality of the remission, and the age of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H221671\" class=\"local\">'Determining transplant eligibility'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95433400\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonmyeloablative HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonmyeloablative preparative regimens use less intensive chemotherapy or irradiation alone prior to the infusion of donor hematopoietic stem cells. This approach relies more on donor cellular immune effects and less on the cytotoxic effects of the preparative regimen to control the underlying disease. Reduced intensity regimens are an intermediate category of regimens that do not fit the definition of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative. Nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT and reduced intensity HCT are associated with lower rates of treatment-related toxicity and treatment-related mortality, but higher rates of relapse compared with rates previously seen with myeloablative allogeneic transplantation.</p><p>Nonmyeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning regimens have extended the eligibility of allogeneic HCT to older patients and those with comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-23</a>]. Even for patients who have relapsed after autologous HCT, nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT affords the possibility of prolonged disease-free survival. The reported rates of progression-free survival after nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT vary, but are reliably above 40 percent (and mostly around 60 percent) at two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/8,17,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,22-25</a>]. In these series, there is also convincing evidence for a plateau in the progression-free survival curves suggesting that nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT has curative potential. Specific regimens used for nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H89394696\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Nonmyeloablative and reduced intensity preparative regimens'</a>.)</p><p>The following is a survey of studies that have reported on the use of nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT in patients with FL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The longest experience is from a prospective trial of nonmyeloablative HCT in 47 patients with chemotherapy sensitive relapsed FL given a preparative regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily for three days), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily for three days), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> for one day plus 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> a day for three days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The two patients with a matched unrelated donor were also given equine antithymocyte globulin prior to the graft infusion. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Acute GVHD was seen in 11 percent of patients. At a median follow-up of 107 months, the estimated rates of overall and progression-free survival at 11 years were 78 and 72 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another prospective trial, the same investigators treated 26 patients with relapsed or refractory (10 patients) FL with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan followed by allogeneic HCT from a 5 or 6 of 6 HLA-matched donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the estimated rates of progression-free and overall survival at three years were 85 and 88 percent, respectively. Similar outcomes were seen in patients with chemotherapy sensitive and chemotherapy refractory disease at the time of enrollment. The three-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 39 percent (24 percent extensive).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT involved 188 patients, including 52 previously-treated patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 85 percent of whom had chemosensitive disease; 29 percent had received a prior autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT yielded a 100-day treatment-related mortality of 11 percent and an estimated two-year overall survival rate of 65 percent.

Patients with indolent disease and related donors had even higher overall and progression-free survival rates of 67 and 54 percent, respectively. Treatment was well tolerated. Long-term complications were limited. Survivors had a median Karnofsky performance status rating of 85 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 1</a>).

When compared with autologous HCT, myeloablative allogeneic HCT results in lower relapse rates but a higher treatment-related mortality of approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/11,12,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,27,28</a>]. These differences were highlighted in a report from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 176 patients with FL, 67 percent of whom had chemotherapy-sensitive disease at the time of HCT, Kaplan-Meier estimates of treatment-related mortality, recurrence rates, and overall survival at five years following allogeneic HCT were 30, 21, and 51 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During this same period of time, 597 patients with FL received unpurged autologous HCT; 82 percent were chemotherapy sensitive at the time of transplant.

At five years, disease-free survival was 62 percent, with a relapse rate of 13 percent.

Engraftment takes longer than it does for autologous HCT, and infections are more common. Virtually all patients require blood product support in the form of red blood cell and platelet transfusions until the transplanted marrow cells engraft sufficiently to support hematopoiesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic support after hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who undergo HCT are at risk for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, the time course of which varies in the post-transplant period, according to the degree of immune deficiency and cytopenia induced by the transplantation procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64491 \">figure 1</a>). Prophylactic therapies to prevent infection, including antiviral and antifungal drugs, are recommended during a period of increased risk.

(See <a href=\"#H95432426\" class=\"local\">'Timing of transplant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To be eligible for HCT, the patient must have normal cardiac, liver, and renal function, and have a good performance status. In most centers in the United States, patients are considered eligible for nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT if they are less than 70 years of age. For myeloablative allogeneic transplantation, patients should typically be less than 55 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma#H220253\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Determining transplant eligibility'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision of whether to proceed with transplantation should be based on the patient's preference, condition, and the expected disease course. For the latter, there is no definitive score or metric. For eligible patients who relapse after a short initial response (ie, &lt;1 to 2 years) to chemoimmunotherapy and demonstrate chemotherapy sensitive disease, we suggest autologous HCT rather than treatment with chemoimmunotherapy alone or allogeneic HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We consider nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT for eligible patients who relapse after autologous HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma#H179016836\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Relapsed disease'</a> and <a href=\"#H222791\" class=\"local\">'Choice of regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of allogeneic HCT, however, is limited since even ideal candidates who undergo allogeneic HCT have a high rate of treatment-related mortality and non-transplant treatment options have expanded over recent decades. In addition, chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell therapy is being studied in patients with FL and may replace allogeneic HCT for a subset of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When compared with autologous HCT, allogeneic HCT is associated with a higher treatment related mortality rate (15 to 25 percent), but a higher potential rate of cure (50 to 60 percent). In some series, nonmyeloablative preparative regimens are associated with lower treatment related mortality, but this benefit is offset by a higher risk of relapse. (See <a href=\"#H95433425\" class=\"local\">'Myeloablative HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for relapsed FL after an allogeneic HCT include reduction of immunosuppression, donor lymphocyte infusion, and treatment with salvage chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H221821\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of relapse after HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Oliansky DM, Gordon LI, King J, et al.
