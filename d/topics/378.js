Unlike <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, which requires an intravenous infusion, adalimumab is administered by subcutaneous injection.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> in Crohn disease, while its role in other disorders is presented separately.

A fourth study (CLASSIC-II) provided follow-up of CLASSIC-I by assessing maintenance therapy in patients who were in remission following induction. EXTEND is an additional trial that examined adalimumab for induction and maintenance therapy. EXTEND differed from previous trials with adalimumab in that its primary objective was mucosal healing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CLASSIC-I trial included 299 patients with moderate to severely active Crohn disease despite concomitant therapies (including one or more of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>, glucocorticoid, immunosuppressive agents, and antibiotics) who had no previous exposure to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. They were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> at three different doses or placebo at zero and two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The primary endpoint was induction of clinical remission after four weeks. A linear dose-response curve was demonstrated, with the most effective dose being the highest studied: a loading dose of 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg at week 2. Remission (Crohn disease activity index [CDAI] &lt;150 points) at four weeks was achieved significantly more often in patients receiving the 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/80</span> mg dose compared with placebo (36 versus 12 percent). Similarly, a response (CDAI decrease of 100 points) at four weeks was achieved significantly more often in patients who received the 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/80</span> mg dose compared with placebo (50 versus 25 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CLASSIC-II trial included a total of 276 patients from CLASSIC-I who received open-label <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> (40 mg) at weeks 0 and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fifty-five patients who were in remission at both weeks 0 (week 4 of the CLASSIC-I trial) and 4 were re-randomized to three treatment groups: placebo or adalimumab 40 mg every other week or 40 mg weekly for 56 weeks. Patients who were not in remission at both weeks 0 and 4 received open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week. In those who did not respond or who had a flare, the dose could be increased to 40 mg weekly. The primary endpoint was clinical remission after 56 weeks.<br/><br/>Of the 55 patients randomized at week 4, remission at week 56 was seen in 79 percent of adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 83 percent of 40 mg weekly, and 44 percent of those treated with placebo. Response at week 56 was seen in 89 percent, 79 percent, and 56 percent, respectively. These data suggest that the maintenance of remission can be achieved in the majority of patients who achieved remission with induction therapy.<br/><br/>Of the 204 who entered the open-label arm, 46 percent were in clinical remission and 65 percent were considered responders at week 56. That the open-label arm had a lower percentage of patients in remission compared with the randomized arm implies that patients in full remission after their induction of adalimumab have a greater chance of staying in remission after one year. Approximately one-half of the patients in the open-label arm had increased the dose of adalimumab from every other week to weekly by week 56.<br/><br/>Patients generally respond within the first week. However, in some patients, the response to adalimumab was not fully achieved until week 12 after induction. This observation suggests a time frame that may be required for assessing the clinical response and need for maintenance therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CHARM trial (Crohn's Trial of the Fully Human Antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Adalimumab</a> for Remission Maintenance) examined the efficacy of adalimumab for long-term maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It included a total of 854 patients with active disease despite concomitant therapies that included one or more of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>, glucocorticoid, immunosuppressive agents, and antibiotics. Previous responders to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> were also included. All patients received open-label adalimumab (80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2). It is noteworthy that this dose is lower than that in CLASSIC and that approved for clinical use. At week 4, patients were randomly assigned to adalimumab (40 mg every other week or 40 mg weekly) or placebo for a total of 56 weeks.<br/><br/>Of the 854 enrolled, 76 withdrew before randomization. At week four, 499 of the remaining 778 patients (64 percent) had achieved a clinical response, a response rate similar to that seen in CLASSIC-I. At week 56, remission rates in the 40 mg every other week and 40 mg weekly groups were significantly higher than with placebo (36 and 41 versus 12 percent, respectively). A clinical response was seen in 52 percent, 53 percent, and 26 percent, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the two adalimumab doses. In two follow-up reports, patients in the adalimumab group had significantly lower risk of hospitalization and surgery at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and had sustained improvements in health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].<br/><br/>Subgroup analysis of the CHARM data demonstrates that among the 260 patients randomized to adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance dosing, 71 patients (27 percent) required dose escalation to 40 mg every week dosing. Among those who required dose escalation, 54 (76 percent) subsequently achieved a response.<br/><br/>A follow-up report described outcomes in patients who received continuous adalimumab versus those who received induction followed by reinitiation when clinical deterioration occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. At week 56, significantly more patients who received continuous therapy were in clinical remission (50 versus 38 percent). Furthermore, patients receiving continuous adalimumab had significantly lower rates of Crohn disease-related and all-cause hospitalization.<br/><br/>An open-label extension of CHARM was conducted in which patients from all groups were given adalimumab 40 mg every other week up to two years of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients who had already been moved to open-label weekly adalimumab continued their regimen. At the conclusion of this time period, patients were analyzed depending on their original treatment randomization. Clinical remission rates were 37.6, 41.9, and 49.8 percent in patients who had originally been randomized to placebo, adalimumab every other week, and adalimumab weekly, respectively. A follow-up analysis demonstrated that of patients on adalimumab with remission at year 1, 54 percent remained in remission at year 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The EXTEND trial looked at <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> for induction and maintenance of mucosal healing in 135 adults with moderate to severe Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. All patients received induction with adalimumab (160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2). At week 4, patients were randomly assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week through week 52. Starting at week 8, patients who did not respond to treatment or who developed flares were allowed to receive open-label adalimumab after first undergoing ileocolonoscopy. For continued <span class=\"nowrap\">flares/nonresponse,</span> the dosing interval was decreased to 40 mg weekly.<br/><br/>The primary endpoint was mucosal healing at week 12 (for patients who switched to adalimumab between weeks 8 and 12, ileocolonoscopy results prior to switching, were used). There was a trend toward more patients in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieving the primary endpoint (27 versus 13 percent, p = 0.056). A statistically significant difference in mucosal healing rates was seen between the groups at week 52 (24 and 0 percent, respectively; patients who switched to open-label adalimumab were considered treatment failures for the secondary endpoints).

At one year, 29 percent of patients had discontinued adalimumab (12 percent had a primary nonresponse, 3 percent had a loss of response, and 14 percent had an adverse event).

Patients who do not respond within this interval should not continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>.</p><p>Patients who lose their response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> should have their dosing interval shortened to every week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A meta-analysis of 39 studies showed that the mean percentage of loss of response to adalimumab among primary responders was 18 percent and the annual risk was 20 percent per patient-year; the mean percentage of patients who required dose intensification among primary responders to adalimumab was 37 percent and the annual risk was 25 percent per patient-year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A large number of factors predict loss of response or dose escalation in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> (male gender, high body mass index, <span class=\"nowrap\">current/former</span> smoking, family history of inflammatory bowel disease, isolated colonic disease, extraintestinal manifestations, <span class=\"nowrap\">80/40</span> mg induction therapy, longer disease duration, greater baseline Crohn Disease Activity Index, concomitant glucocorticoid use, absence of deep remission at week 12, low serum trough concentrations of adalimumab, previous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> non-response, and prior treatment with an anti-TNF-alpha agent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, there are no data to support the use of a higher initial dose of adalimumab in any patient subgroup, as pooled analysis demonstrated that dose escalation permitted response to be regained in 71 percent and remission in 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Where available, use of therapeutic drug monitoring of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> and anti-adalimumab antibody measurement may be helpful to guide therapy. Adalimumab drug levels correlate inversely with disease activity, but their use in clinical decision-making has not been assessed in prospective randomized fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In patients with secondary loss of response to adalimumab, it is intuitive that patients with antibodies against adalimumab would benefit from a change in biologic agent, whereas those with low drug levels but no antibodies against adalimumab could derive benefit from dose escalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adalimumab-for-treatment-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients with ample adalimumab in the face of loss of response would be expected to need a biologic agent with an alternative mechanism of action to anti-TNF agents.

Concomitant therapy in the first six months of treatment was associated with a lower rate of treatment failure (5 versus 10 percent).
