However, the physiologic definition of asthma is relatively nonspecific, consisting of airway hyperreactivity and airflow limitation during expiration, which is variable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reversible with bronchodilators. In most asthma patients, the presence of bronchial hyperreactivity is never objectively confirmed.</p><p>The data suggesting that multiple phenotypes exist within the classification of &quot;severe asthma&quot; are reviewed here. Details regarding the classification, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of severe asthma are provided separately.

After confirming a diagnosis of asthma and addressing comorbidities, severe asthma is that which requires treatment with high dose inhaled glucocorticoids plus a second controller <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic glucocorticoids to prevent asthma from becoming 'uncontrolled' or which remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460452191\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR CHARACTERIZING ASTHMA PHENOTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe asthma present with a variety of clinical histories, physiologic changes (beyond changes in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>]), and airway inflammation, suggesting that severe asthma is not a single disease or is a single process that produces widely varying host responses. Patients with severe asthma may have manifested severe disease all their life, developed progressively more severe disease over time, or may never have had asthma (to the best of their recollection) until some point in their adult life, after which the disease progressed at a rapid pace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some patients with severe asthma have a clearly defined atopic history, while others give little indication of an allergic component. </p><p>In addition to the variability in clinical features, patients with asthma do not respond in a uniform fashion to asthma medications, particularly glucocorticoids and other nonspecific <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-inflammatory/cytotoxic</span> medications. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that molecular pathways can have different, clinically recognizable phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. It is hoped that exploration of asthma phenotypes will translate into improved understanding of asthma pathophysiology and optimized medication selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SEVERE ASTHMA PHENOTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who meet the definition of severe asthma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68983 \">table 1</a>), a variety of clinical presentations, physiological characteristics, and responses to therapy are evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/1,2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7,8</a>]. Disease characteristics (phenotypes) that are most commonly used to differentiate patients with severe asthma are described in this section. However, substantial overlap exists; as an example, adult onset asthma does not exclude atopy, although it makes it less likely.</p><p>In order to characterize the various presentations of severe asthma, two statistical cluster analyses were performed on patients participating in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP), including those with mild, moderate, and severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The first cluster analysis only utilized clinical and physiologic data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], while the second analysis also included bronchoscopic and inflammatory variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While similar, some differences were noted. Both cluster analyses identified childhood onset, generally allergic asthma from mild to severe, and very severe asthma with a mixed inflammatory process. The inflammatory clusters also identified a very distinct group with adult onset disease and nasal polyposis. (See <a href=\"#H111786446\" class=\"local\">'Hypereosinophilic adult onset asthma and aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The following sections describe characteristics that have been identified (with greater or lesser frequency) among patients with severe asthma and potential ramifications in terms of treatment choices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111786440\"><span class=\"h2\">Childhood onset allergic asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from case series of patients with severe asthma suggest that childhood-onset (before the age of 12) versus later onset (after age 12) distinguishes two distinct subgroups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/2,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10-12</a>]. Childhood-onset asthma represents a relatively homogeneous group of patients, often with a strong allergic history and family history of asthma. In contrast, adult-onset asthmatics are a very mixed group of patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2586255058\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult onset atopic asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with adult onset asthma, those with severe disease are less likely to be atopic (34 percent) than those with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma (52 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. While only applicable to a minority of severe asthma patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">atopic/allergic</span> asthma can arise in adulthood, often in patients with a history of allergic rhinitis in childhood. Identifying the presence of atopy has implications for selection of therapy and potentially for environmental modifications (eg, dust mite mitigation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger control to enhance asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As an example, treatment with the monoclonal antibody to IgE (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>) is indicated for patients with severe asthma, elevated IgE levels (eg, 35 to 700 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL),</span> and positive allergy skin tests to perennial allergens. Treatment with omalizumab can reduce the frequency of exacerbations and reduces the inhaled glucocorticoid requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As only about 30 percent of allergic asthmatics appear to respond to omalizumab, it remains to be determined whether there is a specific subphenotype of allergic asthma that responds better than others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-ige-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anti-IgE therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553892079\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult onset nonatopic asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with adult onset asthma describe the onset of asthma symptoms following a viral illness, occupational exposure, or the ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, while such histories are less frequent among those with childhood-onset asthma. In adult-onset asthma, an allergic component may be more difficult to confirm, as significantly fewer asthmatics with onset of disease after the age of 12 demonstrate positive allergy skin tests or specific allergic symptoms compared to early onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111786446\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypereosinophilic adult onset asthma and aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subset of patients with adult onset eosinophilic asthma require systemic glucocorticoids to maintain control of their asthma and often early in the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/9-11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11,13</a>]. They are less likely to be <span class=\"nowrap\">atopic/allergic</span> but have high levels of blood and tissue eosinophils, as well as high levels of exhaled nitric oxide. These findings are often seen in association with severe sinus disease, nasal polyposis, and in a minority, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).</p><p>AERD refers to the combination of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyposis, and acute upper and lower respiratory tract reactions to ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) and other cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibiting nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>AERD is good example of the complex overlap between the various phenotypes of severe asthma, as illustrated by the following observations. Peripheral blood eosinophilia occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients with AERD, although not all patients with eosinophilic asthma have AERD. Depending on the case series, between 30 and 70 percent of patients with AERD are atopic.</p><p>Patients with AERD have a baseline dysregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism with over-production of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4, which are potent bronchoconstrictors and promoters of airway inflammation. In the presence of COX-1 inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (ASA) and NSAIDs, COX-1 inhibition leads to a further increase in production of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4. Leukotriene modifying agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zafirlukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zafirlukast</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zileuton-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zileuton</a>) are used to address the underlying dysregulation of leukotriene production and also protect patients from severe exacerbations due to accidental NSAID exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;, section on 'Abnormalities in AERD'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> desensitization can be helpful in patients with AERD (with primary benefits in the upper airway), although it is not used in all patients, often for safety concerns.

In a preliminary study, a monoclonal antibody (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupilumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dupilumab</a>) to the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL-R4A), which inhibits the activity of the Type 2 cytokines IL-4 and -13, reduced polyp scores in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis (50 percent had asthma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Smaller studies of anti-IL-5 and anti-IgE in this population also showed modest efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-agents-for-asthma#H12303539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational agents for asthma&quot;, section on 'Biologic agents'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-ige-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anti-IgE therapy&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Not all patients with adult onset hypereosinophilic asthma have nasal polyps or AERD. However, they are often refractory to inhaled therapy alone. Early studies with anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies suggest that patients with hypereosinophilic adult onset asthma may respond favorably to anti-IL-5 directed therapy, including an improved ability to taper oral glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-agents-for-asthma#H12304132\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational agents for asthma&quot;, section on 'Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111786777\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthmatic granulomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with severe asthma have granulomatous inflammation on lung biopsy. It is not known whether this inflammation is an intercurrent disease process, a consequence of therapy, or different asthma phenotype. In a case series that included 19 patients with severe asthma who underwent video-assisted lung biopsy, 10 were found to have interstitial non-necrotizing granulomas with asthma-like submucosal inflammation and mucus plugging in the small airways, and without evidence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Peripheral blood eosinophilia was present in most, and the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE<sub>NO</sub>) was elevated. Atopy was present in 6 of 10. Computed tomography was abnormal in some patients, and a large majority had a family history of autoimmune disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of severe asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Conditions that mimic asthma'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3692466186\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain clinical characteristics have been identified that are associated with severe asthma but do not define a particular phenotype. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82118399\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, most severe asthmatics receive oral or high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids. Thus, most severe asthma has an element of GC resistance. However, even with these very potent anti-inflammatory drugs, the response to therapy is often variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In some patients with severe asthma, the response appears to be shifted, so that although a response occurs, it requires extremely high doses. These patients would appear to be &quot;glucocorticoid-dependent.&quot; In others, even high doses of glucocorticoids may lead to little or no response, or even worsening. These patients may be truly glucocorticoid-resistant, but are likely in a minority. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms and clinical implications of glucocorticoid resistance in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many, if not most studies of glucocorticoid resistance have been done in moderate rather than severe asthmatics, and extrapolation from those results is often difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Some severe asthmatics may not demonstrate an improvement with glucocorticoids on a chronic basis, but may demonstrate improvement with glucocorticoids during a period of exacerbation. This difference in the acute versus chronic response has not been studied to date. In addition, patients with persistent sputum eosinophilia appear to respond better to high dose glucocorticoid therapy than those with no evidence for eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, GC resistance is a rather vague term. Generally this term has been replaced with more specific phenotypes below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3407859919\"><span class=\"h2\">Exacerbation frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with severe asthma have frequent episodes of extreme airflow limitation (brittle asthma), while others do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. No consistent definition of &quot;frequent exacerbation&quot; has been agreed upon, but more than two or three exacerbations during a year is commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of patients with severe asthma meet this definition of frequent exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Patients with frequent exacerbations tend to have greater peripheral airway obstruction on pulmonary function tests, persistent eosinophilia in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage, and more comorbidities (eg, chronic rhinosinusitis, recurrent respiratory infections, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and psychosocial issues) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/9,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,31,32</a>]. </p><p>Among patients enrolled in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP), frequent exacerbations were associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage despite high doses of systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, similar to GC resistant asthma, the characteristic of frequent exacerbations may be due to multiple different and unrelated factors, like smoking, obesity, and psychologic factors. Therefore, this clinical phenotype has generally been replaced with the phenotypes below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2973156713\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma associated with obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have identified an increased prevalence of asthma among obese individuals compared with those of normal weight, although the exact reason for the association is not known. In a Dutch cohort, the prevalence of obesity (body mass index &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> among a cohort with severe asthma was 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]; in a similar cohort in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of obesity was 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The risk of obesity-associated asthma is higher for women than men and among nonatopic individuals than atopic. Asthma associated with obesity is often more difficult to control and less likely to respond to traditional asthma therapy.</p><p>Despite the association of obesity and asthma, studies addressing the role of weight loss for severe asthma are limited and improved asthma control has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2817209343\"><span class=\"h2\">Perimenopausal onset asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Onset of asthma within a year of a woman's last menstrual period may define a separate asthma phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a case series, induced sputum from 40 women with menopause onset asthma showed a higher percentage of neutrophils and slightly lower percentage of eosinophils compared with sputum from 35 women with premenopausal onset asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. None of the women with menopausal onset asthma were atopic, while 76 percent of the premenopausal asthma onset group were atopic. Whether menopausal onset asthma is different from adult onset asthma in men requires additional study. Whether menopausal onset asthma is different from adult onset asthma in men requires additional study. How much overlap there is with the adult onset less atopic, generally obese women from the cluster analysis of the Severe Asthma Research Program population remains to be determined, but a large percentage of that population was also post-menopausal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111786756\"><span class=\"h1\">PHENOTYPING BASED ON BIOMARKERS OF INFLAMMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is hoped that identifying biomarkers for the various asthma phenotypes will aid the selection of therapies that are most likely to work for individual patients. Considerable progress has been made in this area, with most asthma experts now classifying asthma patients based on the amount of Type 2 (T2) inflammation. </p><p>T2 inflammation is mediated by eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, T helper-2 lymphocytes (secrete interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5 and IL-13), group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), and IgE-producing B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Some patients have evidence of high levels of T2 inflammation (T2-high) and others have little or no evidence for T2 inflammation. This division of asthma phenotypes based on biomarkers is increasingly important, at least in the case of T2 biomarkers, as specific T2-targeted therapies with considerable efficacy have been approved for use in T2-high patients (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepolizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reslizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">reslizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benralizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benralizumab</a>). </p><p>The exact promoters of severe asthma in patients with T2-low inflammation are less well-characterized than the T2-high phenotype, but likely involve neutrophilic, smooth muscle, or metabolic-related processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111786732\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2-like/Eosinophilic asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of severe asthma is associated with persistent elevation in markers of Type 2 inflammation, likely arising from residual elevations in the Type 2 cytokines IL-4, 5, and 13. Data in support for this concept arise from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) and other clinical networks, as well as clinical trials of antibodies directed towards these cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/21,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,38-41</a>]. </p><p>As noted above, in severe asthma, the eosinophilic phenotype appears more common among late onset asthma than childhood onset, which is more typically associated with atopy (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Severe asthma phenotypes'</a> above). However, data from clinical trials suggest that levels of eosinophils between 200 and <span class=\"nowrap\">300/microL</span> or fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE<sub>NO</sub>) levels above 20 ppb support an underlying active Type 2 immune process, which will respond to Type 2 specific therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/22,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,38</a>]. The ideal method for assessing Type 2 inflammation is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Sputum eosinophilia and measurement of T2 cytokine mRNA in sputum predict airway eosinophilia, but are time consuming tests and observer dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Statistical associations have been noted between sputum eosinophilia and peripheral blood eosinophil counts, FE<sub>NO</sub>, and serum periostin, but the accuracy of these biomarkers for predicting sputum eosinophilia is imperfect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. The European Respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">Society/American</span> Thoracic Society guidelines suggest that treatment of severe asthma be guided by clinical criteria and sputum eosinophil counts (performed in centers experienced in this technique) rather than by clinical criteria alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Peripheral blood eosinophils appear to be good predictors of response to Type-2 targeted therapy as shown in studies of the monoclonal antibodies to IL-5 (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepolizumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reslizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">reslizumab</a>) and also anti-IL-4RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/18,22,23,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22,23,46</a>].

Increased FE<sub>NO</sub> levels (eg, greater than 50 ppb in adults or greater than 35 ppb in children) correlate with eosinophilic airway inflammation and responsiveness to inhaled glucocorticoids. In a study of bronchial brushings and sputum obtained from subjects with severe asthma, <span class=\"nowrap\">mild/moderate</span> asthma (on or off inhaled glucocorticoids), and healthy controls, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), the enzyme which generates exhaled NO, differentiated severe asthma from the other groups better than FE<sub>NO</sub>, arginase2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mRNA/protein,</span> or nitrotyrosine (NT) protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a separate study from SARP, FE<sub>NO</sub> was a better predictor of systemic glucocorticoid use among patients with severe asthma than forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. FE<sub>NO</sub> is also consistently decreased in response to <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-4/-13</span> targeted therapies suggesting that at least a portion of the FE<sub>NO</sub> is driven by these cytokines. However, a number of other factors have been identified that affect FE<sub>NO</sub> values, such as age, sex, atopy, and cigarette smoking, making it an imperfect biomarker for guiding therapeutic decisions. Thus, the European Respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">Society/American</span> Thoracic Society guidelines suggest against using FE<sub>NO</sub> to guide treatment decisions in severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The specificity of neutrophilic inflammation for a particular subtype of asthma is complicated by the many confounding factors that can contribute to neutrophilia in sputum, including the use of inhaled glucocorticoids, air pollution, respiratory infection, sensitization to aspergillus, and gastroesophageal disease. In one study, sputum neutrophilia was associated with pre and post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, suggesting that neutrophilic airway inflammation may have a role in persistent airflow limitation in asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Analysis of patients in SARP identified two subgroups with moderate-to-severe asthma and frequent health care use despite treatment with high doses of inhaled or oral glucocorticoids; one of these subgroups also had reduced lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/2,9,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,53</a>]. The majority (&gt;83 percent) of those with reduced lung function (cluster 5, described above) had sputum neutrophilia alone or in combination with sputum eosinophilia. The combination of neutrophilia and eosinophilia in sputum appears to identify a more severe phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-asthma-phenotypes/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Ideally, biomarkers would be reproducible, accurate, and accessible noninvasively. International guidelines suggest that treatment of severe asthma be guided by clinical criteria and peripheral blood or sputum eosinophil counts (performed in centers experienced in this technique) rather than by clinical criteria alone. On the other hand, guidelines advise against using fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE<sub>NO</sub>) to guide treatment decisions in severe asthma due to uncertain benefits.
