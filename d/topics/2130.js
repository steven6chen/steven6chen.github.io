Although these office measurements are recommended to identify patients who might have hypertension, many such individuals will not have hypertension upon further testing (ie, they have white coat hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Our approach to measuring BP for the purposes of diagnosing and confirming hypertension depends in part upon the feasibility of performing ABPM, home BP monitoring, and, if neither ABPM nor home BP monitoring are feasible, whether or not an automated oscillometric BP (AOBP) device is used in the clinician's office [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform ABPM if it is feasible to establish a diagnosis of hypertension.

(See <a href=\"#H10945925\" class=\"local\">'Home blood pressure monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If home BP monitoring is not feasible (patient cannot afford a cuff or find a suitably sized cuff), then BP must be measured in the office. However, if office BP is used to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension, multiple measurements on different days are required (see <a href=\"#H10945945\" class=\"local\">'Office-based blood pressure measurement'</a> below):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the office has an AOBP device that can automatically take and average multiple measurements with the patient <strong>alone</strong> in a room, then we use this technique to measure BP.

(See <a href=\"#H3214368636\" class=\"local\">'Routine office-based blood pressure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patients being managed for previously diagnosed hypertension should monitor their BP at home, if possible. If home BP cannot be monitored, management of the patient can be informed by office measurements (performed using an AOBP device if available).</p><p>Practical aspects of ABPM, home BP measurement, AOBP, and routine office BP are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H10945858\" class=\"local\">'Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10945925\" class=\"local\">'Home blood pressure monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10945945\" class=\"local\">'Office-based blood pressure measurement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3163955934\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of blood pressure measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, measurements obtained by ABPM and home BP monitoring are lower than those obtained by routine office measurement by approximately 5 to 10 mmHg. In addition, office readings obtained using an AOBP device (in which multiple BP measurements are automatically obtained and averaged with the patient alone in a room [ie, unattended measurement]) more closely approximate ABPM and home BP readings than standard office measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The use of AOBP as an office-based strategy to approximate ambulatory or casual home BP has been extensively examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The following studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study, 2145 randomly selected individuals underwent routine manual office BP measurement on the same day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Manual BP was obtained using standardized methods (three consecutive readings at one-minute intervals following five minutes of rest, with the second and third readings averaged together); AOBP was the average of five readings taken at one-minute intervals while the patient was alone in a room. Mean systolic AOBP was 6.4 mmHg lower than mean manual office BP; mean diastolic AOBP was lower by 2.5 mmHg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of 555 hypertensive patients, office-based readings obtained from AOBP were compared with conventional manual office measurements using daytime average ABPM as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Before randomization, mean BP was similar in both groups <span class=\"nowrap\">(150/81</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">150/82</span> mmHg). After enrollment and randomization, the measured BP was significantly lower using the automated device <span class=\"nowrap\">(136/78</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">141/80</span> mmHg), although the mean daytime ABPM was not different between the groups <span class=\"nowrap\">(133/74</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">135/76</span> mmHg). In addition, AOBP readings were significantly closer than conventional manual readings to daytime ABPM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 309 patients, with each patient serving as his or her own control, mean office BP with a manual sphygmomanometer was <span class=\"nowrap\">152/87</span> mmHg; the mean BP in this population measured with an automated oscillometric device was <span class=\"nowrap\">132/75</span> mmHg, similar to the mean ambulatory daytime reading of <span class=\"nowrap\">134/77</span> mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>The definitions used to define hypertension are presented elsewhere.

Six to eight hours of ABPM may be adequate if full 24-hour readings cannot be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These BPs are recorded on the device, and the average day (diurnal) and night (nocturnal) BPs are determined from the data by a computer. The percentage of BP readings exceeding the upper limit of normal can also be calculated. When ABPM is used, hypertension is defined as a 24-hour average BP greater than or equal to <span class=\"nowrap\">125/75</span> mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

According to the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines published in 2011, ambulatory BP should be used to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension if office-based BP is elevated; home BP monitoring should be used to confirm the diagnosis in patients who cannot obtain or tolerate ambulatory monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The 2015 statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends obtaining measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation of hypertension. ABPM is recommended as the reference standard, and home BP monitoring is acceptable as an alternative to ABPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A patient with elevated office-based BP but normal daytime ambulatory BP is considered to have office hypertension or &quot;white coat&quot; hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'White coat hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>Compared with ABPM, the sensitivity and specificity of office-based BP measurements are poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. This was shown in a systematic review of 20 studies including 5863 patients that compared ABPM with office-based and home BP monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When compared with a mean 24-hour BP of <span class=\"nowrap\">135/85</span> mmHg or greater, the average sensitivity and specificity of an office-based BP of <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg or greater were both 75 percent. The positive predictive value for an elevated office-based measurement was poor. If, for example, the prevalence of hypertension in the population was 30 percent, the probability that a patient whose office-based BP was <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg or greater would have hypertension confirmed by ABPM was 56 percent. In addition to problems with accuracy, conventional office-based measurement of BP may be a less cost-effective way to diagnose hypertension than ABPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, ABPM is not available in most clinicians' offices. This is due to a combination of factors, including lack of knowledge regarding its utility, its expense, and minimal reimbursement by third-party payers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10945925\"><span class=\"h2\">Home blood pressure monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In view of the cost and limited availability of ambulatory monitoring, increasing attention is being given to home monitoring with inexpensive (USD $40 to $60) semi-automatic devices. If the BP is taken at home to establish the diagnosis of hypertension or to assess BP control, the optimal schedule is unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that at least 12 to 14 measurements should be obtained, with both morning and evening measurements taken, over a period of one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/9,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15-18</a>].

Various trials have shown that home monitoring can improve BP control and compliance. This issue is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Home blood pressure measurements'</a>.)</p><p>All home monitors should be checked for accuracy, initially and then at least annually, in the clinician's office, and patients or caregivers should be able to demonstrate the correct technique of BP measurement. When using home monitoring in obese patients, appropriately sized arm cuffs may be unavailable; in these situations, wrist cuffs may be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6381476\"><span class=\"h3\">Cuff inflation hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some BP monitors designed for home use, particularly ones that are less expensive, require the patient to manually inflate the cuff. If the cuff is manually inflated, the muscular activity used to inflate the cuff can acutely raise the BP by as much as <span class=\"nowrap\">12/9</span> mmHg, an effect that dissipates within 5 to 20 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, inflating the cuff to at least 30 rather than 20 mmHg above systolic and then allowing the sphygmomanometer to fall no more than 2 to 3 mmHg per heartbeat is desirable, both for accurate measurement and to permit this exertional effect to disappear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10945945\"><span class=\"h2\">Office-based blood pressure measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Office-based BP measurement may likely continue to be the primary technique for both the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the United States and elsewhere due in part to the lack of payment for ABPM or home BP monitors by most third-party payers and the unavailability of ABPM or home BP monitors in some areas. In addition, randomized trials upon which hypertension treatment recommendations are based employed office-based BP measurements, not ABPM or home BP measurements.</p><p>The remainder of this section will review the recommendations that have been made to achieve maximum accuracy in office-based BP measurement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65136 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, many clinicians <strong>do not follow</strong> one or more of these recommendations, leading to potential errors in diagnosis and management and to the conclusion that office readings are simply unreliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The proper measurement of office-based BP requires attention to all of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time of measurement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of measurement device</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cuff size</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cuff placement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technique of measurement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of measurements</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3214368636\"><span class=\"h3\">Routine office-based blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinicians' offices do <strong>not</strong> use an automated oscillometric BP (AOBP) device but rather measure BP manually (using the auscultatory method) or with an oscillometric device while a medical professional is present in the room with the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h4\">Time of measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BP is variable throughout the course of the day, as shown clearly by ABPM.

This phenomenon, called &quot;white coat&quot; or isolated office hypertension, should be suspected in any patient with markedly elevated office BP in the absence of end-organ damage or with normal ambulatory BPs taken at work or at home. The presence of white coat hypertension can be confirmed by 24-hour ABPM or self-recorded readings at home. This white coat effect can usually be minimized by having a nurse measure the BP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73781\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73781 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and by using automated BP devices which record multiple readings with the patient alone in the examination room.

The cuff should be inflated to a pressure approximately 30 mmHg greater than systolic, as estimated from the disappearance of the pulse in the brachial artery by palpation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Initial estimation of the systolic pressure by palpation avoids potential problems with an <strong>auscultatory gap</strong>, wherein the Korotkoff sounds transiently disappear as the cuff is deflated. As an example, the Korotkoff sounds in a patient with a systolic pressure of 180 mmHg may be first heard at 180 mmHg, disappear at 165 mmHg, and then be reheard at 140 mmHg. If the cuff is only inflated to a pressure of 160 mmHg, no sounds will be heard until 140 mmHg; as a result, the latter value will be mistakenly considered to be the systolic pressure.</p><p>With the auscultatory method, the stethoscope should be placed lightly over the brachial artery since the use of excessive pressure can increase turbulence and delay the disappearance of sound. The net effect is that the diastolic pressure reading may be artifactually reduced by up to 10 to 15 mmHg.</p><p>The cuff should be deflated slowly at a rate of 2 to 3 mmHg per heartbeat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The systolic pressure is the pressure at which the pulse is first heard by auscultation (Korotkoff phase I).</p><p>As the cuff is deflated below the systolic pressure, the pulse continues to be heard until there is abrupt muffling (phase IV) and, approximately 8 to 10 mmHg later, disappearance of sound (phase V). There is general consensus that phase V should be used to determine diastolic blood pressure in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671601842\"><span class=\"h5\">Oscillometric method of measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oscillometric devices have an electronic pressure sensor to record the pressure oscillations of the arteries and automatically inflate and deflate the cuff.

If there is a large disparity due to a unilateral arterial lesion (usually a subclavian stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]), the arm with higher pressure should be used.</p><p>A disparity in BP between the arms predicts not only the presence of subclavian stenosis but also a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. In a meta-analysis that included 20 studies, patients who had a BP disparity of 10 mmHg or more between the arms were significantly more likely to have peripheral arterial disease (42 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

If the second value is more than 5 mmHg different from the first, continued measurements should be made until a stable value is attained.

A study of 444 men with longstanding, poorly controlled hypertension found that a single clinic or home systolic BP of 120 to 157 mmHg had less than an 80 percent chance of correctly classifying the patient as being in or out of control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Although these office measurements are recommended to identify patients who might have hypertension, many such individuals will not have hypertension upon further testing (ie, they have white coat hypertension). Our approach to measuring BP for the purposes of diagnosing and confirming hypertension depends in part upon the feasibility of performing ABPM, home BP monitoring, and, if neither ABPM nor home BP monitoring are feasible, whether or not an automated oscillometric BP (AOBP) device is used in the clinician's office (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F105050\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105050 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1918444248\" class=\"local\">'Selecting a measurement strategy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We perform ABPM if it is feasible to establish a diagnosis of hypertension.

(See <a href=\"#H10945925\" class=\"local\">'Home blood pressure monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If home BP monitoring is not feasible (patient cannot afford a cuff or find a suitably sized cuff), then BP must be measured in the office. However, if office BP is used to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension, multiple measurements on different days are required (see <a href=\"#H10945945\" class=\"local\">'Office-based blood pressure measurement'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If the office has an AOBP device that can automatically take and average multiple measurements with the patient <strong>alone</strong> in a room, then we use this technique to measure BP.
