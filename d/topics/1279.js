A major goal of the initial evaluation is to identify disorders that require specific treatments (eg, parasitic infection, drug hypersensitivity, leukemia, non-hematologic cancer). </p><p>The peripheral blood eosinophil count does not accurately predict the risk of organ damage in all patients. Although complications of eosinophilia are more common in patients with higher eosinophil counts (eg, &gt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL),</span> a patient with mild peripheral blood eosinophilia may have significant organ involvement by eosinophils. Thus, it is also important to consider the clinical status of the patient and to determine whether there is evidence of end-organ involvement.</p><p>This topic presents our approach to determining the underlying cause of unexplained peripheral blood eosinophilia. Disorders with eosinophilic involvement of specific organs are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophil-biology-and-causes-of-eosinophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophil biology and causes of eosinophilia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-pulmonary-eosinophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of pulmonary eosinophilia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The significance of urinary eosinophils&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the following terms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absolute eosinophil count</strong> &ndash; The absolute eosinophil count refers to the number of circulating eosinophils in the peripheral blood (in <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span>. It is determined by multiplying the total white blood cell (WBC) count by the percentage of eosinophils. Some laboratories report this calculated number directly, while others require the clinician to make the calculation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eosinophilia</strong> &ndash; Eosinophilia refers to an absolute eosinophil count in the peripheral blood of &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL;</span> this is considered abnormal in most laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unexplained-eosinophilia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The degree of eosinophilia can also be categorized as mild (500 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL),</span> moderate (1500 to 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL),</span> or severe (&gt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The typical percentage of eosinophils in an individual without eosinophilia is less than 5 percent, but the presence of eosinophilia cannot be determined based on the eosinophil percentage alone, because this percentage is a relative number that varies with the total WBC count and the relative percentages of other WBCs (eg, neutrophils, lymphocytes). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypereosinophilia (HE)</strong> &ndash; Hypereosinophilia (HE) is defined as moderate to severe eosinophilia (ie, &ge;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL)</span>. End-organ manifestations may be present, but are not required for the HE designation. When the cause of the eosinophilia is unknown and clinical manifestations are absent, patients with hypereosinophilia are considered to have hypereosinophilia of unknown significance (HE<sub>US</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unexplained-eosinophilia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Only the following two features are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unexplained-eosinophilia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypereosinophilia (ie, absolute eosinophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;1500/microL)</span> on at least two occasions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs of organ dysfunction attributable to the eosinophilia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Historically, the terms &quot;HES&quot; and &quot;idiopathic HES&quot; have been used to describe eosinophilia <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;1500/microL</span> associated with end organ dysfunction attributable to the eosinophilia in which the cause is unknown. From a practical standpoint, however, it is important to recognize that 1) end organ manifestations of eosinophilia can be identical irrespective of the cause; 2) the etiology of the eosinophilia may not be evident at presentation but may be determined later; and 3) some individuals with moderate to severe eosinophilia remain asymptomatic or develop signs of organ dysfunction many years after the eosinophilia is first noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unexplained-eosinophilia/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Furthermore, with the availability of new diagnostic tests and targeted therapies, the ability to identify specific etiologies of HES continues to grow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In view of the clinical heterogeneity of HE and HES, there have been many attempts to develop a classification system in order to better direct clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unexplained-eosinophilia/abstract/4-6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,8,9</a>]. For example, some experts subdivide HES into myeloproliferative syndrome-type HES (M-HES), in which clinical features point towards a myeloproliferative disorder; and lymphoid HES (L-HES), in which T cell production of cytokines, such as IL-5, leads to overproduction of eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unexplained-eosinophilia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, none of the available classification systems is perfect, and the majority of patients with HES (eg, up to two-thirds) do not fit neatly into a specific category. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">From the perspective of patient management, a more important distinction is whether the treatment should be directed at the eosinophilia or at another condition that is stimulating eosinophil production (eg, parasitic infection, drug hypersensitivity, non-hematologic cancer). (See <a href=\"#H7341728\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary (or neoplastic) hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)</strong> &ndash; Primary (neoplastic) HES refers to a myeloproliferative neoplasm that produces a predominance of mature eosinophils.

The degree of eosinophilia is rarely helpful for identifying the cause, except at extremes of eosinophil counts (eg, very mild eosinophilia may be associated with asthma or allergic rhinitis; very severe eosinophilia [ie, &ge;20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL]</span> is more likely to be caused by a myeloproliferative neoplasm). The disorders that can cause eosinophilia are best distinguished by the patient's history, clinical presentation, and specific laboratory testing. A more detailed discussion of the causes of eosinophilia is found separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the acute illness appears to be due to organ dysfunction (possibly caused by tissue eosinophil infiltration), or if an appropriate alternate therapy is not identified, urgent therapy directed at reducing eosinophilia (eg, high dose glucocorticoids) should be initiated. Ideally, baseline laboratory testing to determine the potential cause of the eosinophilia is sent before initiating urgent therapy, because therapy may obscure the underlying cause. However, urgent therapy should not be delayed while attempting to obtain, or awaiting results of, this testing. (See <a href=\"#H16146563\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypereosinophilic-syndromes-treatment#H351937905\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Immediate treatment for severe disease'</a>.) </p><p>The risk of dissemination of strongyloides in the setting of glucocorticoid therapy necessitates that individuals with potential exposure to strongyloides infection be treated empirically for strongyloides with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> daily for two days). This applies to all individuals with potential exposure, even if the serology is negative, because the reliability of serologic testing is variable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strongyloidiasis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strongyloidiasis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strongyloidiasis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strongyloidiasis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4736163\"><span class=\"h2\">Outpatient with signs of organ involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral blood eosinophilia does not correlate well with the extent of tissue damage except at the extremes of absolute eosinophil counts. Thus, signs of organ dysfunction should be addressed promptly, regardless of the level of blood eosinophilia. Helminth infections are among the most common causes worldwide. In the developed world, allergies and asthma predominate overall, and drug hypersensitivity is common in those with eosinophils counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1500/microL</span>. </p><p>For a patient with signs of organ involvement who is not acutely ill or hospitalized, the pace of the evaluation and the need for specialist referral depends on the specific organ involved and the degree of organ dysfunction. In many cases, initial testing can be done in the outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"#H7341756\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation and other testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H473636\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7342194\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidental finding, healthy individual</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eosinophilia discovered as an incidental finding on a complete blood count in an otherwise healthy individual can be evaluated on an outpatient basis. The initial evaluation should include a complete history, physical examination, and baseline laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"#H7341756\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation and other testing'</a> below.)</p><p>If signs of organ involvement are found on the initial evaluation or develop during this evaluation, the patient may need to be seen more urgently by a physician experienced in evaluating eosinophilic disorders <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> admitted to the hospital. (See <a href=\"#H473636\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> below.)</p><p>The patient with no signs of organ involvement should undergo periodic monitoring for the development of organ involvement at six month intervals. (See <a href=\"#H16146563\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing'</a> below.)</p><p>In some cases, eosinophilia resolves without treatment. Potential explanations for resolution of eosinophilia include removal of an offending agent (ie, transient exposure); clearance of an infection; and downregulation of host responses (as has been reported in the setting of chronic helminth infection). The expected time course of resolution of eosinophilia after a transient exposure is unknown, although in the case of drug hypersensitivity and removal of the offending agent, resolution can take many months.</p><p>The optimal evaluation of the asymptomatic traveler or immigrant with eosinophilia is uncertain. Up to 50 percent of such patients never have a cause of their eosinophilia identified despite exhaustive evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unexplained-eosinophilia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H228074\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The likely causes of eosinophilia in children and our approach to the evaluation of children are identical to that in adults with a few exceptions. Asthma and atopic disease remain the most common causes of mild to moderate eosinophilia in children; however, close attention should be paid to the frequency and etiology of infections, since immunodeficiency syndromes typically present in childhood and can be associated with atopic disease and peripheral blood and tissue eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-humoral-immunodeficiencies-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary humoral immunodeficiencies: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with recurrent infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis are also more common causes of eosinophilia in the pediatric age group and can be missed if an appropriate history is not elicited; the only clue to the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis in a child may be occasional vomiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since helminth infections require appropriate exposure, some infections are more or less prevalent in children. As an example, visceral larva migrans, which requires ingestion of eggs from soil contaminated with animal feces, is seen almost exclusively in young children; whereas filariasis, which requires repeated exposure to the bites of infected insect vectors, increases with age and is rare in children under four years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxocariasis: Visceral and ocular larva migrans&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some forms of leukemia and lymphoma (eg, pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) are more common in childhood and can present with asymptomatic eosinophilia, sometimes several years before the malignancy is detected. In contrast, solid tumors are rarely the cause of eosinophilia in children. Although definitive data are lacking, the prevalence of other rare causes of eosinophilia, including <span class=\"nowrap\">FIP1L1/PDGFRA-positive</span> myeloproliferative neoplasms, eosinophilic granulomatosis and polyangiitis, and episodic angioedema and eosinophilia, appear to be comparable in children and adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7341742\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should have a thorough history that addresses symptoms of organ involvement, medical conditions, exposures (medications, foods, over-the-counter remedies, travel, and occupational and recreational exposures), and prior eosinophil counts. Family history may also be helpful in rare cases of familial hematologic syndromes.

Examples include a risk for strongyloides infection in miners, a risk for ascariasis in slaughterhouse workers, and a risk for schistosomiasis in river rafters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7345408\"><span class=\"h3\">Medications and over the counter remedies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eosinophilia can be caused by almost any prescription or nonprescription drug, herbal remedy, or dietary supplement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F84015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef84015 \">table 2</a>). Thus, a detailed review of past, current, and over-the-counter medications and remedies should be elicited. The temporal relationship between administration of the medication or herbal remedy may be helpful, but the time course of eosinophilia does not always follow a consistent pattern. Although drug-induced eosinophilia is often accompanied by fever, rash, or other clinical manifestations, signs and symptoms may be absent. </p><p>In a prospective cohort study of 824 patients receiving prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy as outpatients, 25 percent developed eosinophilia (peak absolute eosinophil count ranging from 500 to <span class=\"nowrap\">8610/mL,</span> median <span class=\"nowrap\">726/mL)</span> after a median of 15 days of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unexplained-eosinophilia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with eosinophilia had a significantly higher likelihood of rash (15 versus 6 percent; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 4.16) or renal injury (15 versus 10 percent; adjusted HR, 2.13), compared with patients without eosinophilia. Liver injury was comparable between the two groups. DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome or possible DRESS, occurred in seven patients, four of whom were receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>. </p><p>Medication-associated eosinophilia per se does not mandate cessation of medication administration but rather requires careful consideration of the following questions: a) are there clinical manifestations in association with the eosinophilia that would dictate changing the medication, b) are there alternative medications (eg, antibiotics, seizure meds) that could be substituted, or is the likely medication the preferred or required therapy. It is also important to realize that eosinophilia may not resolve for weeks to months after discontinuation of the offending agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7345414\"><span class=\"h3\">Foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary history should ascertain the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat because incompletely cooked pork containing encysted larvae is a source of trichinellosis. Ingestion of soil or vegetables contaminated by excrement from infected dogs or cats can cause toxocariasis, and undercooked or raw crab or crayfish can transmit paragonimiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichinellosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichinellosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxocariasis: Visceral and ocular larva migrans&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragonimiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragonimiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7345421\"><span class=\"h3\">Travel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of residence in or recent travel to a parasite-endemic area may be helpful in suggesting a parasitic etiology of eosinophilia. However, a lack of recent travel should not eliminate parasitic infection as a potential cause of eosinophilia, especially for helminths with a worldwide distribution <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a long latency period. As an example, foreign military service, even decades earlier, could be a source of strongyloides infection, which occurs via penetration of the skin upon contact with soil or water contaminated by human feces. This history may be omitted unless it is specifically queried.

As an example, <em>Loa loa</em> infection is endemic only in Central and West Africa, whereas gnathostomiasis has a worldwide distribution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71472 \">table 3</a>). Consequently, a patient presenting with migratory angioedema without a history of travel to Africa should be evaluated for some causes of migratory angioedema (eg, gnathostomiasis), but not for loiasis (eg, such an individual does not require a midday blood smear or filarial serology). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-lesions-in-the-returning-traveler\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin lesions in the returning traveler&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to helminthic parasites, most pathogens responsible for travelers' diarrhea, including bacteria and protozoan parasites (eg, <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Entamoeba</em>), generally do not cause eosinophilia.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophil-biology-and-causes-of-eosinophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophil biology and causes of eosinophilia&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important steps in evaluating an individual with eosinophilia are assessing the presence and degree of <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/organ</span> involvement, which determines the urgency of the evaluation; and determining the etiology, which has major implications for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H7341728\" class=\"local\">'Overview of our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An acutely ill patient with eosinophilia, or an individual with an extremely high eosinophil count (eg, &ge;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL),</span> requires hospitalization and urgent evaluation for the cause of the eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"#H16146531\" class=\"local\">'Acutely ill patient or extremely high eosinophil count'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For a patient with signs of organ involvement who is not acutely ill or hospitalized, the pace of the evaluation and the need for specialist referral depends on the specific organ involved and the degree of organ dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H4736163\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient with signs of organ involvement'</a> above and <a href=\"#H473636\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eosinophilia discovered as an incidental finding on a complete blood count in an otherwise healthy individual can be evaluated on an outpatient basis. (See <a href=\"#H7342194\" class=\"local\">'Incidental finding, healthy individual'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The likely causes of eosinophilia in children with eosinophilia are identical to adults with a few exceptions. Children may be more likely to have asthma and atopic disease; immunodeficiency syndromes; food allergy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eosinophilic esophagitis; and some forms of leukemia. Visceral larva migrans is seen almost exclusively in young children, whereas filariasis increases with age and is rare in children under four years. (See <a href=\"#H228074\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should have a thorough history that addresses symptoms of organ involvement, medical conditions, exposures (medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F84015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef84015 \">table 2</a>), over-the-counter remedies, travel, foods, and occupational and recreational exposures), and prior eosinophil counts. The physical examination should focus on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71472 \">table 3</a>), eyes, nose, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic systems, and the presence of splenomegaly. (See <a href=\"#H7341742\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7341749\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a series of initial laboratory tests for all patients with unexplained eosinophilia of &ge;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/microL</span> on two separate occasions, any patient with signs of organ involvement, or any individual with a history of travel to a parasite endemic area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94485 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16146563\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing or a trial of drug discontinuation may be warranted in selected patients (eg, additional parasite serologies depending on exposure history; serum immunoglobulin levels for those with recurrent infections or signs of autoimmune disease; serum tryptase levels in those with findings of myeloproliferative disorders, skin lesions of urticaria pigmentosa, or a history of anaphylaxis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94485 \">table 4</a>). Referral to a clinician who specializes in eosinophilia is appropriate if a thorough evaluation has been conducted and the cause of persistent eosinophilia is not found. (See <a href=\"#H16146675\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing in selected patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14961441\" class=\"local\">'Testing for other parasites and infections'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7344482\" class=\"local\">'Trial of drug discontinuation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H473636\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is appropriate for individuals with findings that suggest a potential primary hematologic cause of eosinophilia (eg, hypereosinophilia, organ involvement, dysplastic or immature white blood cells on the peripheral blood smear). If bone marrow testing is done, the sample should be evaluated for abnormalities of eosinophilic precursors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F88547\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88547 \">picture 1</a>), with special stains for reticulin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mast cells if indicated, along with cytogenetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specific molecular testing for hematologic neoplasms associated with eosinophilia.
