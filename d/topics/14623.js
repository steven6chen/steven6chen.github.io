However, we and other clinicians experienced in the care of severely ill patients, value the information that can be obtained from PAC placement in the select populations listed above. In non-critically-ill patients, the insertion of PACs is most commonly performed during the evaluation of patients with suspected or known pulmonary hypertension, the details of which are discussed separately.

A large, retrospective analysis of PA catheters in high risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery, however, failed to demonstrate a benefit on morbidity and mortality and, further, was associated with longer length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and increased duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

However, PACs are occasionally inserted in patients with shock in whom a diagnosis has not been achieved with this approach, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in patients with unknown intravascular volume status who have been actively resuscitated but remain in shock. In addition, PAC placement in this population can facilitate management decisions regarding fluids and vasopressors as well as evaluate the hemodynamic response to mechanical ventilator changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68139\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68139 \">table 1</a>).

Patients who underwent PAC had an increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1.24) compared to those who did not undergo the procedure. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any group in which PAC was associated with an improved outcome. Despite flaws in the methodological design of this study (eg, influence of vasopressor use, interpreter error) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>], additional small randomized studies and meta-analyses have similarly concluded no benefit when PACs are placed (survival or length of hospital stay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/8,14,17,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,17,23-25</a>]. Consequently, PACs are no longer used in the routine management of critically ill patients with shock but are reserved for those in whom the acquisition of hemodynamic measurements may help to classify the type of shock (eg, distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive) or facilitate management decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

They may also be placed when there is a need to differentiate between cardiogenic and non cardiogenic pulmonary edema (eg, when echocardiography is not helpful). The PAC can also be useful in the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade when clinical evaluation and echocardiography are unhelpful but the suspicion remains.

As an example, one randomized study of 433 patients with heart failure (ESCAPE) reported no difference in mortality (10 versus 9 percent), or the length of hospital stay (8.7 versus 8.3 days) between those who had or did not have a PAC in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

However, some experts place PACs perioperatively for select patients considered at high risk for hemodynamic compromise intraoperatively or postoperatively. Examples include those with congenital heart disease, left to right shunt, severe valvular disease, or severe underlying cardiopulmonary disease who are undergoing corrective or other surgery. &#160;</p><p>Similar to patients who are critically ill, the routine use of PACs perioperatively is of unclear benefit. A large, multicenter trial randomly assigned nearly 2000 high-risk (ASA class III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 2</a>)) patients ages 60 years or older undergoing cardiac, vascular, or orthopedic surgery to perioperative management with or without a PAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients without a PAC in place were managed on the basis of directly measured central venous pressure and other clinical parameters. There were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality (7.8 versus 7.7 percent) or in one-year mortality (17 versus 16 percent) between the two groups. In addition, a higher rate of pulmonary embolism was reported in the PAC group (0.9 versus 0 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103537499\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under rare circumstances, aspirates from a wedged catheter can be used to diagnose lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and may lend support to the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. While PACS can be useful in this regard, they are rarely placed specifically for this purpose because they are generally insensitive diagnostically.

While a bleeding diathesis increases the risk of hemorrhage, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances increase the risk of persistent life-threatening arrhythmias. Correction of these laboratory abnormalities is required prior to inserting the catheter. &#160;</p><p>The insertion of a PAC in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger's syndrome is considered high risk (due to the risk of pulmonary artery rupture). Other high risk patients include those with right or left bundle branch block (risk of complete heart block), a defibrillator or pacemaker (risk of displacement), prosthetic or stenotic tricuspid or pulmonary valve (difficult catheter advancement), latex allergy (most catheters have latex), a persistent left superior vena cava (misplacement to the left atrium), and right atrial or ventricular masses (difficult catheter advancement). However, a PAC may be placed for a well-defined indication in these populations usually under fluoroscopic guidance with appropriate resuscitative equipment in place, preferably in a center with expertise in right heart catheter placement.

If the answer could change management, then placement of the catheter is appropriate. Thus, there is no indication for the routine use of PACs in the intensive care unit or intraoperatively such that clinicians should carefully consider the clinical risks and benefits on a patient-by-patient basis. Importantly, clinicians overseeing catheter placement and collection of hemodynamic data from PACs should be able to assess the quality of the data and reproducibly interpret the results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Right heart catheterization is frequently performed in patients with clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> echocardiographic suspicion of <strong>pulmonary arterial hypertension</strong> so that a definitive diagnosis can be obtained.

Less commonly, catheter misplacement or knotting can occur. Perforation of a cardiac chamber and rupture of a cardiac valve or the pulmonary artery are rare complications that can be catastrophic. Many of these complications can be minimized, but not eliminated, by paying careful attention to the pressure waveforms during insertion and by ensuring that the balloon at the tip of the catheter is fully inflated, so that the catheter tip does not protrude beyond the balloon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59475 \">figure 1</a>).

However, potentially serious rhythm disorders can be seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sustained ventricular arrhythmias (&gt;30 consecutive ventricular contractions) occur in up to 3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, because it is an uncommon occurrence, prophylactic use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> is not recommended nor is it of proven benefit prior to PAC placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. When such severe rhythm disturbances are seen and not eliminated by advancement into the pulmonary artery or balloon deflation and catheter withdrawal, they should be treated according to the usual ACLS protocol. Importantly, significant ventricular arrhythmias may be mitigated by correcting electrolyte and acid-base disturbances prior to insertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H968965813\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right bundle branch block develops during approximately 5 percent of catheter insertions, thereby placing patients with preexisting left bundle branch block (LBBB) at risk for complete heart block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Although the risk is low and complete heart block is usually transient, catheter insertion should not be undertaken in patients with LBBB without the ability to institute immediate cardiac pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This can be accomplished by placement of a transthoracic or transvenous pacer, or by using a PAC with an intraluminal pacing electrode. In many centers, pulmonary artery catheterization in the setting of a LBBB is performed under fluoroscopic guidance to expedite passage of the catheter tip through the right ventricle and decrease the risk of inducing complete heart block.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103540502\"><span class=\"h3\">Misplacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Difficulty placing the PAC can occur during insertion due to looping of the catheter inside the right atrium or right ventricle as well as due to anatomic vascular anomalies (eg, atrial septal defect).

It may also be recognized on chest radiograph. When knotting is strongly suspected, the catheter should <strong>not</strong> be withdrawn and imaging, usually chest radiograph but occasionally computed tomography, should be obtained for diagnosis. The knot may be relieved by injecting 10 to 20 mL of cold sterile saline or of iced solution prepared for cardiac output measurement through the distal lumen (&quot;stiffens&quot; the tip); the PAC can then be removed transvenously. However, some patients require placement of a guidewire in a cardiac catheter laboratory under fluoroscopic guidance venotomy, or even surgical extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H968968647\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocardial, vessel, or valve rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocardial injury and valve inflammation or damage can occur during PAC insertion which may be asymptomatic and transient.

This complication may occur during insertion, but often occurs later when the catheter has inadvertently migrated into a distal position in the pulmonary artery. Rupture can be due to perforation by the catheter tip or balloon overinflation. It should be suspected in a patient with a PAC who presents with brisk hemoptysis. While some cases are not life-threatening and can be managed conservatively, hemoptysis is often massive and usually requires emergent thoracotomy for management. In addition, when pulmonary artery rupture is suspected or confirmed, the catheter should be removed. Details regarding the management of hemoptysis are discussed separately.
