An additional 34 percent of patients were receiving concurrent analgesia or anesthetic therapy for other reasons during the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors associated with greater use of specific preprocedural analgesia included prematurity, the type of procedure, parental presence, surgery, daytime, and day of procedure after the first day of admission.

Infants exposed to circumcision pain at birth experienced greater pain at immunization four to six months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], whereas those exposed to gastric suctioning at birth evidenced threefold greater odds of developing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) during adolescence or adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Adolescents born preterm also display higher somatic pain sensitivity than adolescents born at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These findings and other animal studies substantiate the theory that repeated exposure to neonatal pain leads to permanent changes in pain processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Neuroanatomical and behavioral changes have also been reported in adult animals that were exposed to neonatal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. In one study, exposure to persistent hind paw pain in newborn rats induced changes in primary afferent neurons and their spinal neuronal circuits in adult animals, both at baseline and following sensory stimulation, compared with control animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Another study showed that the neuroanatomical and behavioral changes following repetitive inflammatory pain resulted from neuronal excitotoxicity, which was ameliorated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Frequency of exposure to neonatal pain-related stress have been correlated with subsequent impairments in cognitive development, altered neurocognitive processing, decreased cortical thickness, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Thus, it is essential to identify, assess, and manage neonatal pain effectively in order to minimize its impact on the intermediate- and long-term outcomes of preterm or term newborns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PAIN ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207844053\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A neonatal pain control program that includes routine pain assessment should be established for each healthcare facility that cares for neonates and young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Given these challenges and concerns, some authors have questioned whether scoring methods that assess pain intensity are even required for neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. They propose instead a &quot;pain detection method,&quot; which takes into account the type of the noxious stimulus, the body region being stimulated, and simplifies the pain assessment to identify whether pain is present or not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Although novel, the validity, feasibility, and clinical utility of this approach have not been investigated.</p><p>As a result, we continue to monitor for neonatal pain on a routine basis using validated pain assessment tools, which have been the focus of mandatory training for the clinical staff.

The definition of prolonged or chronic pain in newborns remains unclear, which has led to challenges for research in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. As a result, tools for the assessment of persistent or prolonged pain in neonates (due to major surgery, osteomyelitis, or necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC]) have not been developed or completely validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/63,68,80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,68,80,81</a>]. During episodes of persistent pain, neonates may enter a passive state, with limited or no body movements, an expressionless face, reduced variability in heart rate and respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/53,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,71</a>]. Thus, assessment tools based on these indicators will not adequately detect and assess the intensity of prolonged neonatal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/71,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The EDIN (Echelle de Douleur et d'Inconfort du Nouveau-n&eacute;) and COMFORTneo scale were tools developed specifically for assessing prolonged neonatal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].

As a general rule, anything that causes pain in adults or older children will also cause pain in neonates, regardless of their GA. If parents are available, we ask for their opinion: Do they feel that their baby is in pain? In cases in which there is a likelihood of pain or perceived pain, we suggest that pain control measures be administered pre-emptively to prevent or reduce pain due to known noxious stimuli.</p><p>Although not universally available, measures of neonatal stress (eg, skin conductance activity) may be indicative of pain.

In a multicenter observational study, the documentation of clinician pain assessment was significantly associated with the use of pharmacologic analgesia after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In contrast, the type of surgery (major or minor) was not associated with the administration of pharmacologic therapy. Thus, each facility that cares for infants should adopt an assessment strategy for the detection and documentation of pain.</p><p>Institution of a pain management program increases the awareness of the staff that pain occurs routinely in the NICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/54,75,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,75,84</a>] and that its control is an important clinical goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/1,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,85,86</a>]. The effective use of a clinical assessment tool requires mandatory training of the staff to improve interobserver reliability and to educate the staff on the limitations of the selected tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-neonatal-pain/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At our institution, we assess pain at least every four hours when vital signs are measured, and after each painful or therapeutic intervention.

This includes routine assessment by trained health care workers using standardized pain assessment tools that are appropriate for the neonatal population and clinical setting. However, clinicians need to be aware of limitations of these assessment instruments and altered patient responses due to neurologic impairment, prematurity, or neuromuscular blockade.
