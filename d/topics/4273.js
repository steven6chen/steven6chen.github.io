The physical urticarias are forms of inducible urticaria, in which there is a specific stimulus that triggers the development of symptoms. Cold urticaria is characterized by pruritic wheals (hives) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema due to cutaneous mast cell activation and release of proinflammatory mediators after cold exposure. Triggers include skin contact with cold objects, cold liquids, and cold air. The underlying pathophysiology is largely unknown but is likely to involve immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mast cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Cold urticaria is reviewed here. Other urticaria disorders, including acute and chronic spontaneous urticaria and other forms of inducible urticaria, including physical urticaria, are discussed separately.

Both sexes are affected with similar frequency in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>], although one study reported that females were affected twice as often as males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Up to one-half of patients with cold urticaria are atopic, and one-fourth have other types of inducible urticaria, most commonly symptomatic dermographism and cholinergic urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p>The incidence of cold urticaria was estimated to be 0.05 percent in Central Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The frequency of cold urticaria among physical urticaria subtypes varies between 5 and 34 percent, partly depending upon the geographic region (ie, higher incidences are found in regions with colder climates and lower rates are seen in regions with a warmer climate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/5,7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1778211\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold urticaria is a self-limited disorder in many patients. Remission, or at least improvement of symptoms, occurs in 50 percent of patients within five to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/2,5-7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7,12</a>]. The mean time to resolution in one study was 5.6&plusmn;3.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Recurrence of cold urticaria after remission is rare. However, some patients have the disorder for many years, and there are variant forms that appear to be lifelong (eg, familial atypical cold urticaria). (See <a href=\"#H3768741\" class=\"local\">'Variant forms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold urticaria symptoms result from the activation of mast cells and subsequent release of histamine and other proinflammatory mediators. Following a cold stimulation test (CST), cutaneous mast cells in patients with cold urticaria show signs of degranulation, and serum levels of mast cell mediators are increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. This results in pruritus, burning, and erythema from activation of skin nerves and vasodilation of skin vessels with extravasation causing wheals and angioedema. On skin biopsy, cold urticaria lacks a late-phase cellular infiltrate, similar to most other forms of physical urticaria (except delayed pressure urticaria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A variety of laboratory abnormalities have been found in patients with cold urticaria, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small series, the majority of patients with cold urticaria exhibited mast cell-activating anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associations noted in case reports include cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinins, anti-lamin-B antibodies, reduced levels of C1 esterase inhibitor and C4 and increased levels of platelet-activating factor and platelet factor 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4450715\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of diseases have been anecdotally associated with cold urticaria, largely in case reports. The causal relationship between these various disorders and cold urticaria is unknown.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associations have been reported with various infections, including viral, parasitic, and bacterial infections. Specific disorders include Lyme disease, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, acute toxoplasmosis, <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> colonization, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold urticaria has been associated with antecedent Hymenoptera stings, food and drug intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and hematologic, lymphatic, or neoplastic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of the most common form of cold urticaria consist of cutaneous wheals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema, which form after cold exposure. A subset of patients develops systemic reactions. Variant forms have specific characteristic features that can be elicited by a careful clinical history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23479940\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold urticaria is characterized by the development of wheal-and-flare skin reactions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema after the skin is exposed to cold air, liquids, or objects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50151\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50151 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Wheals and angioedema typically develop minutes after exposure and are usually limited to cold-exposed skin areas. Exposure to cold weather is one of the most common triggers for symptoms, with variables that include temperature, humidity, and wind chill factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23479947\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extensive cold contact, such as swimming in cold water, may result in systemic reactions, ranging from generalized urticaria to anaphylaxis, with symptoms involving the respiratory, gastrointestinal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiovascular systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a series of 30 children with cold urticaria seen in a tertiary referral center, one-third had a history of cold-induced anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another series of mostly adult patients, also from a tertiary referral clinic, nearly one-third experienced at least one severe systemic reaction with hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory compromise, and approximately one-half of patients reported milder cutaneous systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In these two studies, almost all patients reported either cutaneous or systemic symptoms triggered by aquatic activities, whereas only 30 percent experienced symptoms after touching a cold object.</p><p>Patients with cold urticaria who participate in aquatic activities (eg, swimming in cold water) are at risk of death both directly from anaphylaxis and indirectly from drowning during a reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/6,8,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,31</a>]. Patients with cold urticaria are also at risk of suffocation due to oropharyngeal angioedema after consuming cold foods or beverages, although it is unclear how commonly this occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4451196\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some risk factors or predictors of systemic reactions have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the pediatric study described above, the only risk factor identified was a history of a previous cold-induced systemic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, patients with a history of cold-induced oropharyngeal angioedema were at greater risk of a systemic reaction triggered by swimming, compared with those with a history of only a few hives after swimming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe systemic reactions may be more frequent in patients &lt;30 years old at disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Physical variables associated with systemic reactions include a greater surface area of skin exposed, exposure to lower temperatures, and longer duration of cold exposure. Exposure to cold water or solid objects that are cold is more likely to elicit symptoms than exposure to cold air. We also advise patients to pay attention to the wind chill factor during cold months, as symptoms will be more easily triggered on days when the wind chill is significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3768741\"><span class=\"h2\">Variant forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several variant forms of cold urticaria (atypical cold urticarias). In a retrospective review of 74 patients referred to a specialty center, nearly 30 percent of cold urticaria patients had atypical cold urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In all of these disorders, the standard cold stimulation test (CST) is negative. Each involves urticarial lesions, although the specific triggers, timing, or location of the lesions are different from classic cold urticaria. Some are acquired and others are hereditary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/15,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,33</a>]. Modified types of CST are needed to elicit the signs and symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H23480286\" class=\"local\">'Cold stimulation test'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed cold urticaria</strong> &ndash; There are both acquired and hereditary forms of delayed cold urticaria, all of which are rare. In these disorders, the wheal-and-flare reaction occurs up to 24 hours after cold exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Patients have no immediate response to CST but will develop a wheal-and-flare response at the test site, usually 18 to 24 hours later. In the familial form, hyperpigmentation typically develops at the site of lesions following resolution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Familial atypical cold urticaria</strong> &ndash; In this disorder, symptoms begin in early childhood and are lifelong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Localized urticaria typically develops on areas exposed to cold air, water, or objects. Symptoms triggered by cold food and beverages are also common. Systemic inflammatory symptoms are absent. CSTs were negative in the small number of patients described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A syndrome of familial cold urticaria related to deletions in the gene for phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma-2 was described in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Affected individuals have cold urticaria from childhood, although symptoms are elicited by evaporative cooling (eg, exposure to cold air or wind), rather than touching cold objects or water, and autoimmunity and immunodeficiency are each present in about one-half of patients. Investigators suggested the condition be called PLC-gamma-2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation, or PLAID.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cold-dependent dermographism</strong> &ndash; In this variant, the skin becomes dermographic when cooled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. To reproduce this, the skin should be stroked firmly while cool and then rewarmed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cold-induced cholinergic urticaria</strong> &ndash; Patients with this variant develop hives only when exercising in cold environments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The diagnosis is often made by clinical history alone and would be confirmed by exercise challenge in a cold room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic cold urticaria</strong> &ndash; In this form of cold urticaria, generalized urticaria is seen after systemic cold exposure. This form is not associated with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. CST is negative, and the diagnosis is usually based upon clinical history and confirmed by cold exposure in a cold room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Localized cold urticaria</strong> &ndash; Patients with localized cold urticaria develop hives following cold exposure but only at defined skin sites, such as the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Thus, the CST is positive only if performed at these sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Localized cold reflex urticaria</strong> &ndash; In this disorder, hives develop near (within a few centimeters) but not directly at the site of the ice cube challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with a suggestive clinical history, evaluation consists of a cold stimulation test (CST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/15,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,46,47</a>]. Modified types of testing are often needed for variant forms. Laboratory testing is not needed in routine cases of cold-induced urticaria in children or adults, although it is appropriate if the patient's symptoms are not typical for cold-induced urticaria or suggest the presence of systemic disease or an associated condition. (See <a href=\"#H4450715\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23480286\"><span class=\"h2\">Cold stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cold stimulation test (CST) can be performed by several different methods. All methods involve the application of a cold object to the skin and then removing the stimulus and allowing the skin to rewarm. The test is considered positive if the test site shows a palpable and clearly visible wheal-and-flare skin reaction upon rewarming. The affected site is pruritic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated with a burning sensation in most cases. The test is considered negative if there is no reaction or erythema or <span class=\"nowrap\">pruritus/burning</span> only.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23480071\"><span class=\"h3\">Ice cube test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ice cube test, which requires no special equipment, involves placing an ice cube and a small amount of water in a thin plastic bag, allowing a few minutes for the ice and water temperatures to equilibrate and then placing the bag against the skin (usually of the volar forearm) for 5 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The bag is then removed and response is assessed 10 minutes after removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F95909\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95909 \">picture 2</a>). This method is readily performed in most offices and has a sensitivity of 83 to 90 percent and a specificity of 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/6,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,46</a>]. Longer periods of exposure are rarely needed.</p><p>If no wheal has developed, we revisit the history. Sometimes, a variant form of cold urticaria is present. As an example, we might ask the patient again if there are only certain areas of the body on which cold-induced wheals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema have formed in the past (suggesting localized cold urticaria). Modified testing can sometimes elicit a positive test. (See <a href=\"#H3768741\" class=\"local\">'Variant forms'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817261147\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing methods that are not recommended</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold provocation testing using cold packs or cold water baths is <strong>not</strong> recommended for first-line screening, because these methods expose larger areas of skin to cold and may induce systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. Rather, they are usually used to evaluate patients in whom the ice cube or TempTest method was negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817261153\"><span class=\"h3\">Natural exposure testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some situations, the most logical way to diagnose a cold-induced disorder is to ask the patient to re-expose <span class=\"nowrap\">himself/herself</span> to the conditions (eg, cold wind, cold water) that elicited the signs and symptoms in the first place, if safe and feasible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4448940\"><span class=\"h3\">Specialized testing devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TempTest 4.0 is a thermoelectric device that was developed, validated, and licensed as a commercially available medical product. TempTest 4.0 allows for CSTs, including threshold measurements, with a continuous gradient of temperatures ranging from 4 to 44&deg;C (39 to 111&deg;F) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F95911\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95911 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23480278\" class=\"local\">'Threshold testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23480278\"><span class=\"h2\">Threshold testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author's approach in patients who show a positive initial test reaction is to further define a temperature threshold for the individual patient using the TempTest 4.0 device. The critical temperature threshold is the highest temperature sufficient to induce a positive test reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F95910\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95910 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Threshold testing is not necessary for the diagnosis, although the information can help patients avoid risky situations by knowing what temperatures are likely to elicit symptoms. It can also be used to monitor treatment responses without repeatedly exposing the patient to situations that induce symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>A study of 45 patients with cold urticaria found a mean (+ standard error of the mean) critical temperature threshold of 17 (+ 6&deg;C) or approximately 63 (+ 11&deg;F) (range 4 to 27&deg;C or approximately 39 to 81&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Thus, patients' thresholds may vary significantly. Patients with higher threshold temperatures are considered to have more severe disease, although disease severity does not appear to predict response to antihistamine therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4449650\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> below.)</p><p>One important caveat about threshold determinations is the following. There are no data indicating that threshold levels are the same whether the area of exposure is localized, such as exposure of the face to a cold wind, versus a large area, such as submersion in cold water. We advise patients that if they are faced with a situation in which symptoms might occur (such as swimming in a pool), they can expose a limited area of the body first (eg, submerge a hand) and then wait to see if symptoms appear before exposing the rest of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263705372\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with an appropriate clinical history, the diagnosis of cold urticaria is confirmed by the presence of a positive cold stimulation test (CST).

Cold stimulation tests (CSTs) would be negative if performed in patients with these disorders. Patients do not develop typical urticaria, distinguishing these disorders from typical or variant forms of cold urticaria.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with FCAS present within the first few months of life. The development of a papular rash after cold exposure is often delayed by up to several hours. This form is associated with systemic inflammatory symptoms, including fever, conjunctival injection, and arthralgias. The presence of systemic symptoms distinguishes this disorder from simple cold urticaria. FCAS is considered a hereditary periodic fever syndrome.

Cold-induced systemic inflammation (eg, fever, arthralgias) or purpuric lesions in response to cold suggest other disorders. (See <a href=\"#H4450715\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of cold exposure is the best prophylaxis, although complete avoidance is difficult for most patients. Patients should be educated about high-risk activities and situations, such as swimming, surgery, and ingestion of cold foods and beverages. (See <a href=\"#H4449202\" class=\"local\">'Education about high-risk activities and cold avoidance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors for those patients with a history of anaphylaxis, systemic symptoms, frequent or unavoidable cold exposure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a high temperature threshold. We advise such patients to carry epinephrine at all times and periodically review how and when to administer it. (See <a href=\"#H1486254\" class=\"local\">'Epinephrine for systemic symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend nonsedating second-generation H1 antihistamines for patients with cold urticaria who are unable to sufficiently avoid cold exposure and have frequent symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We typically begin with the standard dose and increase up to four times this dose, as needed, to control symptoms. Most patients respond, although some have residual symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1487514\" class=\"local\">'H1 antihistamines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptoms refractory to higher doses of H1 antihistamines, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Successful treatment with several other therapies has been described in case reports and may be used if omalizumab is not available. (See <a href=\"#H2489516523\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of refractory symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-urticaria/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Abajian M, M&#322;ynek A, Maurer M.
