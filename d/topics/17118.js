(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW DOES NEPHROTIC SYNDROME DEVELOP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrotic syndrome develops when there is damage to the glomeruli, the structures in the kidneys that work to filter the blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82497 \">figure 1</a>). This damage allows proteins in the blood (such as albumin) to leak into the urine, causing increased excretion of protein (proteinuria) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-in-the-urine-proteinuria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Protein in the urine (proteinuria) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Eventually, blood levels of albumin become reduced. Accompanying abnormalities of kidney function lead to accumulation of fluid in the tissues (edema).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">How are glomeruli damaged?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different disorders can cause damage to the glomeruli, resulting in nephrotic syndrome. In some cases, damage is confined to the kidneys alone. In other cases, organs other than the kidney are also affected (such as in diabetes mellitus or systemic lupus erythematosus):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, the most common cause of glomerular damage is a condition known as minimal change disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, approximately 30 percent of people with nephrotic syndrome have an underlying medical problem, such as diabetes or lupus; the remaining cases are due to kidney disorders such as minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), or membranous nephropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimal change disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimal change disease is a kidney disease that can occur in both adults and children. People with minimal change disease have normal or very mild abnormalities of the glomeruli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of minimal change disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. FSGS causes collapse and scarring of some glomeruli. The cause of primary FSGS is unknown, although some cases (usually in children or young adults) are the result of a genetic defect, an infection, or a toxic response to a drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Membranous nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Membranous nephropathy is a condition in which the walls of the glomerular blood vessels become thickened from the accumulation of protein deposits, causing increased &quot;leakiness.&quot; It is not clear why membranous nephropathy develops in most people, but an &quot;auto-immune&quot; mechanism is suspected (&quot;auto-immune&quot; = reaction to oneself). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney disease is common in people with diabetes who have chronically elevated blood glucose levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high blood pressure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Overview (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Some patients with more advanced disease can develop the nephrotic syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Lupus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lupus is a disease that can affect multiple organs of the body, including the kidney. Nephrotic syndrome is common in people with severe lupus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">NEPHROTIC SYNDROME SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of nephrotic syndrome are swelling, weight gain, fatigue, blood clots, and infections. Kidney failure may develop in some people. Increased excretion of protein may lead to &quot;frothy&quot; appearing urine in the toilet bowl.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Swelling (edema)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swelling that occurs in people with nephrotic syndrome commonly affects the lining of the eye socket, which often causes swelling around the eyes upon waking in the morning. Swelling (edema) can also occur in the feet or ankles after sitting or standing for any period of time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight gain can occur in people who develop swelling. Weight gain can occur rapidly.</p><p>Uncommonly, weight loss can occur in people who are losing large quantities of protein in the urine. This may be due to malnutrition or an underlying condition, such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, a chronic viral infection, or cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with nephrotic syndrome have a gradual decline in kidney function, which causes no symptoms in the early stages. However, as kidney function continues to worsen, symptoms of kidney failure can develop, including shortness of breath, weakness and easy fatigability (from anemia) and loss of appetite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26304697\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concentration of lipids (cholesterol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> triglycerides) can become greatly elevated in nephrotic syndrome. If persistent, this may increase the risk of coronary artery disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood clots</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with nephrotic syndrome are at an increased risk of blood clots in the veins or arteries. Clots in the veins can travel to the lungs. This can be dangerous, or even fatal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal vein thrombosis and hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with severe nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk for infections (particularly children with minimal change disease), although the reasons for this are not well understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">NEPHROTIC SYNDROME DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed based upon a number of laboratory tests, including urine and blood tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-kidney-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Renal (kidney) biopsy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urine tests are often done to determine the amount of protein in the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of blood tests may be recommended to help determine the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome to assess the risk of complications and to evaluate overall kidney function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal (kidney) biopsy is the standard procedure for determining the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome when a cause cannot be identified by noninvasive laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-kidney-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Renal (kidney) biopsy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">NEPHROTIC SYNDROME TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat the underlying disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first line of treatment in nephrotic syndrome is to treat the underlying cause, if the cause is found. In addition, almost all patients are given an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), which lower blood pressure, prevent worsening of kidney disease, and reduce the amount of protein excreted in the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for diabetic kidney disease is not well understood, although the best approach likely includes intensive management of blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Lupus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with lupus who have nephrotic syndrome or evidence of worsening kidney function can be treated with steroids and other medications that suppress the immune system. Most people respond well to such a regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimal change disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with minimal change disease almost always respond initially to treatment with glucocorticoids (steroids). However, relapses are common, and additional treatments are often required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minimal change disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids (steroids) is often recommended for people with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Secondary FSGS is treated primarily with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Treat the underlying disease'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Membranous nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best treatment for membranous nephropathy is a source of debate. In many people, a period of &quot;watch and wait&quot; is recommended initially to determine if the condition is worsening or causing complications. During this time, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended and it is important to keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels controlled. Additional treatment, including medications that suppress the immune system, may be needed if membranous nephropathy progresses.</p><p>Without immunosuppressive treatment, approximately 10 to 30 percent of people with membranous nephropathy have a complete resolution of symptoms over several years; a further 10 to 30 percent of people have a partial remission; approximately 40 percent of people slowly lose renal function. As a result, most people with mild symptoms are advised to delay immunosuppressive treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">until/unless</span> symptoms worsen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Treating the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to treating the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome, the signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome can sometimes be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ACE inhibitor or ARB is often recommended to reduce the loss of protein in the urine (proteinuria). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swelling in the lower legs (edema) and collection of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) can occur in people with nephrotic syndrome. Edema and ascites often improve in people who follow a low-sodium diet and take a &quot;water pill&quot; (diuretic). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of edema in patients with the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">High cholesterol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High cholesterol levels are often seen in people with nephrotic syndrome. If nephrotic syndrome persists, treatment is needed to lower blood cholesterol. Most people are initially treated with a cholesterol-lowering medication called a statin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood clots</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a blood clot forms in a blood vessel, treatment may include a blood thinner, such as warfarin (Coumadin), for as long as the nephrotic syndrome persists.
