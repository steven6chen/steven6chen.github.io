The first time you use your inhaler, you need to get it ready. This is called &quot;priming.&quot; To do this, you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the cap off the mouthpiece</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake the inhaler for 5 seconds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press down on the canister to spray the medicine into the air (away from your face)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat these steps 3 more times</p><p/><p>If you haven't used your inhaler for more than 2 weeks, you should do the steps above before you use it.</p><p>After your inhaler is ready, you can use it as prescribed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17353403\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use my inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each inhaler comes with its own directions. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use yours. In general, to use a metered dose inhaler, you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the cap off the mouthpiece.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake the inhaler for 5 seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the inhaler upright with your finger on the top of the canister and your thumb holding the bottom of the inhaler.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe out a normal breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close your lips around the mouthpiece, or hold the mouthpiece 1 to 2 inches (4 cm) in front of your mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As you start to inhale the next breath, press down on the canister.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep inhaling deeply and slowly through your mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When your lungs are full, hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds to keep the medicine in your lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let your breath out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are supposed to take 2 puffs of your inhaler, wait 15 to 30 seconds before you take the second puff. Shake the inhaler again before the second puff.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put the cap back on the mouthpiece.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you use a &quot;glucocorticoid&quot; (steroid) inhaler, rinse your mouth out with water, gargle, and spit out the water.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17353410\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have trouble pressing on the canister and breathing in?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have trouble pressing down on the canister and breathing in at the same time, let your doctor or nurse know. He or she can prescribe a:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spacer &ndash; A spacer is a device that attaches to the inhaler's mouthpiece (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56533 \">picture 2</a>). When a person presses down on the canister, the medicine sprays into the spacer and sits there until he or she breathes it in.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different type of inhaler &ndash; Dry powder inhalers work in a different way. They deliver the medicine when a person takes a deep breath from the inhaler, instead of when he or she presses down on the canister.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17353417\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use an inhaler with a spacer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To use an inhaler with a spacer, follow the directions above to get the inhaler ready.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put the inhaler into the spacer and shake for 5 seconds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe out a normal breath</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close your lips around the spacer's mouthpiece</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press down on the canister</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe in deeply and slowly, and hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds. Breathe out away from the spacer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are supposed to take 2 puffs of your inhaler, wait 15 to 30 seconds before you take the second puff. Shake the inhaler again before the second puff.</p><p/><p>Some spacers let you know if you breathe in too fast by making a whistle noise. If you hear a whistle noise when you breathe in, make sure to breathe in more slowly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17353424\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to clean my inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you use your inhaler every day, clean it at least once a week. If you don't use your inhaler every day, you can clean it less often. To know when you need to clean it, look inside the mouthpiece. Clean your inhaler when you see powder in or around the hole.</p><p>To clean an inhaler, you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the canister and cap from the mouthpiece. Do not wash the metal canister or put the canister under water.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Run warm water through the mouthpiece for 30 to 60 seconds.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake the water off of the mouthpiece and let it air-dry overnight.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put the canister back in the mouthpiece and replace the cover.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17353431\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to clean my spacer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you use an AeroChamber spacer every day, clean it every 1 to 2 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56533 \">picture 2</a>). Wash it with warm water and dishwashing soap, rinse it, and let it air-dry. Do not put it in the dishwasher.</p><p>If you use an InspirEase chamber every day, replace the bag every 1 to 2 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56533 \">picture 2</a>). Clean the mouthpiece in warm water, rinse it, and let it air-dry. Do not wash the bag.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17353438\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my inhaler is empty?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some inhalers come with a built-in dose counter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69302\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69302 \">picture 3</a>). A counter keeps track of how many doses are left in your inhaler.</p><p>When the counter reads 0 (zero), it's time to throw out the inhaler because it has no more medicine in it. Make sure to have another inhaler on hand before the counter reads 0.</p><p>If your inhaler doesn't have a built-in counter, you need to keep track of the number of doses left in your inhaler. Based on how often you use your inhaler, you can figure out when you will need a refill and write this date down.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17353445\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-soft-mist-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your soft mist inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-corticosteroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Inhaled corticosteroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
