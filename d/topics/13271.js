Twenty-five years later, Ludwig Merzbacher further described the neuropathology of 12 affected individuals related to the proband [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Together, Pelizaeus and Merzbacher identified the X-linked inheritance, the neonatal features, and the hypomyelination of the central nervous system that characterize the disease.</p><p>Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD; MIM 312080) is classified as a dysmyelinating or hypomyelinating disorder, in which normal myelination never occurs, as opposed to a demyelinating disorder, in which normal myelin is later destroyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>It is now recognized that PMD and subtype called X-linked spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2; MIM 312920) are caused by mutations of the gene for proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1; MIM 300401) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of PMD and related disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations of the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene result in a range of phenotypes that form a clinical spectrum, from the more severe PMD at one end, to the relatively mild X-linked spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) at the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Over 160 mutations of the PLP1 gene, which is located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq22.2), have been identified in PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of PLP1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PLP1 gene encodes both proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin DM20 proteolipid protein (DM20), major structural myelin proteins that contribute to the integrity of myelinated axons. Protein DM20 is a spliced isoform of PLP1 that is expressed earlier than PLP during development, although it is not as abundant as PLP in the mature central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Mature oligodendrocytes develop and initiate protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. DM20 may be responsible for oligodendrocyte differentiation and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], whereas PLP is involved in membrane signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In addition, PLP is required for the production and stabilization of compact myelin, likely due to its role in forming integrin receptor adhesion complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. Interruption of the intracellular trafficking and secretory pathways in PMD results in cell death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Duplications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common mutation is the duplication of the PLP1 gene, which accounts for approximately 60 to 70 percent of PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15,16</a>]. Duplication is caused by unequal sister chromatid exchange in male meiosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>Duplications of the PLP1 gene most likely cause overexpression of PLP, which results in protein accumulation in the late endosomes and lysosomes. After synthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of oligodendrocytes, PLP interacts with cholesterol and galactocerebroside in the Golgi to form myelin &quot;rafts.&quot; The overexpression of PLP overwhelms this process, altering the composition of the rafts, and compromising the structure of the myelin sheath. Lipid rafts are unique structures within the plasma membrane composed primarily of cholesterol, sphingolipids, and scaffolding proteins that are important for vesicular trafficking, signaling mechanisms, and molecular transport. Disruption of these functions results in impaired lipid-lipid, lipid-protein, and membrane-cytoskeletal interactions which have been implicated in many neurologic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The size of the PLP1 duplication is variable and does not correlate with outcome. However, overexpression of PLP, or the amount of excess protein produced, is associated with the severity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. Most patients with duplications of the PLP1 gene have classic PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Missense mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein misfolding caused by PLP1 mutations is another likely pathogenic mechanism of PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In oligodendrocytes, PLP1 is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and modified in the Golgi complex prior to transport to the myelin membrane.</p><p>Thus, the accumulation of misfolded PLP and DM20 in the ER leads to the expression of disease in PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>When both PLP and DM20 are not folded properly prior to transport, the misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, resulting in upregulation of genes that induce apoptosis and a more severe disease phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, when only PLP is misfolded, PLP is retained in the ER, but the oligodendrocyte survives, producing a less severe phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>In general, the most severe phenotypes are caused by missense mutations, especially amino acid substitutions in highly conserved regions of the protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Missense mutations impair PLP protein cellular transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum in oligodendrocytes, which ultimately causes cell death as described above. In the connatal phenotype, a missense mutation inhibits both PLP and DM20 transport, whereas only PLP transport is affected in missense mutations that cause classic PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>Thus, the accumulation of misfolded PLP and DM20 in the ER leads to the expression of disease in PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Other mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative amino acid substitutions in less-critical regions of the protein cause a similar, less severe phenotype. Nonsense mutations, splice-site mutations, and small deletions have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Null mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deletion of the PLP1 gene or disrupted translation due to a point mutation at the beginning of the coding region results in a loss of function in which no protein is produced. These null-mutations cause relatively mild disease, such as mild spastic paraparesis and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Patients without PLP and DM20 are still able to form myelin; however, compact sheaths and axonal interactions are defective due to a loss of the structural proteins. The resulting phenotype is less severe than those associated with other mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the estimated prevalence of PMD is between 1:200,000 and 1:500,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A retrospective review of 122 children with an inherited leukodystrophy from a regional center in Utah reported that PMD was the etiology in 7.4 percent, making PMD the second most common diagnosis, behind only metachromatic leukodystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In Japan, the incidence of PMD due to a proteolipid protein 1 mutation was estimated to be 1.45 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major features of PMD are nystagmus, spasticity, athetosis, tremor, and ataxia. The symptoms vary in onset and severity, thereby producing a clinical spectrum of disease.</p><p>Various forms or phenotypes of PMD are distinguished by the severity of disease and other clinical features. These are connatal, classic, and transitional PMD; X-linked spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2); and proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) null syndrome. These phenotypes of PMD do not necessarily represent distinct clinical syndromes, as overlap exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/4,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24,25</a>].</p><p>While PMD is an X-linked disease, female carriers may develop mild to moderate neurologic manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Carrier females'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Connatal PMD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most severe form, connatal PMD, presents at birth or during the first weeks of life with pendular nystagmus, hypotonia, respiratory distress, pharyngeal weakness, and stridor. Affected males later develop significant spasticity and have little voluntary muscle control. They have significant head lag and cannot sit unsupported or ambulate. The motor difficulties extend to their expressive language, which usually does not develop, but they may develop receptive language. Cognitive impairment is likely. Pharyngeal weakness causes swallowing difficulties, and infants can have stridor, optic atrophy, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>].</p><p>Most children with connatal PMD die before the age of 10 because of aspiration, but survival until the second or third decade has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic PMD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic PMD, the most common form of the disease, also presents in infancy, usually within the first two to four months of life. Affected males develop nystagmus, hypotonia with lower extremity weakness, trunk and limb ataxia, and head titubation. The motor milestones are delayed, and children develop spastic quadriparesis. Most children never walk independently. Language function can be normal, although dysarthria and cognitive impairments are common. The affected patients do not have any respiratory involvement and can survive at least until the sixth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Transitional form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transitional form between the connatal and classic forms has been proposed for patients with overlapping features involving the onset and severity of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>]. However, with variation in phenotypes and the age proximity between the connatal and classic forms, the utility of this subtype has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/4,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">X-linked spastic paraplegia type 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A milder form of PMD known as X-linked spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) presents in the first five years of life. Despite a delay in gross motor skills, many children learn to walk independently, although they may become nonambulatory as they develop mild to severe spasticity.</p><p>Patients with SPG2 can be further subdivided into complicated spastic paraplegia and pure spastic paraplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complicated spastic paraplegia is similar to the other types of PMD in which patients have limb and truncal ataxia and nystagmus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pure spastic paraplegia has no other signs of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, aside from the spastic paraparesis</p><p/><p>With both forms, autonomic dysfunction, such as bladder spasticity, may develop. Patients can have normal language, intelligence, and life expectancy. In addition, males with SPG2 can reproduce, in contrast to all other forms of PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">PLP1 null syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subset of patients with null mutations presents in the first five years of life with mild spastic quadriparesis, mostly affecting the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Null mutations'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with the null syndrome are able to ambulate despite the increased tone. They have ataxia but not nystagmus. While they have mild to moderate cognitive difficulties, language skills develop initially. The PLP1 null syndrome is further distinguished from other forms of PMD by the presence of a mild multifocal demyelinating peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Carrier females</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although PMD is an X-linked disorder, women who are heterozygous carriers may be symptomatic. In fact, there is a paradoxical relationship between the disease severity in men and affected women, which is that women from families with mildly affected males are more likely to have neurologic symptoms than women with severely affected relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>This paradox is explained by the random inactivation of the X-chromosome that results in an average 50 percent expression of the abnormal protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In heterozygous females, the oligodendrocytes that express the severe mutation undergo apoptosis. In time, the normal oligodendrocytes (those that express the other X chromosome) produce a sufficient amount of PLP protein to compensate for the loss. However, in heterozygous women who have the less severe mutations, apoptosis of the abnormal oligodendrocytes does not take place, and those women end up with abnormal myelin, resulting in neurologic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/6,9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,28</a>]. There is a single case report of a woman presenting in infancy with a &quot;classic&quot; male phenotype characterized by nystagmus, spasticity, and significant motor delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Genetic testing revealed a deletion of exons 1 to 7 of the PLP1 gene and nonrandom skewed X-chromosome inactivation, suggesting preferential activation of the X chromosome with the deletion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An appreciation of the normal appearance of unmyelinated and myelinated white matter structures on brain MRI is helpful for understanding imaging studies of infants and children with a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unmyelinated white matter has a high signal intensity on T2-weighted and low signal on T1-weighted images</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myelinated white matter has a low signal intensity on T2-weighted and a high signal intensity on T1-weighted images</p><p/><p>In normal development, the bulk of CNS myelination occurs during the first two years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,30</a>]. Thus, in infants younger than two years with a dysmyelination syndrome, the brain MRI may not show obvious white matter abnormalities.</p><p>In normal full-term infants, myelination is usually evident on MRI in the pons and cerebellum, and by the age of three months, normal infants show myelination in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, splenium of the corpus callosum, and optic radiations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Absence of these MRI findings suggests the diagnosis of a dysmyelinating syndrome such as PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The brain MRI of older children with the PMD phenotype often reveals diffuse leukodystrophy with increased signal intensity in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brainstem on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51393\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51393 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>No clear correlation between genotype, clinical phenotype, and MRI phenotype has been established for PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, some experts have noted an inverse correlation between the amount of myelin present and the clinical disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As an example, no myelin is present at all in some infants with connatal PMD, the most severe form of PMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In patients with the classic PMD phenotype, the white matter abnormalities on MRI have been divided into three subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I: diffuse abnormality in the hemispheres with lesions affecting the corticospinal tracts; this type was found in patients with a PLP1 duplication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II: similar hemispheric lesions without corticospinal involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III: patchy hemispheric involvement.

However, the reported abnormalities on T2 MRI in SPG2 range from discrete or patchy hyperintensities to more diffuse leukoencephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Studies evaluating magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in patients with PMD have found no consistent pattern of abnormalities.

However, there is preliminary evidence that patients with PLP1 duplications may have a distinctive pattern of metabolite abnormalities, with a reduced choline level and increased levels of creatinine, glutamine, and inositol as well as NAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,40</a>].

The axons of the central nervous system lack the typical myelin sheath. In addition, there is a profound loss of oligodendrocytes, which produce myelin. Although not as remarkable, axonal damage has been demonstrated, likely due to impaired axonal transport from altered proteolipid protein-mediated oligodendrocyte-axonal interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/6,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Duplication of the PLP1 gene is the most common defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], accounting for 50 to 60 percent of identified mutations; deletions of the PLP1 gene account for &le;2 percent of PMD cases. Therefore, the recommended initial genetic screening test is a search for duplications or deletions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Fortunately, the microarrays that have replaced karyotypes and chromosome analyses as the first-round diagnostic test for children with developmental disabilities cover the PLP1 locus. Both oligonucleotide and SNP-based arrays detect PLP1 whole-gene duplications or deletions; however, the detection of only one or a few exon deletions or duplications is dependent on the specific array. In patients suspected of PMD who have a normal microarray analysis, targeted PLP1 gene testing is recommended. Targeted testing specifically for PLP1 gene <span class=\"nowrap\">duplication/deletion</span> is typically done by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis or real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] testing is less commonly used, given the advantages and increased sensitivity of the newer genetic diagnostic techniques described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Rarely, there can be a balanced translocation involving the PLP1 gene that cannot be detected by array comparative genomic hybridization methods and requires karyotypic analysis. Complex duplication-inverted triplication-duplication <span class=\"nowrap\">(DUP-TRP/INV-DUP)</span> rearrangements of the PLP1 gene have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>A search for intragenic PLP1 mutations by direct gene sequencing should be attempted if <span class=\"nowrap\">duplication/deletion</span> testing is unrevealing. Direct sequencing of the gene will detect the PLP1 sequence variants found in 15 to 25 percent of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nevertheless rare mutations lie in the regulatory regions or deep in introns; these are not routinely analyzed by gene sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Mutation analysis of the GJC2 (formerly GJA12) gene should be considered if inheritance is autosomal recessive, the proband is female, or all the mutational mechanisms in PLP1 gene have been excluded. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Prenatal testing, using amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, has been used to detect mutations of PLP1 in at-risk fetuses. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis following in-vitro fertilization may be an option for some couples.
