Patients with an alcohol intake of 30 or more grams per day (one standard drink contains 14 grams of alcohol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56818\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56818 \">figure 1</a>)) are at increased risk of cirrhosis, although the majority of patients will not develop cirrhosis despite heavy alcohol intake (point prevalence of 1 percent for those who drink 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and 6 percent for those who drink 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Unfortunately, among those who do develop liver disease, symptoms often develop only after severe, life-threatening liver disease has already developed.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis. The management of alcoholic liver disease, the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease, and the approach to patients with alcoholic hepatitis are discussed separately.

It was estimated that in 2010, alcohol-attributable cirrhosis was responsible for 493,300 deaths (1 percent of all deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the United States, the National Institutes of Health estimated that in 2009, there were more than 31,000 deaths from cirrhosis and that alcohol played a role in 48 percent of those deaths (age-adjusted death rate of 4.5 deaths per 100,000 population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Areas with high rates of alcohol consumption and alcoholic liver disease include Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Alarm over the rising impact of alcoholic liver disease has provoked national response in the United Kingdom to address this crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. On the other hand, countries with large Muslim populations have the lowest rates of alcohol consumption and alcoholic liver disease. The United States is intermediate in its level of consumption (9.4 L per adult per year, compared with 13.4 L per year in the United Kingdom and 0.6 L per year in Indonesia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17187132\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol abuse may lead to steatosis, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic steatosis is seen in approximately 90 percent of heavy drinkers and is typically macrovesicular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. It may be seen within two weeks of regular alcohol ingestion and resolves rapidly with abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a study of four patients with normal baseline liver biopsies, ingestion of 98 to 138 grams of alcohol per day resulted in moderate to marked steatosis in all four after 16 to 18 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It has been estimated that a third of patients with steatosis will develop hepatic inflammation (steatohepatitis) if they continue to drink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alcoholic liver disease is increasing in many parts of Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Once steatohepatitis has developed, the risk of cirrhosis is increased compared with simple steatosis. In one study, over a five-year period, cirrhosis developed in 16 percent of patients with steatohepatitis and in 7 percent of patients with simple steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Higher rates of progression to cirrhosis are seen among patients with steatohepatitis who continue to drink or who present with symptomatic alcoholic hepatitis (up to 50 percent for both groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Overall, it is estimated that 8 to 20 percent of patients with steatosis will eventually progress to cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Hepatic decompensation is common among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. In a population-based study from Denmark that included 446 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, the risk of complications (ascites development, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy) was approximately 25 percent after one year and 50 percent after five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Once hepatic decompensation develops, the expected five-year transplant-free survival rate is 60 percent for those who stop drinking alcohol and 30 percent for those who continue to drink alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/18,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1680453\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of alcoholic liver disease depend on the severity of disease.

The classic finding is moderately elevated transaminases, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio &gt;1 (and often &gt;2).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62649244\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver test abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum aminotransferase levels may be normal or moderately elevated in the setting of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The AST elevation is usually less than eight times the upper limit of normal, and the ALT elevation is typically less than five times the upper limit of normal. The degree of elevation does not correlate with the severity of the underlying liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Unlike other forms of liver disease in which the serum ALT level often is higher than the serum AST level, the most common pattern of liver biochemical test abnormalities in alcoholic liver disease is a disproportionate elevation of the AST compared with the ALT, resulting in a ratio greater than one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. As an example, in a study that included 38 patients with alcoholic liver disease, the mean AST was 92 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> and the ALT was 80 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> (AST to ALT ratio of 1.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The relatively lower elevation of serum ALT has been ascribed in part to hepatic deficiency of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in alcoholics, which is a cofactor for the enzymatic activity of ALT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. According to this hypothesis, the altered ratio reflects a failure to appropriately increase the ALT, rather than a disproportionate elevation in AST.</p><p>An AST to ALT ratio &gt;1 is occasionally seen in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and is frequently seen in patients who have developed nonalcoholic cirrhosis. However, if the ratio is greater than two, the transaminase elevations are likely due to alcoholic liver disease since values greater than two are rarely seen in other forms of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In a study of 271 patients with biopsy-confirmed liver disorders, more than 90 percent of the patients whose AST to ALT ratio was &ge;2 had alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The percentage increased to greater than 96 percent when the ratio was &ge;3.

In a study that included 123 patients who abused alcohol, all of the patients with liver disease had elevations of the GGT approximately 8 to 10 times the upper limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The GGT elevations persisted after eight weeks of abstinence. However, GGT elevations are not specific for alcoholic liver disease. For example, elevated GGT levels may be seen in patients with biliary or pancreatic disease and in patients taking certain medications such as barbiturates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>.

Elevation of the bilirubin in a patient who does not have cirrhosis should raise concern for alcoholic hepatitis. Patients who are malnourished or who have cirrhosis may have low albumin levels.

Macrocytosis suggests longstanding disease and may result from vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, alcohol toxicity, or increased lipid deposition in red cell membranes.

This is most often seen in the pericentral region of hepatic lobules (zone 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Fat accumulation can be seen easily by light microscopy; inflammatory changes are minimal at this stage apart from occasional lipogranulomata in pericentral zones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Fat in alcoholic liver disease is typically macrovesicular and composed of neutral triglycerides. However, small droplets of triglycerides may resemble microvesicular fat (and indeed are sometimes referred to as such on pathology reports) but are not the same as the lipid droplets that form microvesicular fat in other disorders such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80340 \">picture 2</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> toxicity, and Reye's syndrome. Microvesicular fat in these conditions (which is composed of free fatty acids that are hepatotoxic) can only be detected by special stains and not on standard light microscopy.</p><p>Steatosis may progress to steatohepatitis. As with steatosis, inflammation is typically first seen in zone 3. As the disease progresses, the histologic changes may extend to the portal tracts. The findings may vary among patients with regard to their extent and severity. The presence of neutrophils is a hallmark of alcoholic steatohepatitis and is unusual in chronic viral hepatitis. Their role in pathogenesis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mallory-Denk bodies (previously called Mallory bodies or Mallory's hyaline) are eosinophilic accumulations of intracellular protein aggregates within the cytoplasm of hepatocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75188 \">picture 4B</a>). They represent condensations of intracellular &quot;intermediate filaments&quot; or cytokeratins that are normal components of the hepatocyte cytoskeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The mechanisms underlying Mallory-Denk body formation in alcoholic liver disease are unclear. Furthermore, they are not specific for alcoholic steatohepatitis and can be seen in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], Indian childhood cirrhosis (thought in part to be due to high copper intake), starvation, after jejunoileal bypass surgery for morbid obesity, or after the use of certain drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> or perhexiline).

However, their presence is an important marker of alcohol-induced injury. In a large, multicenter Veterans Administration study, Mallory-Denk bodies were detected in 76 percent of those with alcoholic hepatitis and in 95 percent of those who also had cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Alcoholic fibrosis, like the other lesions seen in alcoholic liver disease, first appears in zone 3 and may progress to become panlobular, particularly in those who continue to drink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Early zone 3 fibrosis, also called hyaline necrosis, predicts a high likelihood of eventual cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Since patients who abuse alcohol often deny having a drinking problem, the presence of zone 3 fibrosis can sometimes be used to convince a patient who drinks heavily that his or her drinking is a problem and that eventual progression to end-stage liver disease is virtually certain with continued alcohol abuse.</p><p>The term &quot;fibrosis&quot; in this setting denotes the accumulation of scar or extracellular matrix and is potentially reversible in the absence of continued alcohol abuse. By contrast, true cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82544%7EGAST%2F65537\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82544 graphicRef65537 \">picture 3A-B</a>) is characterized by the presence of regenerative nodules and is generally thought to be irreversible, even in the absence of further alcohol ingestion. Cirrhosis in alcoholic liver disease may be micronodular or macronodular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].
