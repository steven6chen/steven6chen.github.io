Not every patient benefits from renal replacement therapy to the same degree.</p><p>The universal availability of dialysis in the United States allows the nephrologist to consider its application in every patient in whom it might be indicated. In this setting, each patient and clinical setting must be judged individually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, the issues and concerns surrounding a 45-year-old patient with adult polycystic kidney disease are entirely different from those of a 90 year old with severe arteriosclerosis.</p><p>The general ethical issues surrounding the dialytic or conservative care of patients with ESRD are presented in this topic review. Issues regarding kidney transplantation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Practical considerations regarding the decision to forego dialysis and the ongoing medical care of patients who forego dialysis are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care#H22477043\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Applying principlism in palliative care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3463750861\"><span class=\"h2\">Principalism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Principalism is composed of four principles: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and distributive justice.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autonomy &ndash;</strong> Respecting autonomy means ensuring the informed patient&rsquo;s right to participate in medical decision making. Patient autonomy is central to modern American biomedical ethics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beneficence &ndash;</strong> The principle of beneficence mandates that clinicians act in the best interests of their patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonmaleficence &ndash;</strong> The principle of nonmaleficence is the instruction for doctors to first do no harm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Distributive justice &ndash;</strong> Justice requires that all people be treated well and fairly and also that health resources be used equitably.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3970843828\"><span class=\"h2\">Application of ethical principles to decisions regarding dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the focus on patient-centered care and shared decision making, the provider must find a balance to preserve patient autonomy while not sacrificing the ethical principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence. Distributive justice is an important principle to consider in scenarios in which there is not an abundance of resources or in which treatment availability is limited. For example, in an area in which there is limited availability of dialysis treatment, the clinician must address how to fairly allocate this resource among those patients who could benefit.</p><p>The following considerations should be reviewed with the patient and family or decision makers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical indications</strong> &ndash; Available treatment options should be discussed with the patient and family, with a focus on risks and benefits. The goal of the therapy should be to promote the patient&rsquo;s wellbeing (<strong>beneficence</strong>)<strong> </strong>while avoiding the imposition of greater potential harm (<strong>nonmaleficence</strong>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient preferences</strong> &ndash; Identification of a patient's wishes and overall care goals in order to develop a congruent treatment plan focuses upon upholding patient <strong>autonomy</strong>.<strong> </strong>However, the clinician must ensure that the patient fully understands realistic treatment outcomes, as well as explore the patient's overall care goals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quality of life &ndash;</strong> In order to uphold the ethical principles of <strong>nonmaleficence</strong> and <strong>beneficence</strong>, the clinician must describe the potential effects that the treatments, dialysis or conservative management, will have on quality of life, symptoms, functional status, emotional health, and cognitive function. (See <a href=\"#H3740033424\" class=\"local\">'Education and communication with the patient'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contextual features &ndash; </strong>Contextual features are nonclinical factors that may serve as potential influencers or barriers to a patient&rsquo;s decision-making ability. These may include religion, financial factors, cultural beliefs, and past experience with the medical system.</p><p/><p>Conflict can occur when a patient or decision maker is deemed to have &quot;unrealistic&quot; goals or requests interventions that a provider believes are not indicated. This conflict sets the stage for the provider to determine why the patient is requesting such treatment. It can range from a misunderstanding of what the treatment can provide to underlying goals and values that the patient may have (eg, hopes to see the birth of a grandchild). By following this approach to ethical decision making, the provider can remember that clinical indications alone are insufficient for a decision to be made.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3740033424\"><span class=\"h1\">EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE PATIENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1874572486\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of communication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inadequate knowledge about the disease state and an individual patient's rights can lead to conflicts between concerned parties. Most of these conflicts could be avoided if each patient (and family) and clinician had clear and effective avenues of communication and full understanding of the medical situation. Such an understanding could be achieved by disclosing prognosis to patients and family and establishing a proper advance directive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a duly appointed surrogate.</p><p>An appropriate discussion of the individual patient&rsquo;s prognosis and of the potential benefits and burdens of dialysis in general may lead some patients to forego such treatment.</p><p>In order to simultaneously uphold patient autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence, it is important that the patient&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding of renal and medical disorders be explored and addressed. This discussion should address prognosis and quality of life with and without dialysis.</p><p>Among patients who are near end of life, the nephrology care team can be a major force in a &quot;peaceful death&quot; by opening lines of communication and encouraging advance care planning (ACP). The recognition of the patient's fears and concerns will stimulate open discussion, make it less difficult to converse about the end of life, and may ultimately lead to decisions about when to forego dialysis. Data from cancer patients suggest that conversations about end-of-life preferences may improve the quality of dying and enhance caregiver wellbeing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Discussions surrounding life-sustaining measures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and mechanical ventilation, as well as end of life, occur infrequently in the dialysis population. One study showed that only 30 percent of patients reported discussing CPR or mechanical ventilation with their nephrologist, 10 percent discussed end of life, and 10 percent discussed palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Though patients rated the general communication skills of their nephrologist as high, ratings regarding communication surrounding end-of-life care were very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Though the majority of patients reported that they were &quot;not ready&quot; to talk about what care they would want if they got very sick, the majority of patients had clear preferences on CPR and preference for site of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This highlights the important role that the provider has in initiating these conversations.</p><p>Barriers exist for providers to initiate conversations to disclose prognosis, discuss future or end-of-life care, or give &quot;bad news.&quot; A deficiency in education regarding communication during training has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some providers may consider it a failure to discuss death as an outcome if they have the perception that they have been trained to cure disease and save lives. In an effort to shield patients from distressing information, providers may not communicate all aspects of an illness, leading to a gap in patient understanding and expectations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2522500857\"><span class=\"h2\">How to communicate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several well-accepted protocols for communicating the prospects of a bad outcome to knowledgeable patients. Such an encounter has two distinct components: imparting information to the patient and participating in a therapeutic dialogue in which the clinician listens to, hears, and responds to the patient's reaction to &rdquo;bad news.&quot; The interview can be broken down into different segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>SPIRES (<strong>s</strong>etup, <strong>p</strong>erceptions and perspectives, <strong>i</strong>nvitation, <strong>r</strong>ecommendation, <strong>e</strong>mpathize, <strong>s</strong>ummarize and strategize) is a communication framework that has been described in dialysis decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Setup &ndash;</strong> Setup involves reviewing pertinent medical information about the patient, discussing the case with other involved medical providers, and determining an estimation of prognosis with available treatment options. The provider can assess if the patient is ready to discuss the aforementioned treatment (&quot;I think it is important to think about what you want if your kidney disease got worse and what next steps could be. Is it okay if we discuss this today?&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perceptions</strong> &ndash; Patient <strong>perceptions</strong> regarding their kidney disease and potential treatments are elicited. This can be achieved by asking questions such as: &quot;I know you have seen many doctors in the past; can you share with me what you have heard about your kidney disease?&quot; or &quot;What are some outcomes you hope to obtain by treating your kidney disease?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During this step, the provider should also explore patient <strong>preferences</strong>, including big-picture goals and overall values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The clinician may also ask &quot;What makes your life worth living?&rdquo; or &quot;What worries you most about the future?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Invitation &ndash;</strong> After gaining a sense of understanding and identifying the patient&rsquo;s overall goals and values, the provider can ask for an <strong>invitation </strong>to either clarify information or make a recommendation. For example, it may be helpful to ask: &quot;I understand that is most important to you. Would you like to hear what treatment I think would fit best with your overall goals?&rdquo; or &quot;Would it be helpful to hear how people like you do on dialysis?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recommendation &ndash;</strong> After the patient accepts the invitation, the provider can then make a <strong>recommendation</strong> regarding treatment. It is during this step that prognosis can also be shared.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Empathize &ndash;</strong> It is very likely that a patient or family will have an emotional response to the information being discussed. It is essential to<strong> empathize</strong> or respond to these emotions. Ignoring the emotions limits the ability of the patient or family to understand what the provider is saying or make decisions moving forward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Summarize and strategize &ndash;</strong> At the end of the patient encounter, the providers should <strong>summarize</strong> and assess what the patient understood from the discussion. An example is asking the patient: &quot;What will you tell your (fill in name of friend or relative) about what we discussed today?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is also important to establish a plan of care or<strong> strategy</strong> for the future. The patient should be offered continued support by the provider. Patients like to hear that there is a future and open line of communication.</p><p/><p>If the individual is mentally competent, the clinician's primary responsibility is to the <strong>patient</strong>. The family's opinions and feelings are important, but they should never supplant the patient's desires. It is therefore important for the clinician to realize the family can have desires that are identical to, totally different from, or the same but with a different timeframe (asynchronous) as that of the patient.</p><p>If the individual <strong>is not</strong> mentally competent and is unlikely to regain such function, the nephrologist should adhere to a previously completed healthcare proxy (HCP) or advance directive.

This discussion should take place at the same time when options for renal replacement therapies versus conservative care takes place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Preparation for and initiation of renal replacement therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Mortality and outcomes of older ESRD patients who are on dialysis and who are being treated conservatively are discussed elsewhere.

Patients overestimated prognosis in 64 percent of cases. Eighty-one percent of patients thought that they had at least a 90 percent chance of survival at one year, whereas nephrologists thought that this was true in only 25 percent of patients. Only 6 percent of patients thought that they had less than a 50 percent chance of being alive in five years, whereas nephrologists estimated that this was true in more than half of patients. Of the patients with optimistic views of prognosis, 44 percent preferred life-extending treatment, whereas 54 percent of all patients said that, if they were seriously ill, they would prefer care focused on improving quality of life over quantity. Despite this, 60 percent of nephrologists would refuse to provide an estimate of prognosis to a patient, even if the patient insisted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2805496673\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older patients with advanced or multiple comorbidities who are initiated on dialysis require more medical interventions (such as intubation, feeding tube placement) and are more commonly hospitalized compared with those treated conservatively. In a cohort of older patients, those who elected dialysis spent approximately half of their days survived (173 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/patient/year)</span> either receiving dialysis or in the hospital compared with less than 5 percent in those conservatively managed (16 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/patient/year)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Patients on dialysis experience symptom burdens similar to those with cancer; such symptoms are often under-recognized and undertreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Poorly treated symptoms can negatively impact patient experience and quality of life. In one prospective study of dialysis and conservatively managed patients, quality-of-life scores were similar between the two groups; however, patients who elected dialysis scored lower on measures of satisfaction with life. Almost half of these patients experienced a reduction in satisfaction with life scores after dialysis initiation, with scores remaining stable without improvement over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

This is ideally done after an exploration of the patient and caregiver&rsquo;s knowledge, fears, hopes, and needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. ACP can include completion of an advance directive if patients wish to document their wishes for medical care and surrogate decision maker. Advance directives include living wills, healthcare proxies (HCPs) or surrogates, and medical or physician orders for life-sustaining treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">(M/POLST)</span>.

It can only be completed by the patient at a time when he or she has capacity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An HCP is appointed by the patient, at a time of capacity, to act on <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> behalf should <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> become incompetent. The proxy must be over 18 years of age, should be aware of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> appointment, and should know the patient&rsquo;s wishes and desires. The HCP can be changed at any time by the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A healthcare surrogate is appointed by medical providers at a time when the patient does not have capacity and an HCP had not been previously established.

Unlike a &quot;living will,&quot; this can be completed by the patient, HCP, or surrogate. It includes decisions around several aspects of care including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hospitalizations, medical interventions (full aggressive care, time-limited trial or comfort care), use of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, nutrition, and dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">M/POLST</span> documents also differ from living wills and HCP or surrogate documents in that they are actual orders signed by a physician. Thus, in states adopting <span class=\"nowrap\">M/POLST</span> orders, medical care is predetermined by signed orders, not simply suggested by previously expressed patient wishes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefits of advance care planning in dialysis patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACP helps to ensure that patients receive care that is consistent with their wishes. In addition, it aims to provide guidance to the family and reduce their decisional burden about whether they are following these wishes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. ACP can lay the groundwork by providing a framework that surrogates may utilize to inform decision making, keeping in mind the patient&rsquo;s goals, values, and beliefs, as well as the patient's treatment preferences. Some have also suggested that ACP reduces moral distress among healthcare providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>There are data suggesting that advance directives in patients with ESRD may contribute to &quot;peaceful deaths&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

The patient should also identify the surrogate in an HCP who can help the patient make decisions or make decisions in the patient&rsquo;s behalf, if necessary. Significant system-level barriers exist and serve to complicate the promotion of ACP among dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These include the complex, fragmented medical care delivered to this population across providers and settings over time, the lack of a shared vision and understanding of ACP, lack of defined responsibility for ACP, and a lack of communication and collaboration among providers of care to dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Efforts to promote system-wide collaboration in this aspect of care for dialysis patients are needed.</p><p>The existence of a healthcare surrogate or proxy is especially important among patients who lack decision-making capacity in whom withdrawal of dialysis is being considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,36-40</a>].</p><p>Advance directives concerning the patient's desires about dialysis are also important among patients with a short life expectancy (expected death within 60 days) due to a terminal illness that cannot be reversed by dialysis and in patients with end-stage lung, liver, or heart disease who are confined to bed or chair and need assistance with activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39</a>]. The decision to withhold dialysis from these patients needs to be made on an individual basis since dialysis may give some patients the time for the resolution of personal and social issues prior to their expected death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decisions involving the initiation or maintenance of dialysis, particularly among patients who are suboptimal candidates for chronic dialysis therapy, involve several ethical principles, collectively called principalism. These principles include <strong>autonomy</strong>, <strong>beneficence</strong>, <strong>nonmaleficence</strong>, and <strong>distributive justice</strong>. (See <a href=\"#H2233804\" class=\"local\">'Ethical framework in decision making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following considerations should be reviewed with the patient and family or decision makers:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Medical indications</strong> &ndash; Available treatment options should be discussed with the patient and family, with a focus on risks and benefits. The goal of the therapy should be to promote the patient&rsquo;s wellbeing (<strong>beneficence</strong>)<strong> </strong>while avoiding the imposition of greater potential harm (<strong>nonmaleficence</strong>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Patient preferences</strong> &ndash; Identification of a patient&rsquo;s wishes and overall care goals in order to develop a congruent treatment plan focuses upon upholding patient <strong>autonomy</strong>.<strong> </strong>However, the clinician must ensure that the patient fully understands realistic treatment outcomes, as well as exploring their overall care goals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Quality of life &ndash;</strong> In order to uphold the ethical principles of <strong>nonmaleficence</strong> and <strong>beneficence</strong>, the clinician must describe the potential effects that the treatments, dialysis or conservative management, will have on quality of life, symptoms, functional status, emotional health, and cognitive function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Contextual features &ndash; </strong>Contextual features are nonclinical factors that may serve as potential influencers or barriers to a patient&rsquo;s decision-making ability. These may include religion, financial factors, cultural beliefs, and past experience with the medical system. (See <a href=\"#H3740033424\" class=\"local\">'Education and communication with the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A well-informed discussion of individual prognosis both with and without dialysis is required before a patient (or healthcare proxy [HCP]) can make a rational decision regarding dialysis. This discussion should take place at the same time when options for renal replacement therapies versus conservative care take place. (See <a href=\"#H252558351\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several well-accepted protocols for communicating the prospects of a bad outcome to knowledgeable patients. Such an encounter has two distinct components: imparting information to the patient and participating in a therapeutic dialogue in which the clinician listens to, hears, and responds to the patient's reaction to the &quot;bad news.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H2522500857\" class=\"local\">'How to communicate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance directives include living wills, HCPs or surrogates, and medical or physician orders for life-sustaining treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">(M/POLST)</span>. Advance directives may contribute to &quot;good deaths&quot; in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Such patients frequently welcome discussions about advance directives when clinicians introduce the subject.
