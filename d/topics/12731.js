During the past decade, aromatase inhibitors have been explored as an option for ovulation induction in women who fail to conceive with clomiphene citrate. Aromatase inhibitors are a class of drugs that block estrogen biosynthesis, thereby reducing negative estrogenic feedback at the pituitary.</p><p>This topic reviews the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, the most effective aromatase inhibitor, for ovulation induction in women with PCOS and as an adjunct to gonadotropin therapy for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in women with ovulatory infertility. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> and gonadotropins is reviewed separately.

It is a good target for selective inhibition because estrogen production is a terminal step in the biosynthetic sequence. Aromatase activity is present in many tissues, including the ovaries, brain, adipose tissue, muscle, liver, and breast.</p><p>Aromatase inhibitors are widely used as adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with breast cancer. They have been used off-label in the treatment of patients with anovulatory infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and for increasing the number of ovarian follicles recruited in ovulatory women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

In postmenopausal women, at doses of 1 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> these drugs inhibit estrogen biosynthesis by 97 to &gt;99 percent, resulting in estrogen concentrations below the level detected by most sensitive immunoassays. They are completely absorbed after oral administration and have a mean terminal half-life of approximately 45 hours (range, 30 to 60 hours); clearance is mainly hepatic. By comparison, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exemestane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exemestane</a>, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, has a circulating half-life of approximately nine hours, but the inhibitory effect is potentially much longer because its effect on aromatase is irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Administration of an aromatase inhibitor to premenopausal women on days 3 to 7 of the menstrual cycle results in suppression of ovarian estradiol secretion, a rise in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (due to release from the negative feedback effect of estradiol), follicular development, and estradiol production (as the effect of the aromatase inhibitor diminishes). As the dominant follicle grows and estrogen levels rise, normal negative feedback occurs centrally because aromatase inhibitors do not deplete estrogen receptors (ER) in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. FSH is then suppressed and the smaller-growing follicles become atretic, resulting in monofollicular ovulation in most cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81745\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81745 \">figure 1</a>). The potential for monoovulation represents a theoretical advantage over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate, which is associated with an increased risk of multiple gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate&quot;, section on 'Outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>The addition of FSH to an aromatase inhibitor is necessary to achieve multiple ovulation, the desired goal in the setting of COH or in vitro fertilization (IVF). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted, aromatase inhibitors (most commonly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>) have been used off-label in the treatment of patients with anovulatory infertility, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>], and for increasing the number of ovarian follicles in ovulatory women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Letrozole is unlikely to be successful in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea or ovarian failure as they are already hypoestrogenemic at baseline. Alternative treatments should be considered for these patients, such as exogenous gonadotropin therapy for women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and oocyte donation for women with ovarian failure (primary ovarian insufficiency). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;, section on 'Gonadotropin therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There have been concerns about the use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction because they could disrupt the normal aromatase activity during early fetal development and therefore be potentially teratogenic if administered inadvertently during early pregnancy. This issue is discussed below.

While ovulation may occasionally occur, spontaneous conception is unlikely. Induction of ovulation in these women is aimed at inducing monofollicular development, subsequent ovulation, and, ultimately, pregnancy and birth of a healthy newborn.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clomiphene</a> citrate has historically been the drug of choice for ovulation induction in women with PCOS. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> has been tried as an alternative, but it appears to be less effective for live birth rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-for-treatment-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metformin for treatment of the polycystic ovary syndrome&quot;</a>).

The starting dose is 2.5 mg administered days 3 to 7; this can be titrated up to a maximum dose of 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> if ovulation has not occurred. However, before starting letrozole, the clinician <strong>must</strong> discuss with the patient that this is an off-label use of the drug and that there are alternatives (clomiphene citrate) that are approved. In addition, as with any ovulation induction agent, one must confirm that the patient is not pregnant before starting therapy. We suggest a blood pregnancy test before administering letrozole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with PCOS and a BMI &le;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> we suggest either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a> for ovulation induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Live birth rates appear to be similar for both. Of note, clomiphene citrate is approved for fertility treatment while letrozole is not approved for this indication. With clomiphene, we start with clomiphene citrate 50 mg days 5 to 9 (some clinicians treat days 3 to 7) and increase to a maximum dose of 100 mg if the patient does not respond to 50 mg. If the patient does not ovulate with clomiphene citrate 100 mg, we suggest a trial of letrozole before moving to gonadotropin therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;, section on 'Gonadotropin therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate are pregnancy category X. Although evidence so far suggests that letrozole is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, safety data are based upon a relatively small number of pregnancies. In contrast, clomiphene citrate is approved for ovulation induction and has been widely used for over 40 years. The majority of clinical trial and epidemiologic studies suggest that the rate of congenital anomalies is similar to that for spontaneous pregnancies, and longitudinal follow-up of children born to mothers who took clomiphene citrate have no evidence of developmental delays or learning disabilities.

The addition of letrozole to gonadotropin therapy appears to reduce the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) required to achieve optimal COH, without adverse antiestrogenic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/10,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,33-36</a>]. In one report of combined letrozole and FSH administration, the FSH dose required was 45 to 55 percent lower than with standard regimens, and there were no peripheral antiestrogenic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-letrozole/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As gonadotropin therapy is expensive, lowering the FSH dose requirements could result in an important cost reduction.

Similar results were seen in the clomiphene and letrozole groups, with a significantly lower FSH dose requirement during COH. Letrozole was not associated with antiestrogenic effects as demonstrated by the significantly lower endometrial thickness with clomiphene citrate, despite higher serum estradiol concentrations.
