Reduced biliary excretion leads to accumulation of copper, initially in the liver and then in other tissues, particularly the brain. Tissue copper deposition causes a multitude of signs and symptoms that reflect hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and renal impairment. The incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin is also impaired.</p><p>Patients most often present with liver disease (which can range from asymptomatic elevations in the serum aminotransferase or bilirubin concentrations to fulminant hepatic failure to chronic hepatitis) or with neuropsychiatric disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H69500435\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of Wilson disease. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Wilson disease are discussed separately.

Our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lifetime therapy aimed primarily at treating copper overload is required in patients with Wilson disease, and treatment should be considered in two phases: removing or detoxifying the tissue copper that has accumulated and preventing reaccumulation. Copper removal is achieved by the administration of potent chelators. The primary chelator that has been used is D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>. However, approximately 30 percent of patients do not tolerate long-term therapy because of side effects and it may not be the treatment of choice in patients with neurologic symptoms. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trientine</a> has traditionally been used as a second-line agent for those intolerant of D-penicillamine, but it is also a reasonable option for primary therapy, and may be the preferred treatment because of its lower incidence of side effects. There are no controlled trials that have compared these agents to one another and thus recommendations for their use are based mainly on observational data and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Prevention of reaccumulation can be achieved with chelators or by use of zinc salts. Typically doses of chelation can be reduced by approximately 33 percent from that used for initial treatment and copper removal. Oral zinc acts by preventing copper absorption by increasing the endogenous chelator metallothionein in enteric cells, but may also increase the levels of metallothionein in the liver itself. A newer agent, tetrathiomolybdate (another chelating agent), was shown in a prospective trial to be an effective treatment for those presenting with neurologic signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Tetrathiomolybdate is still being evaluated in a new clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>To further prevent accumulation or reaccumulation of copper, patients with Wilson disease should also be maintained on a low copper diet and avoid copper-rich foods. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Dietary recommendations'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who may have been well treated but stop taking treatment may develop new neurologic abnormalities or rapidly progressive hepatic decompensation refractory to treatment and requiring liver transplantation. Monitoring of therapy is critical to detect non-adherence or failure of medical therapy.</p><p>Other aspects of treatment for patients with Wilson disease include pharmacologic or interventional treatment of complications of portal hypertension in those with ascites or esophageal or gastric varices, and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy if present. Additional treatment of neurologic symptoms such as tremor or parkinsonism and psychiatric symptoms independent of treatment of the copper overload may improve patients' quality of life and should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">D-penicillamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> contains a free sulfhydryl group that functions as a copper chelating moiety. Its major effect is to remove copper from less tightly bound sites on proteins, peptides, and membranes, and promote its urinary excretion, although it may also function by other mechanisms such as stimulation of endogenous metallothionein. It has also been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cystinuria, and lead and mercury poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Penicillamine</a> is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Its absorption is decreased by as much as 50 percent when taken with food. More than 80 percent is excreted by the kidneys. Its half-life is in the range of 1.7 to 7 hours, although there may be considerable individual variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The drug should be introduced at a dose of 250 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and then increased by 250 mg increments every four to seven days to a maximum of 1000 to 1500 mg daily in two to four divided doses. For children and adults who weigh less than 100 lb (45 kg), we recommend starting with 250 mg daily with a maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per kg (rounded to the nearest 250 mg) or approximately 1000 mg in two or three divided doses. This regimen may reduce the incidence of early adverse side effects such as fever and rash, but does not appear to reduce the incidence of late-onset toxicity, such as the nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects and their management'</a> below.) </p><p>A lower dose (750 to 1000 mg daily in two divided doses) is sufficient during the maintenance phase (usually after four to six months). The therapeutic response to changes in the maintenance dose usually will not become evident for four to six weeks.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Penicillamine</a> should ideally be given one hour before or two hours after meals since food interferes with its absorption. However, some patients may require dosing closer to food intake, which is an acceptable compromise if the patient is shown to be stable, as it increases compliance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> in patients with Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-16</a>]. Clinical improvement in patients with advanced liver disease is usually observed during the first two to six months of therapy, but can continue thereafter. Even advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis may show reversibility following prolonged treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A repeat liver biopsy is not necessary to monitor tissue copper serially as long as there is a progressive improvement in symptoms and liver biochemical tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects and their management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Penicillamine</a> is associated with multiple side effects leading up to approximately 5 percent of patients to discontinue therapy. Other treatments should probably be used in patients who are at increased risk for toxicity including those with a history of renal disease, severe thrombocytopenia, or an autoimmune tendency. Crossreactivity to penicillin may occur. Thus the drug should be used cautiously in patients with known penicillin allergy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early sensitivity reactions (occurring within one to three weeks of beginning therapy) are characterized by fever, cutaneous eruptions, lymphadenopathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria. The drug should be discontinued immediately in such patients and alternative treatment (principally <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trientine</a> or zinc) begun. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Trientine'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Oral zinc'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prior to the availability of alternative treatments, patients could be desensitized to these reactions to D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> by stopping the medicine for one week, then restarting it at a dose of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> after which it was doubled at weekly intervals as long as it was tolerated. Some patients were also treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> during this desensitization period. Desensitization is now rarely required due to the availability of alternative oral therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several side effects occurring months to years after initiating therapy have also been described. The appearance of proteinuria may herald the onset of nephrotic syndrome, which may occur early or years after treatment begins. The onset of nephrotic syndrome necessitates cessation of the drug. However, protein excretion of up to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> produces no symptoms and may not progress. Although cessation of therapy always leads to resolution of the proteinuria, the mean time required for this to occur is approximately one year and some patients take more than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A much less common but more serious renal complication is the development of a crescentic glomerulonephritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other later reactions include Goodpasture syndrome, bone marrow toxicity including severe thrombocytopenia or total aplasia, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, hepatotoxicity, loss of taste, and a lupus-like syndrome characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, and a positive antinuclear antibody.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes have been described including elastosis perforans serpiginosa pemphigus, lichen planus, and aphthous stomatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are dose-related signs of gastric irritation and improve if the dose is reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aplastic anemia is rare but may not reverse with the cessation of therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neurologic status of patients with predominantly neurologic symptoms may worsen with the initiation of treatment with D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>. Limited data suggest that approximately 10 percent of such patients will have neurologic deterioration after beginning treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. Furthermore, new neurologic symptoms may appear in some patients. These events may be caused by two potential mechanisms: mobilization of hepatic copper stores leading to increased brain copper exposure, or the development of intracellular copper complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although some patients recover with continued use, the manufacturer recommends that the drug should be stopped (and an alternative used) in patients who develop worsening neurologic symptoms (other than loss of taste). Although there are limited data, generally a switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trientine</a> or to zinc should be considered in these patients. For severely symptomatic patients and for those individuals whose symptoms worsen on D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> or trientine alone, we consider using combination therapy. Zinc may be added to the regimen of patients on D-penicillamine or trientine. While the use of combination therapy has not been established by randomized trials, the complementary actions of zinc and chelating agents (preventing copper absorption and removal of copper, respectively) has a theoretical advantage over either treatment alone. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Oral zinc'</a> below.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Zinc should be given several hours apart from the D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> agent and needs to be given at least twice daily. The combination of D-penicillamine and zinc may increase the risk for development of sideroblastic anemia (an uncommon complication); thus, we monitor hemoglobin levels. Worsening of neurologic symptoms has been described with other copper chelators including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trientine</a>, although possibly less frequently than with D-penicillamine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Penicillamine</a> inactivates pyridoxine. Thus, small doses of pyridoxine, 25 mg per day, should be given to patients treated with D-penicillamine to prevent pyridoxal phosphate deficiency.</p><p/><p>Copper deficiency induced by D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> can lead to iron overload in the liver. Although the clinical significance is uncertain, excess iron may contribute to liver injury. This only occurs with high-dose therapy maintained for a long period of time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring D-penicillamine therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compliance is often a problem, particularly in children. It can be ascertained by measuring 24-hour urinary copper excretion or experimentally by determining the presence of D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> in urine by amino acid analysis. The binding of copper to D-penicillamine is stoichiometric. Thus, the amount of copper excreted in the urine will increase with increasing dosing of D-penicillamine. The presence of elevated serum aminotransferases does not necessarily indicate non-compliance since up to one-third of children continue to have mildly elevated aminotransferases despite adequate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The initial goal of therapy is increasing urinary copper excretion from baseline levels (often above 100 mcg per day in symptomatic patients). Copper excretion in the urine in previously untreated patients on D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> can reach levels of 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> (32 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span>. The rate of copper excretion falls as copper stores become depleted. Values usually fall to below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> (8 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span> at approximately 6 to 12 months. Once the excess copper is removed, patients can be switched to maintenance therapy. Prior to switching to maintenance therapy, patients should be clinically well, have stable, normal, or near normal serum aminotransferases and hepatic synthetic function, have a normal nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration (&lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> or 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> and have 24-hour urinary copper repeatedly in the range of 200 to 500 mcg (3 to 8 micromol) per day on treatment. Most patients require at least six months to a year of chelation therapy to achieve these goals.</p><p>We obtain a complete blood count, urinalysis, and serum creatinine after the first week and at every month during the first three months, at three-month intervals until stable target values are achieved, and twice per year thereafter. The manufacturer recommends that treatment should be withdrawn if the total white blood cell count falls below 3000 cells per mm<sup>3</sup>, neutrophils fall below 2000 cells per mm<sup>3</sup>, platelets fall below 120,000 per mm<sup>3</sup>, or if a steady decline over three successive tests is observed, even though the counts remain above the values set for discontinuation. In patients with portal hypertension and hypersplenism, the platelet count and white blood cell count may be low prior to the initiation of D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>, and these patients can continue therapy with close monitoring. Patients on long-term treatment with this medication should be periodically monitored for proteinuria and for iron overload.</p><p>D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> should also be withheld (and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trientine</a> or zinc begun) if proteinuria exceeds 2+ on a dipstick, if red cell or white casts are observed at microscopic examination of the urine, or if more than 10 red cells are seen per high-power field. Our approach is to switch to trientine or zinc if there are any signs of renal toxicity given that there is significant experience with these drugs and it appears they have fewer side effects than D-penicillamine, though some authors would continue D-penicillamine if quantitative proteinuria does not exceed 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and is stable. D-penicillamine should be permanently discontinued if proteinuria exceeds 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or the glomerular filtration rate falls. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose adjustments prior to surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment should <strong>never</strong> be discontinued altogether for any significant period of time without careful monitoring; patients who stop therapy for Wilson disease are at risk for the development of hepatic decompensation and acute liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. It is reasonable to reduce the dose of D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> prior to surgery since laboratory and some human data suggest that it may impair wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Dose reductions during this time may be in the range of 25 to 50 percent of the presurgery dose, and full doses may be resumed after wound healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">D-penicillamine and pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical experience suggests that D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> is safe during pregnancy, though the drug is teratogenic in animal studies. Successful pregnancies without teratogenicity have also been described in the published literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>], though there are reports of women taking D-penicillamine giving birth to neonates with cutaneous abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Stopping therapy is associated with a high risk of hemolytic episodes with hepatic insufficiency, including maternal fatality.</p><p>We agree with a guideline published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases that suggests treatment be maintained during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In patients on maintenance therapy, the dose should be reduced by 25 to 50 percent of the pre-pregnancy dose to reduce fetal risk early in the pregnancy and to promote better wound healing should a cesarean section be required. Monitoring of liver function and clinical status should be done each trimester to assure safety of the reduced dosing levels of medication. </p><p>In addition, one authority made the following comments in an editorial regarding a study of zinc in pregnant patients with Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mothers and infants tolerate pregnancy safely if they comply with prescribed regimens (750 mg to 1 g of either D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trientine</a> in patients with well controlled Wilson disease during the first two trimesters and 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> during the last trimester).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nursing mothers taking D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> report no ill effects on babies, although breast milk concentrations of zinc and copper may be reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relatively low doses of D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trientine</a> used to treat patients with Wilson disease have not been associated with teratogenicity.

It differs from D-penicillamine by a lack of sulfhydryl groups and chelates copper by forming a stable complex with its four constituent nitrogens. Like D-penicillamine, it also functions principally by removing copper from less strongly bound sites on proteins and membranes, and it increases renal copper excretion.</p><p>On a mole for mole basis, more copper is bound by D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trientine</a>; however, the amount of trientine used can be adjusted to achieve appropriate goals of therapy.

It may be prudent to test drinking water obtained from wells for copper content, or use appropriate filters that remove trace elements. Municipal water supplies usually do not require analysis. Patients who have copper pipes in the household should be advised to flush the system before using water for cooking or consumption. A detailed list of the mineral content of foods is available on the <a href=\"http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/index&amp;token=uZEjJoazfG9W6mVzHm408BkErVZeW4GVWwrvhIJLX6jXncyujOuwuzOmBUSPDWKd3wiN6bqk4UqSXaFptourqg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2209\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">US Department of Agriculture website</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE LIVER FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is useful to differentiate patients with acute liver failure due to Wilson disease from those with other causes of acute liver failure, as the therapeutic approach is different in patients with Wilson disease, and family screening can be performed on primary family members of the patient. Laboratory tests that suggest the acute liver failure is due to Wilson disease include an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio of &gt;2.2, an alkaline phosphatase to bilirubin ratio of &lt;4 (present together giving a sensitivity and specificity of 100 percent in adults with acute liver failure), a low hemoglobin due to non-immune mediated (Coombs negative) hemolytic anemia, and elevated serum copper above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Emergency liver transplantation must be considered early, and patients should immediately be referred to a transplant center urgently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H63223030\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Determining the cause of acute liver failure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis#H233807110\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'General management'</a>.)</p><p>Initial treatment must be aimed at the rapid removal of copper. Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and hemofiltration have been used to remove copper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In addition, plasma pheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma replacement is an option, as it can remove relatively large amounts of copper in a short period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Net copper removal is proportional to plasma concentration and can reach 12 mg per session. Most of these patients also have hemolytic anemia.

For those with advanced liver disease, a prognostic scoring system for children with Wilson disease presenting with failure was proposed by a group at Kings College and then later revised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. The revised system (based upon an index of serum bilirubin, the prothrombin time international normalized ratio [INR], aspartate aminotransferase level, and white blood cell count) had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for determining the need for liver transplantation of 93, 98, and 88 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. This scoring system has been validated in pediatric and adult patients. </p><p>Liver transplantation is curative for Wilson disease, and patients do not require treatment for Wilson disease following transplantation. Outcomes for liver transplantation for Wilson disease are excellent for those transplanted for acute liver failure or for liver failure from chronic liver disease. A review of the United Network for Organ Sharing database showed that pediatric and adult outcomes were better than long-term outcomes for patients transplanted for other disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. The series looked at the outcomes of 170 children transplanted for Wilson disease between 2002 and 2008 and 400 adults transplanted between 1987 and 2008. The one- and five-year survival rates were similar for children and adults. They were 90 and 89 percent, respectively, for children and were 88 and 86 percent, respectively, for adults. Pediatric patients with Wilson disease were more often transplanted for acute liver failure, whereas adults with Wilson disease were more often transplanted for with chronic liver failure. </p><p>Whether or not liver transplantation is indicated in patients with predominantly neurologic manifestations is controversial. This may be due in part to differences in the resolution of neurologic manifestations when the recipient also has extensive hepatic disease compared with those with neurologic manifestations as the principal indication for transplantation. Survival appears to be worse in patients with neurologic involvement.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series included 13 patients with Wilson disease who received a liver transplant, four of whom had intractable neurologic impairment as the only indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

Discontinuation of therapy can lead to the development of acute liver failure or other symptoms. Treatment should be given in two phases: stabilizing the patient by removing tissue copper that has accumulated and then preventing reaccumulation (maintenance).

Zinc may be used in patients who are reluctant to use a chelating agent or who are intolerant of them, but liver biochemical test should be monitored at least every four months and a chelating agent added if these tests worsen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Evolving consensus has been to use trientine because of its relatively favorable side-effect profile.

Maintenance therapy can be achieved with zinc or with lower doses of a chelator, and patients should be monitored regularly as described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy appears to be safe in patients on D-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trientine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trientine</a>, but we suggest the dose be reduced to approximately 30 to 50 percent of the pre-pregnancy dose during the first trimester since both drugs are known to be teratogenic in animal models and continued to term as treatment with higher doses may impair wound healing should a cesarean section or episiotomy be required (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
