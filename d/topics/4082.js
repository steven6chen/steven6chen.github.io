Epidemiologic studies are largely lacking, and the exact incidence and prevalence of acute pericarditis are unknown. However, acute pericarditis is recorded in approximately 0.1 to 0.2 percent of hospitalized patients and 5 percent of patients admitted to the Emergency Department for nonischemic chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study from an urban area in Northern Italy the incidence of acute pericarditis was 27.7 cases per 100,000 persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study from Finland that included 670,409 cardiovascular admissions to 29 hospitals across the country over a 9.5-year period, the standardized incidence rate for pericarditis requiring hospitalization was 3.3 cases per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>Acute pericarditis is a common disorder in several clinical settings, where it may be either the first manifestation of an underlying systemic disease or represent an isolated process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67851 \">table 1</a>). In developed countries, most cases of acute pericarditis are considered of possible or confirmed viral origin, although the exact etiology of most cases remains undetermined following a traditional diagnostic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Prior to the widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy to treat infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pericardial disease was the most frequent cardiovascular manifestation of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, in developed countries with access to HIV therapy, patients with HIV infection who develop acute pericarditis have an etiologic spectrum very similar to non-HIV infected patients. On the contrary, HIV infection and tuberculosis persist as major causes of acute pericarditis in developing countries.

In the remaining 85 percent of patients who were low risk, outpatient <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy was effective in 87 percent, and none of these patients had a serious complication (eg, cardiac tamponade) at a mean follow-up of 38 months.</p><p>Although chronic use of glucocorticoids should not be considered as a risk factor in a general population of patients with acute pericarditis, they were associated with an increased rate of complications in idiopathic or viral pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Glucocorticoid therapy given for the index attack may increase the chance of recurrence, possibly because of its deleterious effect on viral replication and clearance.

The chest pain of pericarditis must always be distinguished from other common <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life-threatening causes of chest pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54629 \">table 2</a>) such as myocardial ischemia, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and musculoskeletal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with chest pain in the emergency department&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chest pain that results from acute pericarditis is typically fairly sudden in onset and occurs over the anterior chest. Unlike pain from myocardial ischemia, chest pain due to pericarditis is most often sharp and pleuritic in nature, with exacerbation by inspiration or coughing. One of the most distinctive features is the tendency for a decrease in intensity when the patient sits up and leans forward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. This position (seated, leaning forward) tends to reduce pressure on the parietal pericardium, particularly with inspiration, and may also allow for splinting of the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Radiation of chest pain to the trapezius ridge has also been considered to be fairly specific for pericarditis. However, dull, oppressive pain may occur; in such cases, it is difficult to distinguish pericarditis from other causes of chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. </p><p>Chest pain is likely to be present in cases of acute pericarditis caused by infection, but may be minimal or absent in patients with uremic pericarditis or pericarditis associated with a rheumatologic disorder (although in some patients pleuritic chest pain and pericarditis can be the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardial friction rub</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a pericardial friction rub on physical examination is highly specific for acute pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56608\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56608 \">movie 1</a>). Classically, pericardial friction rubs are triphasic with a superficial scratchy or squeaking quality. Pericardial friction rubs are often intermittent, with an intensity that tends to wax and wane, and are best heard using the diaphragm of the stethoscope. </p><p>Pericardial friction rubs, which occur during maximal movement of the heart within its pericardial sac, are said to be generated by friction between the two inflamed layers of the pericardium. However, this commonly offered explanation for its mechanism may be an oversimplification as patients with a pericardial effusion may also have an audible friction rub. </p><p>The classic pericardial friction rub consists of three phases, corresponding to movement of the heart during atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the rapid filling phase of early ventricular diastole. Patients in atrial fibrillation lack atrial systole, and therefore will have a two phase rub. Additionally, for uncertain reasons, some rubs are present only during one (one component) or two phases (two components) of the cardiac cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a review of auscultation and phonocardiography in 100 patients with a pericardial rub, the rub was triphasic in 56 percent of patients in sinus rhythm, biphasic in 33 percent, and monophasic in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Pericardial rubs may be localized or widespread, but are usually loudest over the left sternal border [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The intensity of the rub frequently increases after application of firm pressure with the diaphragm, during suspended respiration, and with the patient leaning forward or resting on elbows and knees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86234\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86234 \">picture 1</a>). This last maneuver is designed to increase contact between visceral and parietal pericardium, but is seldom used in practice since it is cumbersome for the patient.</p><p>Friction rubs tend to vary in intensity and can come and go over a period of hours; therefore, the sensitivity for detection of a rub is variable and depends in large part on the frequency of auscultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Pericardial rubs may be easier to hear in patients without a pericardial effusion, but this finding is not universal and is not well-documented. In a report of 100 patients with acute pericarditis, a pericardial rub was present in 34 of 40 (85 percent) without an effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This prevalence is considerably higher than the 35 percent incidence of friction rubs reported in another series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Suspension of respiration during auscultation permits distinction of a pericardial friction rub from a pleuropericardial or pleural rub. A pleuropericardial rub results from the friction between the inflamed pleura and the parietal pericardium, while a pleural rub is the result of friction between the inflamed visceral and parietal pleura. As such, pleuropericardial and pleural rubs can be heard only during the inspiratory phase of respiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds#H49\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;, section on 'Pericardial friction rub and other adventitious sounds'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2297355\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ECG in acute pericarditis can evolve through as many as four stages of changes, and the temporal evolution of ECG changes can be highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. The four stages of typical ECG changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115268 \">figure 1</a>) in patients with acute pericarditis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1, seen in the first hours to days, is characterized by diffuse ST elevation (typically concave up) with reciprocal ST depression in leads aVR and V1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77572\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77572 \">waveform 1</a>). There is also frequently an atrial current of injury, reflected by elevation of the PR segment in lead aVR and depression of the PR segment in other limb leads and in the left chest leads, primarily V5 and V6. Thus, the PR and ST segments typically change in opposite directions. PR segment deviation, which is highly specific though less sensitive, is frequently overlooked. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The TP segment is recommended as the baseline for comparison when measuring both PR and ST segment changes in acute pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2, typically seen in the first week, is characterized by normalization of the ST and PR segments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 is characterized by the development of diffuse T-wave inversions, generally <strong>after</strong> the ST segments have become isoelectric. Its duration is not well-documented and likely highly variable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 4 is represented by normalization of the ECG.</p><p/><p>However, pericarditis does not always result in these typical ECG changes. Many patients normalize without going past stage 1. Moreover, atypical ECG changes are seen in up to 40 percent of patients with acute pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Additionally, localized ST-elevation and T-wave inversion occur before ST-segment normalization in a minority of patients with acute pericarditis without myocardial involvement. These changes can simulate ECG changes seen in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H2301545\" class=\"local\">'ECG differentiation from acute myocardial infarction'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-st-and-t-wave-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Changes in the ECG in patients with acute pericarditis signify <strong>inflammation of the epicardium</strong>, since the parietal pericardium itself is electrically inert. However, some causes of pericarditis do not result in significant inflammation of the epicardium and, as such, may not alter the ECG. An illustration of this is uremic pericarditis, in which there is prominent fibrin deposition but little or no epicardial inflammation. As a result, the ECG often shows none of the changes associated with pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericarditis-in-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericarditis in renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The temporal evolution of ECG changes with acute pericarditis is highly variable from one patient to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Treatment can accelerate or alter ECG progression. The duration of the ECG changes in pericarditis also depends upon its cause and the extent of the associated myocardial damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Sustained arrhythmias are uncommon in acute pericarditis, except in the post-thoracotomy setting. This was illustrated in a review of 100 consecutive patients in which only seven arrhythmias were identified; all were atrial and all occurred in patients with underlying heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a separate report comparing patients with myopericarditis and simple acute pericarditis, cardiac arrhythmias were also more commonly present in patients with myopericarditis (odds ratio 17.6, 95% CI 5.7-54.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic cases, most of which are probably viral in etiology, are the most common causes of acute pericarditis. Other etiologies of acute pericarditis include bacterial infections, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60949 \">table 5</a>). The distribution of etiologies varies with geography and type of clinical setting (community hospital versus tertiary referral center). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute pericarditis can present with a variety of nonspecific signs and symptoms, depending on the underlying etiology. The major clinical manifestations of acute pericarditis include pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, and ECG changes, with or without a pericardial effusion. Pericarditis should also be suspected in a patient with persistent fever and pericardial effusion or new unexplained cardiomegaly. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk patients with acute pericarditis should be admitted in order to initiate appropriate therapy and to expedite a thorough initial evaluation. Patients with high-risk features are at increased risk of short-term complications and have a higher likelihood of a specific disease. Conversely, patients with uncomplicated (ie, low-risk) acute pericarditis can usually be evaluated and sent home, with outpatient follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H2069143697\" class=\"local\">'Determination of risk and need for hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with suspected acute pericarditis, the initial evaluation includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, selective blood work (assessing for markers of inflammation or myocardial damage), chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Follow-up testing should be performed on a case by case basis and may include blood cultures, additional bloodwork (eg, ANA titer, HIV serology, etc), and additional cardiac imaging. (See <a href=\"#H588745323\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute pericarditis is diagnosed by the presence of at least two of the following criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74376 \">table 6</a>) (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Typical chest pain (sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Chest pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pericardial friction rub (a superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left sternal border) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56608\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56608 \">movie 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pericardial friction rub'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suggestive changes on the ECG (typically widespread ST segment elevation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77572\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77572 \">waveform 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2297355\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>New or worsening pericardial effusion. (See <a href=\"#H2298690\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the relatively benign course associated with the common causes of pericarditis, along with the relatively low yield of much of the diagnostic testing, it is not necessary to establish a definite etiology in all patients with acute pericarditis. Initial efforts should focus upon excluding a significant pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade and the identification of patients in whom a more comprehensive evaluation should be performed to exclude causes that require specific therapy (eg, malignancy, tuberculosis or purulent pericarditis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67851 \">table 1</a>).
