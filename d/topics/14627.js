Pulmonary complications are a common cause of morbidity and occasionally mortality following this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Certain aspects of the transplant procedure influence the later development of pulmonary disease; the pretransplant conditioning regimen and posttransplant immunosuppression contribute to direct lung toxicity and increase the risk of opportunistic infections. </p><p>The pulmonary complications of allogeneic HCT will be reviewed here. The determination of eligibility for HCT, infectious complications of HCT, supportive care following HCT, and pulmonary complications of <strong>autologous</strong> HCT are discussed separately.

Progenitor cells can come from a variety of sources (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H895198\"><span class=\"h2\">Allogeneic versus autologous HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic HCT refers to the use of hematopoietic progenitor cells collected from a relative (which can be human leukocyte antigen [HLA] identical, haploidentical, or mismatched) or an unrelated donor (volunteer or umbilical cord donor). Autologous HCT refers to collection of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the patient prior to the administration of high dose chemotherapy designed to target an underlying malignancy, followed by reinfusion of these cells. </p><p>Many of the pulmonary complications of allogeneic HCT also occur with autologous HCT, but there are some important differences. Prevention of graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic HCT necessitates more intense immunosuppression than that required for autologous HCT, which does not have these complications. Allogeneic grafts may be associated with development of potentially detrimental GVHD. On the other hand, some allogeneic HCT patients may benefit from a graft-versus-tumor effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of the graft-versus-tumor effect following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Autologous HCT is discussed separately.

Preparative regimens for HCT have been termed myeloablative (eg, total body irradiation &ge;5 Gy, high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>), nonmyeloablative (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, antithymocyte globulin, irradiation &le;2 Gy), and reduced intensity (eg, low dose busulfan, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>). The various preparative conditioning regimens are discussed in greater detail separately.

Time to engraftment is variable, and dependent on multiple variables, including cell source, graft composition, and type of conditioning.</p><p>At the time of engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells, patients may develop a cytokine-driven engraftment syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H6458592\" class=\"local\">'Engraftment syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H895268\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After allogeneic HCT, maintenance immunosuppression is administered to prevent graft rejection and GVHD. A commonly used regimen is the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and a calcineurin inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>; alternative or additional agents include glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and also agents targeting T cell depletion. These agents contribute to the risk of pulmonary toxicity and opportunistic infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1426020\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft-versus-host disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non-identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes disease in the transplant recipient. Hyperacute GVHD, which is rare with current HLA typing, occurs in the first 14 days post HCT, acute GVHD in the first 100 days, and chronic GVHD after the first 100 days, although the specific timing is approximate. Despite preconditioning and maintenance immunosuppression to prevent GVHD, a substantial proportion of allogeneic HCT recipients are affected by GVHD. GVHD in turn may increase the risk of certain pulmonary complications, such as the idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans, and late-occurring infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88599790\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The types of pulmonary complications that occur following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) vary based on the time since the transplant occurred, although some complications can occur both early and late (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83194 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83195\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83195 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88599890\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-engraftment period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the pre-engraftment period from HCT up to engraftment (eg, about 0 to 30 days post HCT), the differential diagnosis of pulmonary complications includes infection, pulmonary edema due to cardiac and noncardiac causes such as sepsis syndrome or aspiration, and the engraftment syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83194 \">table 1</a>). Symptoms and signs are nonspecific and include fever, dyspnea, cough, and hypoxemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193827185\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections due to aerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria, fungi, and certain viruses occur in up to 10 percent of HCT recipients in the pre-engraftment phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In addition to the effects of neutropenia, mucositis from the conditioning regimen contributes to the risk of infection via swallowing difficulties, aspiration, and possibly impaired mucociliary clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Distinguishing clinical, radiographic, and other diagnostic features of these infections are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83194 \">table 1</a>). A general approach to lung infection in immunocompromised patients and the spectrum of infections that complicate HCT is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infections-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H12424964\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Pneumonia'</a>.)</p><p>Among 427 consecutive allogeneic recipients, bacterial pneumonia developed in the first post-HCT month in 4 percent; fungal pneumonia in 9 percent, and viral pneumonia in 2 percent; 4 percent had suspected pneumonia without a specific organism being identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pneumonia was a major contributor to mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The most common bacterial causes of pneumonia were <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. </p><p>HCT recipients are at risk for serious lung infection due to respiratory virus infections, such as influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) especially PIV 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Lymphopenia appears to be an important risk factor for respiratory virus infection. </p><p><em>Aspergillus</em> pneumonia in neutropenic patients may present with the classic triad of fever, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis, although this triad is frequently not present. The radiographic appearance is varied and includes single or multiple nodules with or without cavitation, patchy or segmental consolidation, or peribronchial opacities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70038 \">image 1</a>). A characteristic feature of <em>Aspergillus</em> nodules in the neutropenic patient is a surrounding ground glass opacity (the halo sign) that reflects angioinvasion and hemorrhage into the surrounding tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56195\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56195 \">image 2</a>). However, the halo sign is not specific to <em>Aspergillus</em> and can be seen with other fungi, such as <em>Fusarium</em> spp, agents of <em>Mucormycosis</em>, and <em>Scedosporium</em> spp.</p><p><em>Candida</em> pneumonitis is rare due to the frequent use of prophylaxis with antifungal azole derivatives. In a case series of <em>Candida</em> pneumonitis in HCT recipients, the typical presentation was fever unresponsive to board-spectrum antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. CT findings included multiple nodules ranging from 3 to 30 mm in diameter in 15 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Air-space consolidation was present in 11 patients and in five, nodules were surrounded by discrete areas of ground-glass opacity (CT halo sign). In those patients with acute lung injury due to <em>Candida</em> pneumonitis, the CT scan showed extensive ground glass opacities in addition to a focal area of consolidation. The bronchoalveolar lavage grew <em>Candida</em> in all patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193827060\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary edema of cardiogenic or noncardiogenic origin can occur in the first month after HCT, sometimes complicating other processes such as pneumonia, sepsis, the engraftment syndrome, or hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). (See <a href=\"#H6458592\" class=\"local\">'Engraftment syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H193827192\" class=\"local\">'Hyperacute and acute graft-versus-host disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Cardiac dysfunction can result from previous therapy for the primary disease with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, anthracyclines, or external beam chest irradiation. Among patients with mild cardiac dysfunction, the administration of large volumes of intravenous fluids because of mucositis or antibiotic treatment for neutropenic fever can lead to pulmonary edema. The radiographic manifestations of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include interlobular septal thickening, cephalad vascular distribution, ground glass opacification (sometimes in a perihilar &quot;butterfly&quot; distribution) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58394\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58394 \">image 3</a>), pleural effusions, and sometimes cardiomegaly. The plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is usually elevated and the echocardiogram shows left ventricular dysfunction. The evaluation of cardiogenic pulmonary edema is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can be induced by sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, viral infection (eg, influenza) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], toxic effects of the conditioning regimen, or hyperacute GVHD.

The engraftment syndrome usually causes only mild symptoms, but can result in dyspnea, fever &ge;38.3&#730;C, an erythematous maculo-papular rash (not attributable to a drug), weight gain, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary opacities consistent with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>]. </p><p>The pulmonary manifestations of the engraftment syndrome are felt to be due to diffuse capillary leakage. Findings on chest computed tomography include bilateral ground-glass opacification, hilar or peribronchial consolidation, and thickening of interlobular septa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22,23</a>].

In two patients who underwent lung biopsy, diffuse alveolar damage was noted.</p><p>The presence of a skin rash raises the possibility that the engraftment syndrome is a manifestation of hyperacute GVHD. However, the exact findings on skin biopsy in patients with engraftment syndrome include mild edematous changes of the epidermal-dermal junction, absence of lymphocytic infiltration, presence of neutrophils in the lumen of small venules and capillaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, skin biopsy in acute GVHD typically shows interface dermatitis (vacuolization of the basal layer of the epidermis and a lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis) and epidermal apoptotic keratinocytes. However, the accuracy of differentiation of these processes by skin biopsy is unclear.

Total body irradiation and chronic GVHD (requiring enhanced immunosuppressive therapy) are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis. Allogeneic HCT is associated with depressed delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, so skin testing with purified protein derivative (PPD) is not likely to be helpful.

High resolution computed tomography of the chest is more sensitive than the plain chest radiograph and may detect subtle interstitial disease. Echocardiography is often performed to assess for cardiac dysfunction or evidence of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. (See <a href=\"#H464750157\" class=\"local\">'Airflow obstruction and bronchiolitis obliterans'</a> above and <a href=\"#H193827220\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allogeneic HCT recipients who develop fever and radiographic lung opacities usually require empiric antibiotics, especially in the presence of neutropenia. Empiric antibiotics are chosen based on the patient's risk for specific infections, the potential sites of infection, the susceptibility patterns at a given institution, and the cost of the various regimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716 \">figure 1</a>).
