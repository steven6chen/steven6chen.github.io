Telomeric DNA consists of tandem repeats of the six-base TTAGGG sequence. Most of the telomeric DNA exists as duplex DNA, with a terminal single-stranded overhang of typically approximately 150 to 200 nucleotides of the G-rich strand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The shortening of the duplex DNA portion of telomeres is most characteristic of telomere biology disorders.</p><p>At birth, the length of telomeric DNA from somatic cells such as lymphocytes, ranges from 8 to 14 kilobases (kb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With each cell division, 50 to 100 base pairs of this telomeric DNA is removed due to incomplete replication of the 3' ends. When telomeres reach a critically short threshold, the cell can no longer divide properly and undergoes apoptosis or senescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In most somatic cells, shortening of telomere length is a normal consequence of aging. As an example, average lymphocyte telomere length declines from approximately 11 kb at birth to only approximately 4 kb in centenarians. Thus, telomeres have been referred to as the &quot;biological clock&quot; within a cell that determines the number of possible cell divisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Mitosis and DNA replication'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to the limited normal replicative capacity of most somatic cells, certain cell types that require constant replicative regeneration are capable of restoring and maintain longer telomere length to enable a greater number of divisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Examples include embryonic stem cells, multipotent stem cells in high-turnover tissues such as epithelial tissues, and bone marrow, and malignant tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This increased replicative capacity is made possible by the action of the telomerase complex, a ribonuclear protein complex (RNA and proteins) that counteracts telomere shortening by adding back DNA to the ends of chromosomes. The ability of telomerase to lengthen telomeres is regulated by several other mechanisms. The nucleoprotein factors contributing to these mechanisms, and consequently the genes encoding these factors in which mutations lead to telomere biology disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112304\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112304 \">figure 1</a>), have been subdivided into five categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telomerase activity &ndash; Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that adds TTAGGG repeats to the chromosome end. It consists of TERT, a catalytic protein; and TR, an RNA template. Assembly and stability of telomerase requires the action of several small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) including dyskerin, NHP2, and NOP10. The protein encoded by <em>NAF1</em> is a box <span class=\"nowrap\">H/ACA</span> RNA biogenesis factor similar to dyskerin that may regulate TR levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telomerase trafficking and recruitment to telomeres &ndash; Once telomerase is assembled, it must be recruited to the telomere. Trafficking mediated by the protein TCAB1, which binds to TR directly, is critical to this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The shelterin complex, which consists of the proteins TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, and POT1, serves the function of creating a &quot;t-loop&quot; (TRF2), resulting in the recruitment of additional proteins that create a stable telomere &quot;cap.&quot; TRF1 and TRF2 recruit TNF2 to the telomere, which in turn recruits a heterodimer of <span class=\"nowrap\">TPP1/POT1</span>. TPP1 then recruits telomerase to the telomere via its TEL patch motif [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telomere replication &ndash; The <span class=\"nowrap\">CTC1/STN1/TEN1</span> (CST) complex promotes extension of the C-rich strand of telomere DNA after telomerase has elongated the G-rich strand of telomere DNA, creating extension of the duplex telomere DNA component.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telomere stability &ndash; RTEL1 (regulator of telomere length 1) is a DNA helicase that contributes both to integrity of duplex telomere DNA replication as well as to the dismantling of structures called D-Loops that could otherwise result in telomere DNA loss through excision repair mechanisms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unknown or multifactorial roles &ndash; While TIN2 contributes to telomerase recruitment, mutations in the gene encoding TIN2 appear to play a dominant-negative role in telomere maintenance through as yet undetermined mechanisms. In addition, the exoribonuclease PARN may impact RNA transcript stability of other telomerase associated factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>In telomere biology disorders (also called short telomere syndromes or telomeropathies), mutations in the genes encoding any of the above factors implicated in telomere function lead to abnormally short telomeres (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112304\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112304 \">figure 1</a>). Mutations known to cause DC and related telomere biology disorders encode the proteins involved in telomerase activity and trafficking, formation of the shelterin &quot;capping&quot; complex, and telomere stability. These mutations and their associated inheritance patterns and named syndromes are listed below. (See <a href=\"#H2322535133\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4036819817\" class=\"local\">'Inheritance patterns'</a> below.)</p><p>Compared with the normal rate of telomere shortening in unaffected individuals of approximately 60 bp per year, individuals with telomere disorders lose telomeric DNA at approximately 120 bp per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Furthermore, successive generations of affected individuals may be born with progressively shorter telomeres (a phenomenon known as disease anticipation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Premature telomere shortening in telomere biology disorders leads to premature cell death, senescence, or genomic instability, which in turn leads to impaired organ and tissue function, altered homeostasis, or inappropriate growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Clinical consequences are described below. (See <a href=\"#H4131953407\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>DC is the prototypic short telomere syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. It is one of several inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, each of which is characterized by its own spectrum of associated clinical findings. However, the initial descriptions of DC, referred to at the time as Zinsser-Cole-Engman syndrome, focused on its skin findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Subsequently, the classic triad of abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia have come to define DC. However, other well-recognized complications are often the major causes of morbidity in DC, particularly bone marrow failure.</p><p>In addition to DC and the short telomere syndromes, certain inherited and acquired cancer syndromes are associated with mutations in telomerase complex and shelterin complex without bone marrow failure. Examples include familial melanoma, leukemias, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited susceptibility to melanoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to the short telomere syndromes, the abnormally short telomeres in certain progeria (premature aging) syndromes appear to affect different populations of cells; there is virtually no clinical overlap between premature aging syndromes and telomeropathies, with the exception of increased mortality due to disease complications in both cases.

These females are considered unaffected carriers; however, a retrospective analysis of six heterozygous individuals found that five had nail dystrophy and skin pigmentation changes characteristic of DC, and two had clinically significant delays in wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285322143\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true prevalence of DC and other short telomere syndromes is unknown, in large part due to the incomplete penetration of disease features in many individuals with short telomeres. Patients with subtle findings may receive other diagnoses such as idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or sporadic congenital abnormalities. Additionally, it is likely that many other individuals with gene mutations affecting telomere length may have a more subtle clinical phenotype. At the other extreme, it is conceivable that severe forms of DC may be underdiagnosed due to high mortality rates.</p><p>With these caveats, the prevalence of DC has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 1 million people in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Patients are also at increased risk of a number of malignancies.

In a review of approximately 500 reported cases up to the year 2000 (ie, when diagnosis was based solely on clinical features, before the genetic basis for DC was identified), it was determined that approximately three-fourths of patients had at least one of these three classic manifestations, and slightly fewer than half had all three findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Notably, the median age at diagnosis was 14 years (range, birth to 75 years), which was approximately seven years later than that of Fanconi anemia in the same analysis. However, with increasing recognition of the features of DC, many patients are being diagnosed at younger ages. In some families, findings may become more severe in successive generations due to genetic anticipation.

This broadening of diagnosis has been spurred by research demonstrating the role of telomere dysfunction in the disease (see <a href=\"#H3064815994\" class=\"local\">'Role of telomeres'</a> above), assays for telomere length, and genetic testing for specific abnormalities known to affect telomeres.

Some experts consider most of these patients to have DC, whereas others will refer to these patients as having a telomere biology disorder, restricting the diagnosis of DC to patients who have classic mucocutaneous findings.

Additional clues to the underlying diagnosis may include isolated cytopenias, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic disease, immunodeficiencies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> early graying of the hair. The co-occurrence of bone marrow failure and pulmonary fibrosis is highly suggestive of an underlying telomere disorder, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H266660602\" class=\"local\">'Additional somatic features'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients in whom the diagnosis of DC is considered should have a thorough family history, personal medical history, and physical examination to assess for features of DC. It is especially important to identify DC when present because patients may benefit from surveillance for additional clinical manifestations including cancer and organ dysfunction; family members with a shared mutation but with less penetrant disease features may also be identified; and siblings who could serve as potential donors for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) must be screened for DC.

(See <a href=\"#H1252477881\" class=\"local\">'Classic DC presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>Subsequently, two different sets of diagnostic criteria have been adopted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first set of criteria, patients with any of the following combinations of features are defined as having DC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All three classic mucocutaneous findings of abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and leukoplakia (see <a href=\"#H1252477881\" class=\"local\">'Classic DC presentation'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One of three mucocutaneous features plus bone marrow failure and at least two other somatic features known to occur in DC (see <a href=\"#H266660602\" class=\"local\">'Additional somatic features'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Four or more features of the Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (eg, intrauterine growth retardation [IUGR], developmental delay, severe immune deficiency, bone marrow failure, cerebellar hypoplasia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or pulmonary fibrosis in the setting of a known pathogenic genetic variant affecting telomerase function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Two or more features of DC and laboratory evidence of short telomeres (ie, less than the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile for age by multicolor flow cytometry with fluorescence in situ hybridization [flow-FISH] in several subsets of lymphocytes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second set of criteria differentiates findings suggestive of DC versus testing required to definitively establish the diagnosis. In this scheme, suggestive findings that lead to a suspected diagnosis of DC include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At least two of the three classic mucocutaneous features </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One classic mucocutaneous feature plus two somatic features </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Progressive bone marrow failure, MDS, or AML </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Solid tumors associated with DC and that are otherwise atypical for age </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary fibrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Short lymphocyte telomeres (below the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile for age)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">According to these criteria, a pathogenic variant must be identified in a DC-associated gene to definitively establish the DC diagnosis.</p><p/><p>In addition to the above criteria, a family member of an index patient may be diagnosed with DC or at least with a telomere biology disorder if they share the same genetic variant with the proband and are identified to have short telomeres. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2340578354\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing and bone marrow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic testing for DC consists of telomere length analysis and genetic testing for specific mutations. (See <a href=\"#H2371487939\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.) </p><p>The approach used depends on the patient's presentation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Telomere length analysis</strong> &ndash; In all individuals with a de novo presentation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a family history consistent with a telomere disorder, flow-FISH (multi-color flow cytometry with fluorescence in situ hybridization) is performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes using peptide nucleic acid probes for telomeric DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/4,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,74</a>]. Average telomere length below the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile for age is considered indicative of abnormally short telomeres and is consistent with DC or a related telomere biology disorder. Even in cases with a known familial mutation, telomere length analysis is recommended to help predict the degree to which an individual family member may be affected by DC-related complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molecular sequencing </strong>&ndash; All patients who are suspected to have DC based on clinical criteria and telomere length analysis should have genetic testing performed to identify a causative mutation. This testing is critical for definitive establishment of a genetic diagnosis and enabling testing of first degree relatives for potential carrier or disease status, and to determine family member eligibility to be an HCT donor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are three general ways in which sequencing can be performed:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Sequential single gene testing</strong> &ndash; Single gene testing was initially the only method available for molecular testing in patients with DC. For the most part, this approach has been replaced by multi-gene next generation sequencing panels, which are more cost-effective and take less time than sequential single gene testing in most cases. However, for patients in whom mutations in a specific gene are highly suspected based on clinical presentation (eg, p.R1264H variant in <em>RTEL1</em> in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, <em>CTC1</em> mutations in patients presenting with features of Coats plus syndrome), this approach may be optimal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Next generation sequencing (NGS) panels</strong> &ndash; An NGS gene panel is generally the most recommended approach for identifying gene mutations in patients with DC. A number of commercial panels are available that include 11 genes with mutations associated with telomere biology disorders (see <a href=\"#H2322535133\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above). Results from these panels are typically available within six to eight weeks. Notably, though, these panels may vary in sensitivity, genes tested, and whether specific deletion duplication analysis is included.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Whole exome sequencing (WES)</strong> &ndash; WES, which uses NGS methods to sequence the entire exome (coding regions of genes), is also readily commercially available. WES has the advantage of being able to identify for mutations in novel genes not previously associated with telomere disorders. The disadvantages of WES are that coverage is often not 100 percent for all DC-associated genes (eg, TERC mutations cannot be identified by WES); insurance coverage may be hard to obtain and the turnaround time on testing is typically longer than for NGS panels.</p><p/><p>A list of clinical laboratories that perform telomere length testing and molecular genetic testing for DC is available on the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/y3+Lj0shalBW+L1ZyL4tryNPgji1PaJ6Kbd/o1hE9A6&amp;TOPIC_ID=100663\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Genetic Testing Registry website</a>, and additional information about NGS panels and WES is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Identification of a pathogenic DC mutation is considered diagnostic in the appropriate clinical setting, as noted above (see <a href=\"#H3526115133\" class=\"local\">'Clinical criteria'</a> above). However, negative results from genetic testing do not eliminate the possibility of DC, since a significant proportion of patients lack identifiable mutations. It is likely that additional genes involved in telomere maintenance will be discovered.</p><p>In addition to the above testing, determining whether a patient has bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome is often useful in the diagnosis of DC. Bone marrow failure (BMF) is defined as a hypocellular marrow, typically &lt;25 percent of the age expected cellularity, along with the presence of peripheral blood cytopenias. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is defined the presence of morphologic abnormalities along with characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Assessments for BMF and MDS should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (CBC) with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and absolute reticulocyte count (ARC). Patients with DC typically have elevated MCV and low ARC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin F (HbF; fetal hemoglobin) level. HbF is typically elevated in inherited BMF syndromes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (&gt;1 cm) for morphologic review. Typical bone marrow findings in DC include hypocellularity, decreased megakaryocytes, and some degree of dyspoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytogenetic studies on the bone marrow aspirate including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>G-banding analysis of at least 20 metaphases to assess for acquired chromosomal aberrations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>FISH analysis for specific aberrations including 5q-, monosomy 7, 7q-, trisomy 8, and 20q-.</p><p/><p>Notably, there are no pathognomonic bone marrow findings for DC; the bone marrow abnormalities may be indistinguishable from other inherited BMF syndromes and the CBC abnormalities and HbF level are seen in a number of conditions. </p><p>In contrast to the use of bone marrow examination for diagnosis, which is not required in all individuals, bone marrow for surveillance is an important part of the management of DC. (See <a href=\"#H927928934\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1261572184\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of DC depends on the presenting clinical features and may include other inherited or acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes or hematologic neoplasms, <span class=\"nowrap\">acquired/de</span> novo hematologic malignancies, other causes of congenital anomalies, and other causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other inherited BMF syndromes</strong> &ndash; Other inherited BMF syndromes include Fanconi anemia (FA), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), and congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT). Like DC, most of these syndromes can have variable presentations with variable cytopenias and degrees of bone marrow hypocellularity. Unlike DC, these disorders are not associated with pulmonary fibrosis or hepatic fibrosis, most of these patients do not have short telomeres, and they do not have pathogenic mutations in genes that encode telomerase components. These other syndromes and an approach to distinguishing among them is presented separately.

Like DC, they can present in childhood with multiple affected family members. Like DC, patients with these syndromes who have developed MDS or AML may have very short telomeres on diagnostic testing, but these short telomeres are due to the underlying clone and are only present in blood and bone marrow cells. Unlike DC, these syndromes are not associated with organ system involvement typical of DC or pathogenic mutations affecting telomerase components. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired BMF</strong> &ndash; Acquired causes of BMF include a number of infectious and toxic exposures, idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Like DC, these conditions are associated with cytopenias and bone marrow abnormalities. Unlike DC, these conditions are not associated with congenital anomalies, organ system involvement (with the exception of hepatitis in virally-induced aplastic anemia), or pathogenic mutations affecting telomerase components. Most of these acquired BMF conditions are not associated with short telomeres, with the exception of hepatitis-associated acquired aplastic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

It is caused by mutations in <em>RECQL4.</em> Patients who have poikiloderma with neutropenia have mutations in C16orf57, and present with skin dyspigmentation, telangiectasias, and atrophy, along with immune deficiency and neutropenia. Patients with pachyonychia congenita, caused by mutations in genes that encode keratin proteins, present with nail dystrophy, hypertrophic skin on <span class=\"nowrap\">palms/soles,</span> oral leukokeratosis that mimics leukoplakia, and hyperhidrosis. Unlike DC, patients with these conditions have normal telomere length, do not develop hypocellular BMF, and do not have mutations in genes that affect telomerase function.

There are numerous underlying causes, including infection, immune defects, hypersensitivities, and systemic disorders. Telomere disorders have been estimated to account for 1 to 3 percent of sporadic cases of pulmonary fibrosis and 8 to 15 percent of familial cases of pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/25,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,76</a>]. As noted above, families with pulmonary fibrosis and bone marrow hypoplasia have a very high likelihood of DC.

However, the treatment outlook may be improving with active exploration of the roles for certain telomere-directed treatments, including androgen therapy, as well as hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) regimens specifically designed for patients with telomere disorders. However, given the rarity of the telomere biology disorders and the complexity caused by the multisystem pathophysiology of these conditions, patients with DC should be managed by an expert center; the following discussion is intended as an overview of the major aspects of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H669065662\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial and ongoing screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients diagnosed with DC based on the above studies (see <a href=\"#H1689252523\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above) should have a comprehensive assessment, including family and medical history and a thorough physical examination, performed in a dedicated center with expertise in management of patients with telomere biology disorders. Specific aspects of initial and ongoing screening include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessment for bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">failure/myelodysplastic</span> syndrome &ndash; </strong>Initial screening for bone marrow failure (BMF) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) should include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and mean corpuscular volume (MCV, which is typically elevated in patients with DC); reticulocyte count; and bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">aspirate/biopsy</span> studies with cytogenetic assessments including G-banding metaphase karyotype analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for specific abnormalities including 5q-, <span class=\"nowrap\">7q-/monosomy</span> 7, trisomy 8, and 20q-.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ongoing screening and monitoring depends on the results of the initial screening:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with normal CBC, normal bone marrow cellularity, and no cytogenetic abnormality, ongoing screening with annual CBC with differential is sufficient, with any significant change in the CBC warranting repeat bone marrow studies and more frequent monitoring. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with moderate cytopenias not requiring transfusion support, CBC monitoring every three to six months and annual bone marrow studies are recommended. Any patient with cytogenetic abnormalities, morphologic features suggestive of worsening MDS such as excess blasts (see <a href=\"#H2790077520\" class=\"local\">'AML or MDS'</a> below) or with severe cytopenias approaching transfusion thresholds, more intensive monitoring is required, with planning for therapies directed at cytopenias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Screening and preventive care for solid tumors</strong> &ndash; Screening guidelines for solid tumors were established in 2015 for patients with DC and telomere biology disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Of note, screening may need to begin earlier than general guidelines indicate for patients who have previously undergone HCT, particularly for those affected by post-HCT graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Guidelines for specific cancers include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck</strong> &ndash; Thorough dental examinations (or oral surgery consultation as indicated, depending on the dentist's degree of experience with oral cancer) every six months beginning in early childhood (eg, age three to five years). Nasolaryngoscopy should be performed every one to three years beginning at age 10 by an otolaryngologist with specific experience in head and neck cancer. Preventive care education should focus on good oral hygiene as well as avoidance of smoking, oral tobacco products, and alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Anorectal cancer</strong> &ndash; Physical examination and stool for occult blood annually, beginning at age 12. Our center also begins anorectal endoscopy screening by age 18. Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination is recommended because HPV may play a role in the increased anorectal cancer incidence in DC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Esophageal cancer</strong> &ndash; Esophagoscopy screening is done every three to five years beginning by age 20. For patients with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, screening should start earlier and should be repeated annually.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Liver cancer</strong> &ndash; Initial screening should include liver enzyme testing, and bilirubin testing, and right upper quadrant ultrasound. Ongoing screening should consist of annual liver enzyme and bilirubin assessments, with liver ultrasound repeated every three to five years. Additional assessments for other hepatic manifestations are noted below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Preventative measures include avoidance of all alcohol consumption, and use of chelation therapy if iron overload from red blood cell transfusions has developed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-chelators-choice-of-agent-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron chelators: Choice of agent, dosing, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Skin cancer</strong> &ndash; Annual examinations by a dermatologist. Preventative education includes training of the patient and family in skin evaluations and sun protection measures such as sun avoidance and use of sunscreen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Gynecologic cancer</strong> &ndash; Annual gynecologic examinations beginning at age 16. As noted above, HPV vaccination is recommended due to the possible role of HPV in gynecologic cancers in individuals with DC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Lung cancer</strong> &ndash; Initial chest radiography beginning at age 40. Avoidance of smoking should be emphasized. Avoidance of other exposures that increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis are also important, as discussed below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary manifestations</strong> &ndash; Initial screening for pulmonary fibrosis should include pulse oximetry for Sp0<sub>2</sub> assessment, and, for patients over age seven who are able to comply, formal pulmonary function testing (PFT), including assessment of the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). For patients younger than age seven in whom pulmonary abnormalities are suspected, a six-minute walk test may be performed. Bubble echocardiography, which assesses for right-to-left shunting, should be performed in any patient with cyanosis, clubbing, or <span class=\"nowrap\">PFT/DLCO</span> testing suspicious for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatopulmonary syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PFTs should be repeated every three to five years if normal or annually if significant abnormalities are identified. The use of routine computed tomography (CT) scans for screening remains controversial in DC, given the concerns for radiation exposure; however, in patients with abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">PFT/DLCO</span> testing, CT may be useful to further define the extent of pulmonary fibrosis present. In patients who have undergone HCT, initial <span class=\"nowrap\">PFT/DLCO</span> assessment is recommended one year after HCT to determine the frequency of ongoing follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Education to avoid exposures that increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis is highly recommended for patients with DC, as well as for family members who are asymptomatic but possess telomere disorder-associated familial gene mutations. Exposures for which avoidance is recommended include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tobacco or marijuana smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drugs associated with lung dysfunction (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elective general anesthesia when possible, due to associated injury of lung epithelium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Occupational environments where exposure to high particulate air concentrations is likely, or use of filtering respirator masks in such environments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory illnesses, through adherence to immunization schedules and good hand-hygiene practices</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hepatic manifestations</strong> &ndash; Due to risks for portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis, all patients require an annual assessment of liver size by physician examination and complete liver function testing including hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, and albumin levels annually. A baseline liver ultrasound should be obtained at the time of diagnosis and reassessed every three to five years. Doppler assessment of portal venous flow should be performed in patients with splenomegaly or with other clinical features that could indicate the presence of portal hypertension. Liver biopsy may be appropriate if significant abnormalities are identified by laboratory testing or imaging studies. Notably, patients receiving androgen therapy are at increased risk of developing hepatic dysfunction and should be monitored more closely. Preventative management focuses on avoidance of alcohol consumption and medications with known hepatic toxicities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endocrine manifestations</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Hormone deficiencies are not common in DC, and most assessments of hormone levels should be tailored to suspected deficiencies. Notably, patients who have undergone HCT and those are receiving androgen therapy should undergo annual assessment by an endocrinologist, due to the high risk of endocrine complications in patients with DC receiving these treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For all patients with DC, we recommend baseline assessments of thyroid hormone function, including a TSH level. Patients with short stature should have assessment of growth hormone axis function by an endocrinologist, although it should be noted that most patients with DC who have short stature do not have GH deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Patients with hypogonadism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pubertal delay should have an assessment by an endocrinologist for bone age, testosterone, LH, and FSH levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complications of poor bone <span class=\"nowrap\">health/osteopenia</span> are quite common in patients with DC, and we recommend annual screening of serum calcium, magnesium, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, with supplementation indicated for any deficiencies. Additionally, we recommend initial dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening beginning at age 14, with repeat assessments every three to five years depending on coexistent risk factors.

HCT using an unaffected matched sibling donor conveyed a significant survival advantage over receiving alternative donor HCT (92 to 58 percent), and performing HCT at age &lt;20 years may also convey a survival advantage.

The study involved a prospective series of 27 individuals ages 17 and older who had at least one cytopenia associated with a telomere disorder other than classic DC, diagnosed based on short telomere length or genetic testing. Danazol (400 mg) was administered twice daily for two years. The study was stopped early after the first 11 patients reached the two-year evaluation because the effect on the prespecified primary endpoint (20 percent reduction in telomere shortening) was much more dramatic than expected.

Hematologic responses were seen in 79 percent of patients at three months and 83 percent at 24 months.

If a pathogenic mutation has been identified, first degree family members (especially siblings) should be tested as soon as feasible, both to identify clinically occult disease and to determine their eligibility as a donor for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Prenatal testing is also possible if needed. (See <a href=\"#H669065662\" class=\"local\">'Initial and ongoing screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2961436041\" class=\"local\">'Screening of family members and relatives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusions may be required for severe anemia or thrombocytopenia in patients with BMF. We pursue HCT for all pediatric patients with DC who have BMF and meet eligibility criteria. However, this approach has many risks; it does not treat the extra-hematopoietic complications of DC, and it may increase the risk of non-hematologic malignancies.
