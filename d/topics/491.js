Different conditions affect different parts of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76735\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76735 \">figure 1</a>). The most common are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cataracts &ndash; A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glaucoma &ndash; Glaucoma is a disease that damages the main nerve in the eye, called the optic nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macular degeneration &ndash; Macular degeneration is a condition that damages the macula. The macula is part of the retina in the back of the eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic retinopathy &ndash; Diabetic retinopathy damages the retina, too. But in this case the damage is related to having blood sugar levels that are too high for many years. This type of vision loss affects people with diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presbyopia &ndash; Presbyopia occurs when the lens of the eye can no longer focus the right way on things that are close. Presbyopia occurs with aging in everyone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refractive errors &ndash; Refractive errors, such as nearsightedness and farsightedness, happen when the cornea (a structure in the front of the eye) cannot focus images onto the back of the eye the right way. Refractive errors can occur at any age.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28696438\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should be tested for age-related vision loss?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts recommend that people have at least 1 full eye exam (called a &quot;comprehensive eye exam&quot;) after they turn 40.</p><p>If you are 40 or older, you should be tested even if your vision is fine. That's because many eye conditions do not affect vision until they are very advanced. By then, it might be too late to protect your vision. But if you catch a problem early, you can sometimes prevent vision loss.</p><p>During the comprehensive eye exam, an eye doctor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Looks into the back of your eye with a magnifying tool to check for signs of nerve damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checks how well you see things in the center of focus and how well you see things that are off to the side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checks the pressure inside your eye by pushing or blowing on your eye with a special tool. People with glaucoma often have too much pressure inside the eye.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28696445\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments are available?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on the cause of vision loss. For instance, some people with cataracts might need surgery to replace the lens in their eye. People with glaucoma can take drops to lower the pressure inside their eyes. With some forms of vision loss, early treatment is very important because it can prevent further vision loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28696452\"><span class=\"h1\">Can age-related vision loss be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some types of age-related vision loss can be prevented. You can reduce your chances of developing vision loss by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not smoking (or quitting if you smoke)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping your blood sugar level as close to normal as possible if you have diabetes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing goggles or other types of eye protection when you use heavy machinery or do anything that could hurt your eyes</p><p/><p>There is also some evidence that eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in fat and cholesterol can help prevent vision loss in some people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28696459\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I already have age-related vision loss?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you already have vision loss, remember that there are tools that can help you make the most of the vision you have left. For instance, you can use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnifying devices that mount on the TV and other screens</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large print books</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computer programs that allow your computer to read aloud to you</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Braille &ndash; Braille is a form of language that uses raised dots. People who are blind read books and signs in braille by passing their fingers over these dots.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28696541\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataracts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cataracts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Open-angle glaucoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related macular degeneration (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetic retinopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=presbyopia-and-refractive-errors-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Presbyopia and refractive errors (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
