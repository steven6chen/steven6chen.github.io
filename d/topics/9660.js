Galactocerebrosidase is responsible for the liposomal hydrolysis of galactolipids formed during white matter myelination. The pathologic changes in the peripheral and central nervous system (globoid cell formation and decreased myelin) are hypothesized to result from the toxic nature of accumulated psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which cannot be degraded because of the galactocerebrosidase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Many aspects of the pathophysiology of Krabbe disease are unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The galactosylceramidase gene (GALC), also known as the galactocerebrosidase gene, is located on chromosome 14q31 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. More than 70 GALC mutations, including numerous small deletions and insertions, have been identified in patients with all clinical types of Krabbe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some mutations result in the infantile type if found homozygous or with another severe mutation, and one mutation predicts a less severe phenotype. However, genotype-phenotype correlations are not well established for Krabbe disease, with the exception of patients who are homozygotes for the most common deletion, or those who have other truncation, frameshift, or nonsense mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 30 kb deletion is particularly common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. This mutation makes up approximately 40 to 45 percent of the mutant alleles in infantile patients in northern Europe and is present in approximately 35 percent of the mutant alleles in infantile Mexican patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-half of patients with the juvenile or adult phenotype are heterozygous for the large 30 kb gene deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other mutations in these patients may occur in a low-activity GALC allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, a few reported patients with at least one copy of the 809G mutation have had a juvenile or adult phenotype, regardless of the mutation in the second allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent analysis of Krabbe genotypes found many of unknown significance and confirmed that predicting the timing of symptom onset, if any, is extremely difficult in most potentially at risk people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Obstacles to correlating genotypes with specific phenotypes include the rarity of many mutations and the need for very long follow-up of patients. As an example, in the eight-year experience of the New York State Krabbe Consortium, none of the infants who were homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for p.T96A or p.Y303C, two mutations previously associated with later onset symptoms, developed any Krabbe symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are no available data that can determine the risk that these individuals have for developing symptoms beyond their first decade of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3141055162\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of this disorder was originally estimated to be 1:100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Later, evidence from accumulation of around two million cases by the Krabbe Consortium of New York State indicated an incidence of 1:400,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A more accurate estimate of incidence in the United States was 1:250,000, as determined by analysis of death certificates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, as many as 1:6000 individuals may have decreased enzyme activity and genotypes of unclear significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The incidence for Krabbe disease is presumably that of the invariably fatal early infantile variant, most likely to be listed as a cause of death. The incidence of late-onset cases, which may have prolonged survival with more indolent symptoms, cannot yet be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with Krabbe disease present with symptoms within the first six months of life; approximately 10 percent present later in life, including adulthood. A peripheral motor sensory neuropathy occurs in all patients, but the early onset forms are dominated by symptoms related to central nervous system dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infantile onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms usually develop from ages two to five months with infantile onset Krabbe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Manifestations include irritability, developmental delay or regression, limb spasticity, axial hypotonia, absent reflexes, optic atrophy, and microcephaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Seizures eventually appear, and tonic extensor spasms occur upon stimulation with light, sound, or touch. These children regress rapidly to a decerebrate condition, with most dying before reaching two years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Juvenile onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with juvenile onset disease typically present with weakness, loss of skills, and vision loss. Late infantile and juvenile patients regress at an unpredictable rate, but all become severely incapacitated and die two to seven years after diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult onset disease may be manifested initially by loss of manual dexterity, burning paresthesias in the extremities, weakness, or peripheral motor sensory neuropathy with loss of distal sensation and muscle atrophy with scoliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Some adolescents and adults have symptoms confined to weakness without intellectual deterioration, whereas others become bedridden and continue to deteriorate mentally and physically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20035154\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with infantile-onset Krabbe disease, the most frequent MRI abnormalities involve the deep cerebral white matter, dentate nucleus, and cerebellar white matter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64081\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64081 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,16</a>]. In those with juvenile and adult onset Krabbe disease, brain MRI may show atrophy and increased T2 signal involving the parieto-occipital regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52319\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52319 \">image 2</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corticospinal tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71266\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71266 \">image 3</a>), while the dentate and cerebellum are generally spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. These observations are supported by the findings of a retrospective study that reviewed initial brain MRI findings from an international registry of Krabbe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. MRI abnormalities differed according to age of onset:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 39 subjects with early infantile (0 to 6 months) onset Krabbe disease, increased T2 signal intensity predominantly involved the periventricular cerebral white <span class=\"nowrap\">matter/centrum</span> semiovale, dentate hilum, and cerebellar white matter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 10 subjects with late infantile (7 to 12 months) onset, the most frequent abnormalities were increased T2 signal in periventricular cerebral white <span class=\"nowrap\">matter/centrum</span> semiovale, thalamus, and dentate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 11 subjects with onset from 1 to 10 years, the most frequent areas of increased T2 signal were the parieto-occipital region, posterior corpus callosum, and periventricular cerebral white <span class=\"nowrap\">matter/centrum</span> semiovale</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among four subjects with adolescent and adult (&gt;11 years) onset, three had increased T2 signal restricted to the corticospinal tracts</p><p/><p>Head CT scan most often shows increased signal in the basal ganglia or thalamus. In one report of symptomatic children with early infantile Krabbe disease, MRI scans were abnormal in 32 of 42 (76 percent), and CT scans of the brain were abnormal in 10 of 15 (67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurophysiologic studies are abnormal in a majority of children with infantile onset Krabbe disease. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) show marked slowing of both motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities in most patients with infantile onset, even in presymptomatic disease, and in 20 percent of those with late onset disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>In the largest published series of 27 children with Krabbe disease ranging in age from one day to eight years who were evaluated with electrodiagnostic studies, the following observations were made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve conduction studies were abnormal in 25 (93 percent). Abnormalities were found most frequently with sural sensory responses, F-wave latencies, motor conduction velocities, and distal motor latencies (82, 85, 82, and 76 percent, respectively). No conduction block was seen in any child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 24 children with the early infantile form, NCS were abnormal in 23 (96 percent), and marked NCS abnormalities were found in three neonates less than one month old; the youngest was one day old and asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among nine children with normal electroencephalography or evoked potential testing, NCS were abnormal in five (56 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of abnormalities on NCS testing correlated with clinical disease severity. These results suggest that the severity of NCS abnormalities may correlate with the degree of central nervous system involvement.</p><p/><p>Symptomatic children frequently have abnormalities on brainstem and visual evoked potentials as well as electroencephalography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20035262\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration is a characteristic but not universal feature of Krabbe disease, and is thought to occur because of the breakdown of myelin associated with the disorder. In a registry of 25 symptomatic children with early infantile Krabbe disease who had lumbar puncture, elevated CSF protein levels were present in 23 (92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20035255\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologically, peripheral nerve demyelination and periodic acid-Schiff-positive multinucleated globoid cells are present. Hypomyelination occurs in the early onset form and segmental demyelination in the late onset type. Electron microscopy shows curvilinear lamellar inclusions in Schwann cells and histiocytes. Pathologic findings in the central nervous system include globoid cells, generalized loss of myelin, and almost total loss of oligodendroglia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive diagnosis of Krabbe disease is made by measurement of galactocerebrosidase (GALC; also known as galactosylceramidase) activity in leukocytes isolated from whole blood or cultured skin fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Typical values in patients with Krabbe disease are &lt;5 percent of the normal value. Unfortunately, the residual activity is not an indicator of clinical type or prognosis.</p><p>In addition, molecular genetic testing is available to confirm the diagnosis of Krabbe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and is also useful for genetic counseling if parental genotypes are available, despite limited information about genotype-phenotype relationships. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Prenatal diagnosis for at-risk couples is performed by measuring GALC activity in a chorionic villi sample or cultured amniocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Prenatal diagnosis can also be achieved by molecular genetic analysis if both disease-causing mutations are known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>All siblings of confirmed Krabbe disease cases should be tested preferably during the prenatal period or in the immediate new born period for GALC activity, and also with molecular genetic testing if possible, particularly if the genetic profile of the proband is known. Older asymptomatic siblings who are galactocerebrosidase deficient should be observed closely, but these patients may not become symptomatic or require treatment because of heterogeneity.</p><p>Preliminary evidence indicates that psychosine may be elevated in the blood of symptomatic Krabbe disease patients. If this is confirmed prospectively in a sufficient number of patients, psychosine may emerge as a useful diagnostic test. (See <a href=\"#H4197941675\" class=\"local\">'Other biomarkers'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2886204685\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A method for newborn screening uses tandem mass spectrometry to directly assay galactocerebrosidase in dried blood spots for the detection of Krabbe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This screening technique is required in three US states (New York, Kentucky, and Missouri) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, the utility of screening is unknown because neither enzyme activity nor knowledge of the genetic mutation can reliably predict phenotype. In addition, the long-term benefit of umbilical cord blood transplantation is incompletely known. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>In an analysis of nearly 2 million newborns who were screened in New York from 2006 through 2014, the following observations were made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more known or potentially pathogenic GALC mutations were identified in 348 infants, who were referred for specialty care and confirmatory testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmatory testing by leukocyte GALC testing divided this group into infants at high risk (n = 14), moderate risk (n = 37), low risk (N = 92), and those considered not at risk (n = 203) for Krabbe disease; two infants were lost to follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 14 infants at high risk, the diagnosis of early infantile Krabbe disease was confirmed in five. Of these, four underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between 42 and 41 days of life. At last follow-up, three infants had died, two from complications of HSCT, and one from manifestations of untreated Krabbe disease. Of the two survivors who had HSCT, one was nonambulatory with severe global developmental delay, while the other required a wheelchair stander and had significant developmental delays in all domains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two infants who fit current criteria for transplantation were not treated because their parents declined the recommendation of physicians. Neither of these infants developed early infantile Krabbe disease; they would have been subjected unnecessarily to the risks of transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At last follow-up, the number of asymptomatic children considered at moderate or high risk for developing later-onset Krabbe disease was 46. Because of the risk of late-onset disease is not known in these children, they may need to be followed for decades.</p><p/><p>These results raise significant concerns about the utility and ethical basis of newborn screening for Krabbe disease, since the screening test has a high rate of false positive results and since there is no proven effective treatment. These problems could lead to harm (eg, anxiety and uncertainty) for families of asymptomatic children identified as having moderate or high risk for later onset of disease. These results also show the possibility of subjecting infants not destined to develop early disease to a treatment that has significant mortality. An editorial related to the published New York experience even called for abandonment of newborn screening for Krabbe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening#H104529374\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening&quot;, section on 'Criteria for screening program'</a>.)</p><p>Notwithstanding these gaps in knowledge and the disappointing outcomes of the New York program, newborn screening for Krabbe disease has been approved in several more states. Advocacy groups have argued before state legislatures that a treatment like hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which may slow progression and extend survival though not curative, is preferable to the inexorable progression and early death in untreated infantile cases of Krabbe disease. Since more infants consequently will be screened, and since some studies suggest that early treatment has the potential to improve outcomes (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below), strategies for rapid diagnosis are being examined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4197941675\"><span class=\"h2\">Other biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One significant barrier to rapid and accurate diagnosis is the high false positive rate for Krabbe newborn screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, the diagnostic tests described above, such as MRI, lumbar puncture, and electrodiagnostic examinations, are difficult to obtain in newborns and may not be rapidly available. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in determining whether early infantile Krabbe has a signature that may predict which patients will become symptomatic.</p><p>Psychosine (galactosylsphingosine) has emerged as one candidate for such a rapidly available, predictive biomarker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Working with our collaborators at Mayo Clinic and the New York State Department of Health, we have demonstrated that a statistical analysis of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme activity and blood psychosine might eliminate the false positive problem and provide accurate and early diagnosis, reducing the harm of treatment to one infant every 25 years in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, further prospective studies are needed to confirm whether testing for psychosine and GALC in this manner will become the standard for accurate newborn screening for Krabbe disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664891477\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of infantile Krabbe disease is broad and includes a number of neurodegenerative conditions that can present with neurodevelopmental delay and white matter abnormalities on neuroimaging studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65871\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65871 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/1,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28,29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alexander disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alexander-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alexander disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartoacylase deficiency (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspartoacylase deficiency (Canavan disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GM1 gangliosidoses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GM2 gangliosidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV encephalopathy (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome#H18840547\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric HIV infection: Classification, clinical manifestations, and outcome&quot;, section on 'HIV encephalopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metachromatic leukodystrophy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metachromatic-leukodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metachromatic leukodystrophy&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal hypoglycemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelizaeus-merzbacher-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sjogren-larsson-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson syndrome&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenoleukodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenoleukodystrophy&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zellweger spectrum disorder (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peroxisomal-disorders#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peroxisomal disorders&quot;, section on 'Zellweger syndrome'</a>)</p><p/><p>Distinguishing Krabbe disease from these disorders can be difficult, though a definitive diagnosis can usually be made based upon the results of targeted metabolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> molecular genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>].

In such cases, supportive care is the only viable option to manage irritability and spasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The available evidence, discussed in greater detail below, suggests but does not establish that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is beneficial for the infantile form of Krabbe if performed before the onset of symptoms, and is possibly beneficial for patients with juvenile onset Krabbe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preliminary studies have reported beneficial clinical effects using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat the infantile form of Krabbe. These include a reduction in symptom burden and cognitive decline, but only if transplantation is performed before the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, the benefit on survival, as opposed to symptom burden, is discernible in children treated after onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The treatment of Krabbe disease using hematopoietic stem cells has become a safer procedure with the development of techniques such as accurate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, depletion of donor T lymphocytes, and umbilical cord blood. However, the stem cell transplantation requires myelosuppressive therapy and is not without potential risk. Furthermore, long-term benefit for this intervention has not been established.</p><p>The following reports illustrate the range of findings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report published in 2005 examined the effect of umbilical cord blood transplantation from unrelated donors in 11 asymptomatic (ages 12 to 44 days) and 14 symptomatic newborns (ages 142 to 352 days) with infantile Krabbe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. All patients received myeloablative chemotherapy prior to transplantation. The following observations were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At a median follow-up of three years, all 11 children who had transplantation as <strong>asymptomatic</strong> newborns remained alive and demonstrated normal progression of central myelination by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In 10 of these children who had neurocognitive evaluations after transplantation, all had age-appropriate language, and nine had age-appropriate cognitive function. Of some concern, four had mild to moderate delay in gross motor function. These findings contrasted with the disease progression seen in an untreated control group of registry patients, most of whom experienced overwhelming spasticity, blindness, and death by one or two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Infantile onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At a median follow-up of 3.4 years, only 6 of 14 infants who were <strong>symptomatic</strong> at the time of transplantation had survived; the survival rate for this group was not considered statistically different from survival among the untreated controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. None of the surviving patients from the symptomatic group demonstrated appreciable improvement in any domain of neurocognitive function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2016 case-control study of updated information from our registry demonstrated a sustained, over two-fold improvement in survival probability for children who were transplanted (n = 16) compared with those who were not transplanted (n = 69), even if transplantation was done after symptoms became apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an early study, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed in five children with Krabbe disease (one with asymptomatic infantile type and four with late onset disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Engraftment occurred in all patients, and normal leukocyte galactocerebrosidase levels were restored. In the four patients with late onset disease, the CNS deterioration was reversed, whereas no signs or symptoms appeared in the patient with infantile onset disease. Brain MRI showed a decrease in signal intensity in three patients studied before and after transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may also improve peripheral nerve conduction abnormalities, especially if performed within the first month of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. But the diagnosis is very seldom made this early, unless a prior sibling has been affected.</p><p/><p>The advent of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for infantile Krabbe disease presents a therapeutic dilemma, since the procedure appears to provide maximal benefit only when performed in the presymptomatic stage. However, there is no reliable way to predict phenotype in early infantile Krabbe disease based upon low galactocerebrosidase activity or genotype, and some untreated children with low galactocerebrosidase activity and two genetic mutations in the New York State screening program have remained asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Early intervention with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in these cases would likely have been considered &quot;successful.&quot; Furthermore, there have not been any documented cures of symptomatic patients, and no additional studies have confirmed the initial transplant data. Therefore, we inform potential candidates and their families of the option of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, being careful to point out its uncertain benefit and potential risks.</p><p>Investigational treatments for Krabbe disease include oral agents that might serve as activators of residual enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/krabbe-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20034632\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC), also known as galactosylceramidase. The pathologic changes in the peripheral and central nervous system (globoid cell formation and decreased myelin) are hypothesized to result from the toxic nature of accumulated psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which cannot be degraded because of the GALC deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H20034641\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with Krabbe disease present with symptoms within the first six months of life; approximately 10 percent present later in life, including adulthood. A peripheral motor sensory neuropathy occurs in all patients, but the early onset forms are dominated by symptoms related to central nervous system dysfunction. Infantile onset disease is associated with irritability, developmental delay or regression, limb spasticity, axial hypotonia, absent reflexes, optic atrophy, and microcephaly. Seizures and tonic extensor spasms eventually appear. Typically there is rapid regression to a decerebrate condition and death in most cases before two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive diagnosis of Krabbe disease is made by measurement of GALC activity in leukocytes isolated from whole blood or cultured skin fibroblasts. Typical values in patients with Krabbe disease are &lt;5 percent of normal. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uniformly effective therapies are not yet available for patients with Krabbe disease. While preliminary evidence suggests that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is beneficial for the infantile form if performed before the onset of symptoms, there is currently no established way to predict phenotype before symptoms emerge in such infants, and some will have minimal or no symptoms without treatment. There is limited evidence that symptomatic children with the late onset (juvenile) form of Krabbe disease may benefit from transplantation even after the onset of symptoms.
