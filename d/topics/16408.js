In 1960, before the commercial availability of drugs for treatment of infertility, there were approximately 4.3 million births in the United States, with 1244 triplets and higher order multiples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 2011, the total number of births was slightly lower (3.9 million), but there were 5417 triplet and higher order multiples; these numbers do not include those high order multiple gestations (ie, pregnancies with at least three fetuses) reduced naturally or iatrogenically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of high order multiple births are naturally conceived, 39 to 67 percent are related to ovulation <span class=\"nowrap\">induction/superovulation,</span> and 13 to 44 percent are associated with ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Among women undergoing IVF with fresh nondonor embryos in 2009, the rates of singleton, twin, and triplets-or-more pregnancies were 61.7, 28.5, and 3.1 percent, respectively (6.7 percent undetermined at early miscarriage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. By comparison, in 2011, 3.5 percent of all live births in the United States were multiple gestations (twins 3.3 percent, triplets or more 0.14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The lack of insurance coverage for ART in most of the United States, as well as competition among ART programs, has generated pressure to achieve success in a minimal number of cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. One strategy has been to increase the number of embryos transferred per IVF procedure. An analysis of 1998 Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) data demonstrated that providers in states without insurance coverage for IVF transferred more embryos per cycle, had a higher percentage of cycles resulting in pregnancy, and encountered an increased frequency of high order gestations compared to providers in states with IVF insurance coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Infertility patients often consider the birth of twins acceptable, or even desirable, since it may result in a completed family after (sometimes) years of infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Nevertheless, there is a need for effective methods to reduce the frequency of multiple gestation, particularly high order pregnancies. Multiple gestations are at significantly increased risk of fetal, neonatal, and maternal complications, as well as complete pregnancy loss, when compared to singleton pregnancies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67721 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, in one review, the risk of delivery &lt;32 weeks of gestation for singleton, twin, triplet, and quadruplet pregnancies was 2, 8, 26, and &gt;95 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another study that compared twin pregnancy outcome with outcome of two successive singleton pregnancies delivered by the same mother, adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were significantly increased for IVF twins compared with two successive IVF singleton pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The economic and psychological impact on families raising children of a multiple gestation is also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In one study, for example, 22 percent of mothers of multiples had Parenting Stress Index scores indicating severe parenting stress, compared with 5 percent of mothers of IVF singletons and 9 percent of mothers of naturally conceived singletons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Another study found that each additional child more than tripled the odds of not being able to meet basic material needs and doubled the odds of a lowered quality of life for the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Some progress toward this goal has been made as a result of refinements in embryo evaluation and patient selection. High order pregnancy rates have fallen from a peak of 0.19 percent of all births in 1997 to 0.15 percent of all births in 2008, despite an increase in the number of procedures, but the twin birth has increased from 2.8 to 3.4 percent of all births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Several strategies attempting to control the frequency of high order multiples have been implemented, sometimes on a national scale. The overriding aim of these strategies is to transfer fewer embryos of higher quality to maximize the pregnancy rate and minimize the risk of high order multiple gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITING THE MULTIPLE GESTATION RISK OF ART</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restricting the number of embryos transferred during IVF increases the proportion of singleton births. National legislation in several European countries restricting the number of embryos transferred has proven to be effective in reducing the high order pregnancy rate, although there has been a trade-off in terms of lower delivery rates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71188 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Beginning i 1998 the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) issued practice guidelines on the number of embryos to transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and periodically revised the guidelines, most recently in 2017 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112844\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112844 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These guidelines suggest limiting the number of embryos transferred based upon maternal age and embryo quality, as assessed by the availability of embryos for cryopreservation.</p><p>The ASRM guidelines have had a significant impact on practice patterns and outcomes, resulting in a shift toward transfer of fewer embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The percentage of ART cycles in the US with transfer of one, two, three, or four or more embryos in 1996 versus 2009 was: one embryo 6 versus 13.5 percent, two embryos 10 versus 51.5 percent, three embryos 23 versus 23.4 percent, and four embryos 62 versus 7.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There are no legal regulations in the United States limiting the numbers of embryos transferred.</p><p>Although the rate of IVF pregnancies with twins has not changed significantly over time, the rate of triplets and higher order multiple gestations has decreased by approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. These data do not include rates of multifetal pregnancy reduction; thus, the contribution of pregnancy reduction to this decrease in high order multiple pregnancy is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94578635\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors affecting multiple gestation risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimum number of embryos to transfer depends on a number of factors, which are discussed below.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">/8558/58/558/558/</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies consistently demonstrate that live birth rates after ART decrease with advancing age. The importance of maternal age on the risk of multiple gestation after embryo transfer is illustrated by 2006 ART surveillance data reporting multiple birth rates after transfer of three or two embryos in women of various age groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59373 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Live birth rates and twin rates were comparable for all age groups whether three or two embryos were transferred, but transfer of two embryos resulted in substantial reductions in the incidence of high order multiple births, especially among younger women. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Embryo quality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to select only the highest quality embryos would allow transfer of fewer of them while achieving acceptable birth rates. Embryo quality is assessed in a number of ways, with morphological evaluation remaining the first-line method for assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, new approaches using growth factors and targeted biomarkers, such as amino acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], metabolomic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], proteomic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and genomic assays, may improve our ability to assess embryos in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Number of eggs fertilized</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of embryo quality was demonstrated in a study that found higher pregnancy rates when more than four eggs fertilized and two embryos were transferred than when only two eggs fertilized and two embryos were transferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Presumably fertilization of four eggs provided a higher chance of selecting quality embryos for transfer. In all maternal age groups up to age 40 years, when four eggs fertilized, the transfer of two, rather than three, embryos reduced the risk of high order birth without decreasing the chance of live birth.</p><p>Similarly, a CDC study of 35,554 IVF transfers showed that for all age groups, increased availability of embryo choice (indicated by the cryopreservation of at least one embryo) resulted in higher live birth rates despite fewer transferred embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morphological criteria associated with improved embryo quality are used to identify developmentally competent embryos for transfer. The human zygote should undergo the first cleavage division by 30 hours post-insemination, the second cleavage division by approximately 44 hours, and the third cleavage division to the 8-cell stage by 68 to 72 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55217 \">figure 1</a>). Embryos developing more slowly than described in this timeline are less likely to implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Determining a cumulative embryo score encompassing the three characteristics of cell number, fragmentation, and embryo symmetry can help to select the most viable embryos, thereby maintaining implantation rates while reducing the need to transfer many embryos and the concomitant risk of multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/28,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36</a>].</p><p>Additional morphologic criteria that have been developed for assessing embryo quality include fragment distribution among the blastomeres, morphology of the first polar body, pronuclear orientation, pronuclear morphology, time of initial cleavage, and mononucleate blastomeres [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/37-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-48</a>]. Independently, all of these characteristics have been found to enhance implantation and pregnancy rates when used to select embryos for transfer.</p><p>While numerous studies have evaluated the utility of multi-day embryo assessment for selection of embryos for day 3 transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], one study showed that day 2 or day 3 evaluations alone are sufficient for morphological assessment of cleavage stage embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Nevertheless, an embryo grading system incorporating characteristics from the pronucleate to the blastocyst stage may eventually be employed to select developmentally superior embryos for transfer on days 5 or 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Chromosomally normal and abnormal embryos have different developmental kinetics.&nbsp;Time-lapse morphokinetics analysis may increase the probability of selecting chromosomally normal embryos for transfer and thus allow transfer of fewer embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].&nbsp;However, to date, no studies show higher live birth rates. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Preimplantation genetic screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) has been used to test for aneuploidy, but does not improve live birth rates. The rationale for this procedure is that the ability to transfer chromosomally normal embryos should increase the overall success rate of ART. However, PGS is invasive and involves removing one or more cells from the embryo for testing. Injury to the embryo during biopsy and indeterminate genetic results may contribute to embryo loss. Data from randomized trials and prospective controlled studies have shown that PGS does not improve live birth rates in women of any age or in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, and may in fact lower them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]; there are also no data that it improves IVF success rates in women with repeated implantation failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

The additional 24 hours in culture from day 2 to day 3 allowed identification of embryos that arrested at the 4-cell stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55217 \">figure 1</a>). A general movement toward transferring human embryos on day 3 rather than on day 2 resulted in enhanced success rates with transfer of fewer embryos and, ultimately, fewer multiple gestations. Initially, however, there was a spike in high order multiple gestation after day 3 transfer was implemented because embryo transfer guidelines had not been revised to transfer fewer embryos to correct for better success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, it should be noted that some studies have reported that poor prognosis patients may benefit from transferring embryos on day 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Day 5 (blastocyst stage)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolic requirements of the human embryo demand changes in culture as the genome switches on at the 8-cell stage. The ability to serve these changing metabolic needs has permitted culture to day 5 and enabled identification of the most developmentally superior blastocysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55217 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. </p><p>There are both advantages and disadvantages to blastocyst culture and transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Transfer on day 5 is more natural as it takes about four days for the naturally fertilized egg (zygote) to travel through the fallopian tube and reach the uterine cavity. Blastocysts may be better embryos because they have demonstrated the ability to make the transition from maternal proteins to embryonic proteins and undergo cell differentiation to achieve the blastocyst stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Only one or two blastocysts need to be transferred to maintain overall success rates, while decreasing the high order multiple pregnancy rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/59,62-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,62-67</a>]. If only one or two blastocysts are transferred, triplet pregnancy should not occur unless one of the blastocysts divides to form monozygotic twins. In fact, however, the frequency of monozygotic twinning appears to be higher with blastocyst transfer than with cleavage stage transfer (OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.54-6.01; 1.64 versus 0.41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Some studies show up to 5 percent monochorionic twinning rates, with a further increase in risk if the embryos were formed following ICSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Additional concerns about the use of blastocysts include the possibilities of an altered sex ratio of births favoring males (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.1-1.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], epigenetic effects on the embryo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], and increased risk of preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. However, for ongoing pregnancies, most pregnancy outcomes are similar for day 5 versus day 3 transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].</p><p>Other drawbacks of blastocyst transfer include the potential for loss in extended culture of embryos that may have successfully implanted if transferred on day 3, and the potentially poorer long-term survival of embryos cryopreserved on day 5. This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing blastocyst and cleavage stage transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The live birth rate per randomized patient was significantly higher in patients who had a blastocyst stage transfer (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.76), and the multiple pregnancy rate was similar for both groups when an equal number of embryos was transferred, but the blastocyst stage group also had a higher cycle cancellation rate (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.47-3.32) and lower cryopreservation rate (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14-0.55) compared with the cleavage stage group. </p><p>Patients with no 8-cell embryos on day 3 have a significantly lower chance of conceiving after a day 5 transfer than after a day 3 transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. When cumulative day 3 pregnancy rates include the results of cryopreserved embryo cycles, there may be no advantage of day 5 transfer per controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in patients with good prognosis (defined as either first IVF cycle plus good embryo quality plus sufficient embryos for cryopreservation or previous IVF success). However, survival of cryopreserved blastocysts varies among centers, and can be quite good. In addition, if only patients with a good prognosis or donor egg cycles are selected, some retrospective studies (but not all) reported that prolonging embryo culture to day 5 improved embryo selection and implantation rates and achieved a significant decrease in high order gestations by reducing the number of embryos transferred, without compromising the pregnancy rates from the fresh transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/63,74-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,74-80</a>]. One could argue that there is no reason to transfer more than two embryos in these good prognosis patients, per SART guidelines. One [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>] of nine randomized trials comparing day 3 versus day 5 transfer reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/81-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-89</a>] and none of these trials showed an increase in high order multiple gestation in patients undergoing day 5 embryo transfer.</p><p>It may be prudent to restrict day 5 embryo transfer to younger patients (usually under age 40) with a number of good quality embryos (patient age cutoffs and the minimum number of good quality embryos will vary from center to center). One or two blastocysts are transferred based on the patient's age, embryo quality, and cycle history. This approach attempts to reduce the risk of high order multiple pregnancy without increasing cycle cancellation rates or decreasing implantation rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Single embryo transfer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective method of avoiding high order multiple pregnancy is single embryo transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/4,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,90</a>]. Elective single embryo transfer (eSET) is defined as transfer of one good quality embryo in cases in which at least two good quality embryos are available. Practice committees of the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine suggest that eSET is most appropriate for women with a good prognosis for conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &lt;35 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than one high quality embryo for transfer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First or second IVF treatment cycle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recipients of embryos from donated eggs</p><p/><p>Evidence for the efficacy of this approach was provided in a 2013 meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials of single versus double embryo transfer (DET); most of the trials compared cleavage stage transfers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The live birth rate after one cycle of DET was not significantly different from the rate after two cycles of SET (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.92-1.62, three studies, n = 811), thus for a woman with a 40 percent chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance of live birth following two SET cycles would be 30 to 42 percent. However, the multiple pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the DET group (OR 30.54, 95% CI 7.46-124.95, three RCTs, n = 811); therefore, for a woman with a 15 percent risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET, the risk of multiple pregnancy following two SET cycles would only be 0 to 2 percent. These data suggest that SET is superior to DET when the number of deliveries with at least one live born child, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and maternal and pediatric complications are taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. </p><p>Blastocyst transfer is associated with higher pregnancy rates and monozygotic twinning rates than cleavage stage embryos transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. In a randomized trial of blastocyst versus cleavage stage transfer, pregnancy rates were 32 and 21.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. All of the women in this trial were under 36 years of age; therefore, these results may not apply to older women, who comprise the majority of ART patients. It is also important to understand that when embryo quality is suboptimal at the cleavage stage, further development to the blastocyst stage is compromised. Blastocyst transfer is unwise in such cases and may actually result in no viable blastocysts to transfer; hence, in these cases, a cleavage stage transfer should be performed.</p><p>Utilization of eSET will likely increase as methods of predicting embryo viability improve and pressure to reduce high order pregnancy mounts. Preimplantation genetic screening is one such method that has shown some promising results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A randomized trial found that well-informed and supported patients were more likely to choose eSET than patients receiving usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. For women under 35 years of age for whom eSET is planned and who meet their center's criteria for day 5 embryo transfer, we suggest transferring a single day 5 blastocyst or high quality cleavage stage embryo. </p><p>Although eSET is associated with a higher rate of singleton pregnancy, the outcomes of these singleton pregnancies are less optimal than those of spontaneously conceived singleton pregnancies. In a systematic review of randomized trials and cohort studies that compared the outcome of eSET conceived singletons to spontaneously conceived singletons, eSET pregnancies were at higher risk of preterm birth (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.26-3.61), placenta previa (RR 6.02, 95% CI 2.79-13.01) and ectopic pregnancy (RR 6.40, 95% CI 4.38-9.35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Thus, ovulation induction and superovulation account for the largest proportion of high order multiple gestations. The contribution of ovulation induction to high order multiple births is rising, while the number of these births from IVF is falling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The number of large follicles present on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration is a key factor in determining the risk of multiple gestation in superovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. In one series of 4062 cycles, the incidence of high order multiple pregnancy by number of follicles of diameter &ge;10 mm was: 5 to 6 percent with four to six follicles, 14 percent with seven to eight follicles, and 19 percent with nine or more follicles present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Factors associated with the highest risk of high order multiple pregnancies included age &lt;32 years, having seven or more follicles of diameter &ge;10 mm, and an estradiol concentration &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (note: this value is assay-dependent). Interestingly, this study also showed that high order multiple pregnancy did not occur after the first cycle unless there were more than seven follicles, and did not occur after the second cycle regardless of follicle number, which suggests that gonadotropin dosing may be safely increased after the first cycle with close monitoring of follicle development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>In the first cycle, however, the dose of gonadotropin and length of stimulation are highly important factors.
