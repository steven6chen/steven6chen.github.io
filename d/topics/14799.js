These side effects are clinically important and can be distressing for patients. Furthermore, RT-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) can cause patients to delay or refuse further treatment.</p><p>The incidence, classification of risk, and management of RINV are discussed here. The approach to chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of radiotherapy (RT)-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) is incompletely understood but is thought to be similar to that caused by chemotherapy. Progress in understanding the pathophysiology of chemotherapy-induced emesis led to the development of agents that form the basis for treatment of RINV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and prediction of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two prospective observational studies provide information on the frequency of radiotherapy (RT)-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) and the extent to which this problem is treated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Italian Group for Antiemetic Research in Radiotherapy (IGARR) analyzed the incidence of RINV in 1020 patients receiving various kinds of RT with or without concomitant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Overall, nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting was reported by 28 percent. The median time to the first episode of vomiting was three days. Antiemetic drugs were administered to 17 percent of the patients, including 12 percent treated prophylactically and 5 percent given rescue therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 368 patients receiving RT with or without concomitant chemotherapy, the overall incidence rates for nausea and vomiting were 39 and 7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nausea was more frequent in those receiving RT to the lower abdomen or pelvis and to the head and neck area (66 and 48 percent, respectively). Importantly, only one-fourth of the patients reporting nausea felt that antiemetics had been beneficial, and one-third would have liked additional treatment.</p><p/><p>The importance of RINV is illustrated by its impact on quality of life (QOL). In an analysis of patients receiving abdominal RT, a patient's subjective experiences from RINV directly correlated with the worsening of QOL outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and severity of radiotherapy (RT)-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) depend upon details of the treatment (irradiated site and volume, single and total dose, fractionation schedule, techniques). Patient-related factors (gender, general health of the patient, age, concurrent or recent chemotherapy, psychological state, tumor stage, history of prior treatment-related nausea) are also important.</p><p>The most important factor appears to be the radiation field. The 2016 guidelines from the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), which have been subsequently endorsed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), divide the risk of emesis due to RT into four categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111053\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111053 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High &ndash; Total body irradiation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; Upper abdominal irradiation, craniospinal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low &ndash; Cranium (all), head and neck, thorax region, pelvis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal &ndash; Breast and extremities</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION AND TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are only limited data from randomized trials that have evaluated the efficacy of various antiemetic drugs in preventing radiotherapy (RT)-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82679\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82679 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73445 \">table 3</a>). Generally, these trials were conducted in patients at moderate or high risk for RINV. </p><p>The available evidence from these trials indicates that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are the most active agents that have been evaluated in randomized trials. However, other agents also have a role in some settings, especially in patients receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of antiemetic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">5-HT3 receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists were analyzed in a meta-analysis that included nine trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this meta-analysis, fewer patients had residual emesis compared with placebo (40 versus 57 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.57-0.86), and fewer required rescue medication (6.5 versus 36 percent, RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.60). Despite treatment, most patients did develop RT-induced nausea (70 versus 83 percent with placebo, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96). </p><p>The underlying incidence of nausea and vomiting in these trials is heavily influenced by the study populations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82679\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82679 \">table 2</a>). Taken together, these trials show that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have significantly greater protective effect against RINV for patients receiving upper abdomen irradiation than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, phenothiazines, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. Similarly, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists provided significantly better protection against RINV caused by total body irradiation or hemibody irradiation than conventional antiemetics or placebo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73445 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Separate analyses of trials comparing 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with metoclopramide also demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for the control of vomiting.</p><p>The adverse effects of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are generally mild, consisting mainly of headache, constipation, diarrhea, and asthenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/13,14,16,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,16,19,20</a>]. In some patients, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists reduced the frequency of diarrhea, a troublesome side effect due to acute radiation enterotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials in RINV have utilized five different 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=palonosetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">palonosetron</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=granisetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">granisetron</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolasetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolasetron</a>, tropisetron).

Although the risk of developing an abnormal heart rhythm with oral dolasetron is less than that seen with the injection form, precautions are indicated to avoid arrhythmias, even with the oral formulation.

One randomized trial showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> was significantly more effective than placebo in patients receiving RT to the upper abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Combining corticosteroids with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists was assessed in a trial in which a five-day course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> was compared with ondansetron plus placebo in 211 patients who received RT to the upper abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. During the first five days, there was a statistically nonsignificant trend toward complete control of nausea (50 versus 38 percent with placebo) and vomiting (78 versus 71 percent), which was the primary objective of the trial. The effects of dexamethasone extended beyond the initial five-day period, and significantly more patients had complete control of emesis over the entire course of radiotherapy (23 versus 12 percent with placebo), a secondary objective of the trial. Although this study did not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit for the primary endpoint, the results strongly suggest that the addition of dexamethasone was beneficial.</p><p>Since emesis is more frequent early in treatment, prophylactic antiemetics may not be necessary for a full course of RT, and treatment for the first week may be sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment/abstract/24,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists have an established role in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).
