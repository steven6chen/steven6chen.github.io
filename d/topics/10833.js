It is sometimes called Meniere's disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14147840\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes Meniere disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meniere disease is caused by a build-up of fluid in the inside of the ear. Doctors are not sure why the fluid builds up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14147855\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Meniere disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with Meniere disease have these 3 symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertigo &ndash; This is the medical term for when people feel dizzy and like they are spinning, swaying, or tilting. People with vertigo might also feel like the room is moving around them. Some people with vertigo feel sick to their stomach (nausea) and throw up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tinnitus &ndash; This is the medical term for when people hear a buzzing, ringing, or hissing noise in 1 or both ears. People with Meniere disease often say the noise sounds like listening to machinery or the inside of a seashell.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss &ndash; This symptom happens slowly, often over a period of 8 to 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14147870\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Meniere disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no test for Meniere, but there are tests for some of its symptoms. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have Meniere disease by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>You will probably be tested for hearing loss and might be tested for balance problems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balance testing &ndash; For one of these tests, you will have small devices called &quot;electrodes&quot; put near your eyes to measure your eye movements while you move your head and eyes. For other tests, you sit in a special chair that spins, or you stand on a platform that moves. Special devices measure how your body responds to the movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hearing test (also called &quot;audiometry&quot;)</p><p/><p>Your doctor might also do tests to make sure you do not have a different problem. These tests might include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to look for an infection or hormone problem, such as diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An MRI of the head &ndash; This is an imaging test that allows the doctor to see parts of your brain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14147885\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You might feel better if you avoid eating and drinking things that make your symptoms worse. These things can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salt and salty foods</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monosodium glutamate (also called &quot;MSG&quot;) &ndash; This is a substance sometimes added to certain foods (such as Chinese food and packaged foods) to make them taste better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coffee, tea, sodas, or other drinks that have caffeine in them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol</p><p/><p>You should also stop smoking, if you smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14147900\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Meniere disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat dizziness and nausea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to help with fluid or swelling in the ear</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hearing aid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special exercises to help with your balance &ndash; Your doctor might refer to you to a physical therapist (exercise expert) to teach you these exercises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that go into your ear &ndash; These are given as an injection (shot). Your doctor might recommend these if medicines taken in pill form do not work.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Your doctor might recommend surgery if your symptoms are so bad that you are not able to drive, work, or do active things you used to be able to do. But surgery might make your hearing worse.</p><p/><p>Some patients say that they feel better taking special vitamins or herbal treatments. But there are no studies that prove these treatments are helpful, and some might be costly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14147915\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertigo-a-type-of-dizziness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertigo (a type of dizziness) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dizziness-and-vertigo-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dizziness and vertigo (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
