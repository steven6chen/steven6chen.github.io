However, therapeutic advances have added to the armamentarium for treating this malignant process. As case-fatality rates decline, attention is increasingly turned to the management of long-term complications. One of these is the enduring risk of recurrent SAH, which can occur despite successful endovascular or surgical treatment of the ruptured aneurysm.</p><p>This topic discusses the risk of recurrent aneurysm formation and subarachnoid hemorrhage after a patient has been treated for an initial subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other topics address acute aspects of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, and aneurysm screening in other high risk populations.

The risk of SAH recurrence has been estimated to be 15 to 22 times higher than the expected rate of a first SAH in a healthy age, sex matched cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. </p><p>Independent risk factors for recurrent SAH in one study were current smoking, younger age, and multiple aneurysms at the time of the initial SAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Cigarette smoking and hypertension are also established risk factors for both unruptured intracranial aneurysms and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

In the ISAT, 10 of the 13 recurrent SAH from the original aneurysm were in the endovascular treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is consistent with follow-up imaging studies that suggest that aneurysm recurrence appears to be more common in patients who undergo endovascular treatment as opposed to surgical clipping:</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>In one case series, the index aneurysm was retreated during the first year in 8 percent of 299 patients treated with coiling and 2 percent of 711 patients treated surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. No surgically-clipped aneurysm was retreated after the first year, whereas 4.5 percent of endovascularly-treated patients required recoiling in the second year and 1 percent were recoiled each year in subsequent years.</li><li>Among the 2108 patients originally treated in ISAT, late retreatment was more frequent after endovascular coiling than after clipping (8.6 versus 0.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mean time to late retreatment after endovascular coiling was 21 months. </li><li>In a retrospective analysis of 501 aneurysms treated with endovascular coiling in 466 patients, 34 percent of aneurysms had recurrences at a mean of 12 months after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </li><li>A systematic review of published case series reported on aneurysm reopening after coiling in 8161 aneurysms: 91 percent were occluded after the first treatment; reopening occurred in 21 percent and retreatment was performed in 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </li><li>A single center&rsquo;s experience with coiling 818 patients with aneurysm, 404 of whom had presented with SAH, revealed recanalization rate of 20.9 percent on follow-up angiography performed between 6 to 18 months after the initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</li><li>In a systematic review of 71 studies of endovascular treatment of 1316 unruptured aneurysms followed for up to three years, recurrence was noted in 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</li></ul></p><p>The above studies suggest that aneurysm recurrence occurs in 9 to 34 percent of endovascularly-treated aneurysms. Risk factors for aneurysm recurrence reported in more than one study included larger lumen size (&gt;10 mm), larger aneurysm neck size, and incomplete occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/7-11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11,13-15</a>]. The mechanism of aneurysm recurrence in this setting may be related to compaction of coils over time <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to aneurysm sac growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One randomized trial found that the use of hydrogel-coated coils (designed to improve packing and stability) was associated with fewer cases of aneurysm recurrence compared to standard bare platinum coils (24 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The highest risk for recurrence of a coiled aneurysm appears to be in the first six months and is low after two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/3,15,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15,18,19</a>]. Most of these aneurysm recurrences are not associated with rupture and SAH; the estimated annual hemorrhage rate after coiling of a ruptured aneurysm is between 0.1 and 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/3,9,11-13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,11-13,18</a>]. </p><p>Recurrence of an aneurysm that was successfully surgically clipped appears to be relatively rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/1-3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,20</a>]. In a study of 112 patients (140 clipped aneurysms) who had agreed to undergo cerebral angiography at a mean of nine years after clipping, 4 aneurysm regrowths (3 percent) were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another study of 610 patients, treated with surgical clipping, follow-up computed tomographic angiography (CTA) 2 to 18 years after the index SAH revealed an aneurysm at the clip site in 24 patients (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Recurrent SAH attributed to a previously clipped aneurysm is even less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/1-3,18,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,18,20,22</a>]. As an example, in a cohort of 752 patients with aneurysmal SAH and successful clipping after a mean follow-up of 8 years, only 4 of the 18 subsequent recurrent SAH (0.5 percent) were associated with a recurrent aneurysm at the clip site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another series of 711 patients, none of the surgically clipped aneurysms was associated with rerupture over a mean of 4.4 years followup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5414444\"><span class=\"h2\">De novo aneurysm formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of de novo aneurysms after surgical clipping or endovascular coiling is uncertain, in part because aneurysms may be missed at the time of initial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. As an example, CTA was used to screen 495 patients who had had prior surgical clipping of a ruptured aneurysm at a mean 8 years previously (range 4 to 14 years). In 87 patients (18 percent), at least one aneurysm was found at a different location than the clip site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Of these 87 patients, the original digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or CTA was available for 51 patients (with 62 aneurysms on follow-up study). Comparison of the original and screening studies revealed that 19 of 62 aneurysms (31 percent) were de novo, and 43 (69 percent) were visible in retrospect. Other cohort studies also find that a significant percentage of &ldquo;new&rdquo; aneurysms are present on the original angiogram, when it is available for expert review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/2,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22</a>]. </p><p>De novo aneurysm formation probably occurs at a low rate; in one case series the five-year cumulative incidence after aneurysm coiling was 0.75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other studies have reported annual incidence of de novo aneurysm formation of 0.3 to 1.8 percent in patients who have had one aneurysm treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/6,21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21,25,26</a>]. Multiple aneurysms, smoking, and female gender have been associated with de novo aneurysm formation in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22024921\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth of pre-existing aneurysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 percent of patients with aneurysmal SAH have multiple aneurysms. Depending on their size, location, and other factors, these may be treated at the same time as the index (ruptured) aneurysm. However, smaller unruptured aneurysms and those less accessible to treatment may be observed rather than repaired. </p><p>In one study, serial imaging studies were used to follow 87 patients with 111 unruptured aneurysms; 79 patients had ruptured aneurysms clipped at start of followup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Unruptured aneurysms increased in size by &ge;1 mm in 45 percent of patients and by &ge;3 mm in 36 percent. Cigarette smoking was a risk factor for &ge;3 mm aneurysm growth. Other follow-up studies in patients after SAH have also documented a significant rate of aneurysm growth in untreated aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Recurrent SAH occurred in 1.6 percent of patients per year and was significantly predicted by aneurysm growth. Additional risk factors for aneurysm growth are larger aneurysm size, multiple additional aneurysms, and female gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5414645\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus on whether and how to screen for new or recurrent aneurysms after SAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>At least two decision models have been used to evaluate the utility of follow-up imaging studies:</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>In the first study, outcomes after SAH were modeled using expected outcome and complications rates obtained from a literature review. It was assumed that patients had successful obliteration of all aneurysms by surgical clipping or endovascular coiling after the index SAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients were screened with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). The expected quality-adjusted life years was virtually the same (about 8.3 years) for no screening, screening once at five years, and screening every two years, regardless of the initial type of treatment. Screening prevented new episodes of SAH, but the benefit was offset by the cost of increased morbidity from diagnostic tests and preventive treatment. As an example, with screening every two years after coiling, the expected rate of SAH decreased from 1.9 to 0.5 percent and mortality decreased from 0.9 to 0.6 percent, but the disability rate increased from 0.5 to 1.9 percent due to complications from angiography and retreatment.</li><li>In a second study, 610 patients with SAH were screened with CTA 2 to 18 years after surgical clipping, and the results of screening were used as input for a decision analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Screening every five years (compared with no screening) prevented nearly half of the SAH recurrences, but life expectancy increased only marginally, and these benefits were offset by a negative impact on quality of life and by increased costs. Screening became cost-effective but did not increase quality of life in patients when the risks of aneurysm formation and rupture were doubled, and screening was cost-effective and improved quality of life in patients with a 4.5-fold increase in both risks. In addition, screening increased quality of life at acceptable costs in patients with fear for a recurrence.</li></ul></p><p>In the face of limited and conflicting data, it is our opinion that patients require comprehensive follow-up after SAH. Extra vigilance is warranted for patients with risk factors for recurrent SAH and aneurysm regrowth, such as incomplete occlusion at initial treatment, large aneurysm size, multiple aneurysms, hypertension, and cigarette smoking.</p><p>For patients treated with endovascular coiling, we obtain immediate evaluation of the coil mass by angiography during the procedure. Plain skull films typically provide excellent coil visualization and are obtained immediately post procedure. Plain skull film screening is also obtained at two weeks, three months, and six months post-procedure. If the plain skull films reveal evidence of aneurysmal recanalization such as coil compaction, loosening, or reorientation, DSA is obtained. In addition, we recommend DSA at three to six months for all patients who have undergone coiling, as angiography remains the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although some data suggest that magnetic resonance angiography may be sufficiently accurate for this purpose, it is probably to some extent center-specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>For patients treated with surgical clipping of aneurysms, we obtain screening with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CTA at three and six months. Additional angiography is performed only if there are worrisome features on the noninvasive studies.</p><p>Further follow-up imaging studies depend on the appearance and size of the treated and any other aneurysms, the presence of risk factors for aneurysm recurrence, and the patient&rsquo;s functional status and individual preferences.</p><p>It should be noted that coil artifacts may interfere with interpretation of CTA in patients treated with coiling, whereas MRA interpretation may be impaired by large artifacts around clipped aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Therefore, CTA is preferred for assessment of patients with clipped aneurysms, and MRA is preferred for patients with coiled aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In one study of 60 patients with 74 coiled aneurysms followed with both angiography and MRA, agreement between the two studies was good. In only 4 aneurysms was recanalization seen on DSA that was not seen on MRA with the degree of angiographic recanalization in these patients considered too minor (&lt;3 mm) to indicate further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5415147\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of a recurrent, previously-treated aneurysm may involve either endovascular coiling or surgical clipping depending on the aneurysm morphology and may not be the same as the initial approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. Retreatment is not benign. In one case series, 11 percent of recoiling procedures were associated with potentially life-threatening or disabling events, while 2 of 12 repeated surgical procedures resulted in death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other treatment options for recurrent aneurysm after endovascular treatment include a recoiling procedure with placement of a covered stent in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Surgery can be used to treat a recurrent or incompletely occluded aneurysm after coiling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrence-of-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-and-intracranial-aneurysms/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>A decision to treat de novo aneurysms or enlarging pre-existing aneurysms uses the same considerations employed for other unruptured aneurysms.
