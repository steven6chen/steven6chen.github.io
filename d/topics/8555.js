However, the fall in the serum phosphate concentration may not become prominent until 12 to 36 hours after admission. This sequence is due to underlying chronic phosphate depletion, complicated by acute shifts of phosphate into the intracellular compartment. (See <a href=\"#H13459332\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below.)</p><p>The causes and treatment of hypophosphatemia in the alcoholic patient will be reviewed here. The major causes of hypophosphatemia; the clinical manifestations of hypophosphatemia, most of which are due to intracellular phosphate depletion; and the diagnosis and treatment of hypophosphatemia in the general population are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Signs and symptoms of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13459332\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypophosphatemia can result from reduced intestinal phosphate absorption <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased phosphate excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71616 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Both mechanisms may be operative in patients who abuse alcohol:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased intestinal phosphate absorption can result from poor dietary intake of both phosphate and vitamin D; binding of dietary phosphate by antacids given to treat recurring gastritis (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>); <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduced net intestinal phosphate absorption, which may be induced by chronic diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypophosphatemia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypophosphatemia&quot;, section on 'Decreased intestinal absorption'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased urinary phosphate excretion due to reduced proximal phosphate reabsorption can result from secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by vitamin D deficiency; therefore, 25(OH)D levels should be measured in alcoholic patients exhibiting hypophosphatemia. Alternatively, alcohol may directly promote urinary phosphate wasting by causing generalized proximal tubule dysfunction, which results in reduced phosphate reabsorptive capacity in the nephron. This proximal tubule dysfunction typically improves within days of abstinence from alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The physiology of phosphate handling within the nephron is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypophosphatemia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypophosphatemia&quot;, section on 'Increased urinary excretion'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In addition, chronic alcoholism can induce cellular phosphate depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is clinically important since the clinical manifestations of hypophosphatemia are thought to be largely due to cellular phosphate depletion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia#H16063123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Signs and symptoms of hypophosphatemia&quot;, section on 'Other effects of phosphate depletion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H324348475\"><span class=\"h2\">After hospital admission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although phosphate depletion is common in alcoholic patients admitted to the hospital, the fall in the serum phosphate concentration, occasionally to less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> may not become prominent until 12 to 36 hours after admission due to movement of extracellular phosphate into the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypophosphatemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypophosphatemia&quot;, section on 'Internal redistribution'</a>.)</p><p>Two factors may contribute to this shift:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholic patients usually receive intravenous therapy with dextrose-containing solutions. Glucose stimulates insulin release, which promotes phosphate uptake by the cells as phosphorylated glucose intermediates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If dextrose-containing infusions are avoided or discontinued, a shift of extracellular phosphate into cells may still occur due to refeeding-induced insulin release.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory alkalosis may result from alcohol withdrawal or other causes of hyperventilation. The elevation in extracellular pH produces a similar pH change within the cells since carbon dioxide can rapidly diffuse across cell membranes. The ensuing intracellular alkalosis stimulates intracellular phosphofructokinase, leading to an increase in glycolysis and movement of phosphate into cells.</p><p/><p>Thus, serial monitoring of the serum phosphate concentration is warranted when alcoholic patients are admitted to the hospital.</p><p>Hypophosphatemic alcoholic patients may have a myopathy due to both phosphate depletion and alcohol and are at risk for clinically significant rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The release of intracellular phosphate from damaged muscle cells may be one reason why two potentially fatal sequelae of hypophosphatemia &ndash; respiratory failure and severe central nervous system dysfunction &ndash; are rarely seen in alcoholic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Signs and symptoms of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis#H25326295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;, section on 'Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to phosphate repletion takes into account the serum phosphate concentration, the presence or absence of overt symptoms of hypophosphatemia, and whether or not the patient can take oral therapy. If possible, we prefer oral rather than intravenous phosphate therapy since intravenous repletion can lead to hyperphosphatemia that may result in serious complications such as hypocalcemia, acute kidney injury, and arrhythmias.

This dose is lower than that given to patients with hypophosphatemia due to renal phosphate wasting in whom raising the serum phosphate will increase phosphate excretion, thereby limiting the increase in serum phosphate. If present, a defect in proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption is usually mild in alcoholic patients and begins to reverse soon after admission to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
