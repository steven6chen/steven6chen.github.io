The epidemiology of child abuse, including risk factors in the perpetrators, victims, and environment, is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H1199045830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Soft-tissue injuries are the most common injuries identified in physical abuse and are present in as many as 92 percent of victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fractures are the second most common injury and are present in as many as 55 percent of physically abused children, depending upon the type of abuse and the method of fracture detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Most inflicted fractures occur during infancy and early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], with as many as 85 percent occurring in children younger than three years, and 69 percent in children younger than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]. The estimated annual incidence of fractures attributable to abuse is 36 cases per 100,000 children younger than 12 months, and 5 cases per 100,000 children between 12 and 35 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Data from the Kids' Inpatient Database (discharge data on 80 percent of acute pediatric hospitalizations in the United States) for 1997, 2000, and 2003 indicate that child abuse accounts for approximately 12 percent of fracture-related hospitalizations in children younger than 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The proportion of fracture hospitalizations attributed to abuse decreased with increasing age (25 percent for children &lt;12 months of age, 7 percent for children 12 to 23 months of age, and 3 percent for children 24 to 35 months of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a retrospective review of 258 patient visits with abusive fractures, 20 percent had at least one previous physician encounter for the fracture at which the possibility of abuse was not raised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In the largest study of inflicted fractures (429 fractures in 189 children), the median age was seven months (range &lt;1 month to 13 years); 69 percent of the patients were younger than one year of age, 17 percent were between one and two years of age, and 14 percent were older than two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Suspicion is raised when there are inconsistencies between the mechanism of injury described by the parent or caregiver and the child's injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109401 \">table 1</a>).

The diagnosis of abusive fractures may be facilitated by including a detailed review of the fracture mechanism and having a low threshold for performing a skeletal survey, consultation with a pediatric radiologist or pediatric orthopedist who has experience in the imaging of child abuse, and consultation with child protective services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The risks to the family and to the child must be weighed carefully in the decision to make a report to CPS. Serious consequences may occur for the family and child if the report is unsubstantiated. However, the potential consequences for the child of unreported child abuse include life-threatening injury and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. </p><p>The medical evaluation of suspected child abuse includes: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete history, and physical examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation of the interactions between the parents and child </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographs and laboratory tests as indicated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information from the child's primary care provider about past history, injuries, medical problems, immunization status, and frequency of health maintenance visits</p><p/><p>These aspects of the evaluation are discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children who have pathologic bone disease (eg, children with chronic renal disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, rickets) may sustain fractures from seemingly trivial incidents. These children also may be more likely to be abused or neglected than children without chronic medical problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The following discussion presumes that the child has a normal skeletal system.

It may be necessary to ask specific questions as the interview progresses (eg, if the mechanism of injury is a fall down the stairs, it is important to know how many steps, what the steps are made of, and whether or not they are carpeted). It is also important to ask about the initial position of the child, the dynamics of the fall, and the final position and location of the child relative to the steps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Aspects of the history that increase the level of suspicion for inflicted injuries include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inconsistencies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discrepancies in caretakers' accounts of the circumstances surrounding the injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unwitnessed injuries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries attributed to the patient's siblings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries inconsistent with the child's developmental stage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries inconsistent with the mechanism of injury offered</p><p/><p>For example, children who have inflicted musculoskeletal injuries are often said to have fallen from a piece of furniture.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-falls-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of falls in children&quot;, section on 'Furniture'</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should also carefully assess the child&rsquo;s past medical history, family history, and social history to identify other factors associated with abuse as well as risk factors for conditions associated with bone fragility.

When the injuries are unintentional, the radiologic evaluation may provide an alternative explanation (eg, osteopenia, skeletal dysplasia). On the other hand, when the injuries have been inflicted, the radiologic evaluation may identify the extent of injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthogonal radiographs (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral) should be obtained of all areas of bone tenderness, swelling, deformity, or limited range of motion, and all areas that have a history or evidence of previous trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. All radiographs should be reviewed by a pediatric radiologist who has experience in the imaging of child abuse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Skeletal survey</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Radiology, the AAP Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect , and the American College of Radiology, the skeletal survey is &quot;the method of choice for global skeletal imaging in cases of suspected child abuse&quot; and is mandatory for all children younger than two years of age in whom child abuse is suspected &#160; Skeletal survey usually is not necessary in verbal, ambulatory children older than five years of age, but it may be recommended in children with intellectual disability (mental retardation) or who are otherwise unable to give a history or indicate areas of trauma or pain. Children between the ages of two and five years must be evaluated on an individual basis, and localized radiographs or skeletal survey may be warranted based upon clinical indications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Skeletal survey'</a>.) </p><p>The standard skeletal survey includes AP and lateral views of the skull and chest; oblique views of the ribs; lateral views of the spine; AP views of the pelvis, long bones of the extremities, and feet; and posteroanterior oblique views of the hands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82510\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82510 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/27,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29-32</a>]. All radiographs should be reviewed by a radiologist who has experience in the imaging of child abuse. All of these views are necessary if occult fractures of abuse are to be detected. Proper positioning of the child and radiographic penetration are essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Abbreviated skeletal surveys, or studies that image the entire infant or young child with one or two radiographic exposures (eg, &quot;babygrams&quot;), have <strong>no</strong> role in the evaluation of suspected child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33</a>]. The importance of the skeletal survey in children undergoing evaluation for physical abuse is demonstrated by an observational study of 703 children; 11 percent had abnormalities, primarily fractures, and the highest frequency of positive surveys was seen in infants under six months of age and in infants and children with an apparent life-threatening event, seizure, or suspected abusive head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Of the 76 patients with positive skeletal surveys, the results of the survey directly led to the diagnosis of abuse in 50 percent of cases. </p><p>Especially in children who do not have head CT with 3D reconstruction of bone windows, bilateral lateral skull films and the Towne&rsquo;s view may increase sensitivity for Wormian bones, which are more commonly seen among children with certain types of osteogenesis imperfecta and other metabolic bone disease. These views are <strong>not</strong> part of a standard skeletal survey. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.) </p><p>A repeat skeletal survey taken two weeks after the initial evaluation may increase the diagnostic yield and is recommended in cases in which the suspicion of child abuse is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/27,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,35,36</a>]. The second study may demonstrate fractures that were not apparent initially and permit more precise determination of the age of individual injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50629 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/27,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,37,38</a>]. On the other hand, a repeat study that is unchanged from the initial evaluation may suggest an explanation other than fracture for the original abnormalities (eg, normal anatomic variant, bone dysplasia), and may lower the suspicion of abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Fracture age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians may be asked to determine the age of fractures diagnosed by skeletal survey.

However, initial radiographs are still necessary in all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. One advantage of Fluorine-18 NaF PET against follow-up skeletal survey is that it can be obtained immediately, which is especially useful when results may determine whether a child will be removed from the home, and when follow-up cannot be assured. </p><p>However, the availability of a PET scan and the necessary isotope (Fluorine-18 NaF) may be limited and sedation is required for performance of the study. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Radionuclide scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radionuclide bone scanning, or bone scintigraphy, has been recommended by some authorities as an alternative to skeletal survey for the initial evaluation of possible fractures and as a complementary study by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>]. The use of this study as the initial evaluation has both advantages and disadvantages.

A burst fracture with formation of a hematoma or retropulsion of a bone fragment may lead to immediate paraplegia or delayed symptoms of spinal cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>].</p><p>High-velocity hyperflexion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperextension, as in violent shaking of an infant or small child, may produce a variety of fracture-dislocations of the posterior elements of the spinal column. They usually involve the cervical spine, cervico-thoracic, or thoraco-lumbar junctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/105,107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,107,108</a>]. The hangman's fracture (fracture-dislocation of C2) is a classic example of a hyperextension injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Compression fractures and notching of the anterior surfaces of the vertebral bodies (caused by disruption of the vertebral end plates and resulting bone loss) also can be produced by this mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Fracture/avulsions</span> of the cartilaginous processes of the posterior spinous processes result from traction and shearing forces on the interspinous ligament during shaking; they usually are not seen acutely because of the lack of visualization of cartilage on plain radiographs. These injuries become visible as ossification of the avulsed cartilage progresses during the healing process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/4,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,107</a>].</p><p>Presenting signs and symptoms of spinal injury may be entirely absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>] or may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated irritability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slight abnormality of tone or posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tender spinal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/105,106,108,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106,108,112</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute or subacute onset of paraplegia or quadriplegia with urinary retention, loss of anal tone, and loss of bulbocavernosus reflex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple other fractures that may be visualized on skeletal survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/108,110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,110,111</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Skull fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skull fractures are frequently seen in abused children. Linear, parietal skull fractures are the most common type of skull injury following both unintentional and inflicted trauma. Complicated skull fractures (ie, complex [eg, stellate, branching], multiple, bilateral, crossing suture lines, depressed, or diastatic) are suggestive of abusive head trauma, but also occur following unintentional injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Skull fractures'</a>.) </p><p>Given the potentially similar features of accidental and inflicted skull fractures, these injuries should be evaluated in the context of the history that is provided by the child's caregiver(s). Abusive injury should be suspected if the history is inconsistent with the physical examination findings. If the mechanism of injury is a fall, it is important to determine the height of the fall and the type of surface of impact (eg, concrete, wood, carpet). In general, falls from two feet or less are unlikely to produce head injuries more serious than linear skull fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Skull fractures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Medical evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-falls-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of falls in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Other fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the sternum, scapula, and pelvis are suspicious for child abuse if they occur in the absence of a plausible history of high-energy injury, such as a motor vehicle accident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/3,5,10,26,113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,10,26,113,114</a>].</p><p>In addition, fractures of the hands and feet, particularly in nonambulatory children, should raise the suspicion of child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/48,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,115</a>]. It may be necessary to obtain oblique or high-detail, coned-down radiographs to detect these subtle lesions, which typically include torus fractures of the metacarpals and metatarsals, and buckle fractures of the proximal phalanges (from forced hyperextension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79186\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79186 \">image 1</a>), old or in various stages of healing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50629 \">table 4</a>), are highly suggestive of child abuse in the absence of a metabolic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/4,7,65,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,65,116</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-orthopedic-manifestations-of-child-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the orthopedic manifestations of child abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple fractures are found in approximately 80 percent of abused children younger than one year of age, and more than 50 percent of all abused children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/3,84,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,84,117</a>].

It usually occurs in association with fracture, but may be seen in the absence of fracture if there is subperiosteal hemorrhage (eg, after the application of a gripping, twisting, or shaking force) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/43,61,66,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,61,66,118</a>]. It can also present as a feature of osteomyelitis or Caffey&rsquo;s Disease. In one study of 429 fractures in 189 abused children, eight patients (4 percent) had traumatic periosteal reaction without fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Periosteal reaction may not be apparent clinically. It is only apparent on radiographs as the new bone is calcified (eg, 10 to 14 days after the injury) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50629 \">table 4</a>). Nuclear bone scan or repeat radiographs may be indicated if suspicion of fracture is high and no fracture is seen on initial films [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>]. In addition, a bone scan may show areas of increased radionuclide uptake at sites of subperiosteal hemorrhage even when the radiographs are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Ultrasonography is also particularly useful in demonstrating subclinical periosteal reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The rare exceptions are some physeal and intraarticular fractures, which require operative reduction and fixation. Since child abuse victims are usually young, healing is rapid, the potential for remodeling is great, and the prognosis is good.</p><p>Soft-tissue injuries (bruises, lacerations, burns) that are to be covered by a cast or splint should be photographed before treatment begins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In some states, parental permission must be obtained before photographs may be taken. The management of child abuse is discussed separately.
