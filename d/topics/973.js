Some of the endocrine abnormalities in AN represent physiologic adaptive responses to chronic starvation and serve to shunt limited resources to the most essential physiologic processes. Others are present even after weight recovery, suggesting a potential role in disease pathophysiology or lagging recovery of endocrine dysregulation. Some contribute to the development of low bone density, one of the serious endocrine consequences of AN. In addition to bone loss, other important endocrine consequences of AN include amenorrhea (and as a result, anovulatory infertility) and hyper- or hyponatremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84997290\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AN affects multiple hypothalamic-pituitary axes, which results in abnormal levels of several hormones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691218406\"><span class=\"h3\">Reproductive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with amenorrhea, estradiol deficiency, and infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-endocrine-complications-and-their-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Although it is possible for amenorrheic women to conceive by inducing ovulation using gonadotropins, the presence of active AN is considered to be a contraindication to ovulation induction, given the increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-endocrine-complications-and-their-management/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

We suggest a baseline measurement with periodic follow-up in females who are persistently low weight.</p><p>Assessment of other risk factors for osteopenia, such as reproductive and family history, smoking, excessive alcohol use, and use of medications affecting bone metabolism, should be assessed. Evaluation for other contributors such as celiac disease or hyperparathyroidism, particularly in women with severe bone loss, should be considered.

Exercise regimens must be individualized. While weightbearing exercise is generally beneficial to bone, over-exercise in these women can perpetuate weight loss and amenorrhea, thereby leading to bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-endocrine-complications-and-their-management/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In addition, women with severe bone loss are at risk for exercise-related stress fractures.

In this trial, women were randomized to one of four treatment groups: (1) rhIGF-1 (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> subcutaneous twice daily, adjusted to serum <span class=\"nowrap\">IGF-1)/placebo;</span> (2) oral contraceptive <span class=\"nowrap\">pill/placebo;</span> (3) <span class=\"nowrap\">rhIGF-1/oral</span> contraceptive pill; (4) <span class=\"nowrap\">placebo/placebo</span>. BMD at the spine increased in those who received rhIGF-I. The greatest gains were seen in those who received rhIGF-1 with oral contraceptive pills, suggesting that a combined approach may be beneficial. Consistent with prior studies, there was no increase in BMD in those who received oral contraceptive pills without IGF-1. As noted, rhIGF-1 is not currently available and is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for treatment of AN-associated bone loss, and the safety and efficacy of this approach needs further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691222628\"><span class=\"h3\">Bisphosphonates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that bisphosphonates may be of benefit in women with AN-associated bone loss; this has not been demonstrated in adolescents, and there are safety concerns for both groups. Most importantly, bisphosphonates should not be prescribed in patients in whom pregnancy could occur. If bisphosphonates are prescribed to females of reproductive age, a negative pregnancy test is advised prior to starting therapy, and contraception is recommended even in women with amenorrhea.</p><p>A 12-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> in 77 women with AN and osteopenia or osteoporosis demonstrated improvements in BMD of 3 percent at the posterior-anterior spine, 4 percent at the lateral spine, and 2 percent at the hip compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-endocrine-complications-and-their-management/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In contrast, transdermal testosterone replacement, which was also studied in this trial, did not improve BMD in these women.</p><p>Bisphosphonates are not approved in the United States for this indication and have not been shown to be effective or safe in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-endocrine-complications-and-their-management/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 21 women with AN, mean age 47 years old, six months of teriparatide (20 mcg subcutaneously) resulted in marked increases in BMD at the posteroanterior (6 versus 0.2 percent for placebo) and lateral (10.5 versus -0.6 percent for placebo) spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-endocrine-complications-and-their-management/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

AN is associated with significant medical complications, including endocrine dysfunction, and the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. (See <a href=\"#H84997283\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the endocrine abnormalities in AN represent physiologic adaptive responses to chronic starvation and serve to shunt limited resources to the most essential physiologic processes. Others are present even after weight recovery, suggesting a potential role in disease pathophysiology or lagging recovery of endocrine dysregulation. Some contribute to the development of low bone mineral density (BMD), one of the serious endocrine consequences of AN.
