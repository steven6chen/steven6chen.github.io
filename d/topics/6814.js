In many cases, the differential diagnosis is wide, ranging from benign to life-threatening conditions. Causes include medical, surgical, intraabdominal, and extraabdominal ailments. Associated symptoms often lack specificity and atypical presentations of common diseases are frequent, further complicating matters.</p><p>The elderly, the immunocompromised, and women of childbearing age pose special diagnostic challenges. Elderly and diabetic patients often have vague, nonspecific complaints and atypical presentations of potentially life-threatening conditions leading to time consuming workups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The immunocompromised patient may suffer from a wide range of ailments, including unusual and therapy-related conditions. Pregnancy leads to physiologic and anatomic changes affecting the presentation of common diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute abdominal pain in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss how to assess the adult patient presenting to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain, and provide a synopsis of important diagnoses to consider. Detailed discussions of specific diagnoses are found separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain comprises 5 to 10 percent of emergency department (ED) visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Despite sophisticated diagnostic modalities, undifferentiated abdominal pain remains the diagnosis for approximately 25 percent of patients discharged from the ED and between 35 and 41 percent for those admitted to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-9</a>]. Approximately 80 percent of patients discharged with undifferentiated abdominal pain improve or become pain-free within two weeks of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Older patients with abdominal pain have a six- to eightfold increase in mortality compared to younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. The elderly (ie, patients over 65 years of age) account for 20 percent of ED visits, of which 3 to 4 percent are for abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>]. About one-half to two-thirds of these patients requires hospitalization, while one-third requires surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/2,5,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,12-14</a>]. Some studies suggest the elderly sustain increased mortality when their diagnosis is not determined in the ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The incidence of abdominal pain in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient population ranges from 12 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Of HIV positive patients presenting with abdominal pain, 38 percent require admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Eleven percent of HIV positive patients requiring surgery had an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) associated opportunistic infection. The remaining patients had pathology commonly seen in the immunocompetent population. The most common diagnosis in this group was undifferentiated abdominal pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate life-threatening conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain may be caused by the following life-threatening conditions, which are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal aortic aneurysm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesenteric ischemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perforation of gastrointestinal tract (including peptic ulcer, bowel, esophagus, or appendix)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute bowel obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volvulus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ectopic pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental abruption</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial infarction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic rupture (eg, secondary to Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], leukemia, trauma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) &ndash; An aneurysm is a focal aortic dilation of at least 50 percent compared to normal, with any measurement greater than 3 cm considered abnormal. Most AAAs remain quiescent until rupture, but some manifest as abdominal, back, or flank pain. Aneurysm rupture typically causes exsanguinating hemorrhage and profound, unstable hypotension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number of atypical presentations exist for ruptured AAA, contributing to a misdiagnosis rate of up to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. AAAs can rupture into the retroperitoneum where they may tamponade, enabling the patient to remain normotensive initially. AAAs can present with back pain and hematuria leading to potential misdiagnosis as nephrolithiasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">AAA is most common in men over 60 years, with risk increasing dramatically as patients age beyond 60. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, smoking, and a family history are associated with AAA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesenteric ischemia &ndash; Mesenteric ischemia can be differentiated into four entities: arterial embolism (50 percent), arterial thrombosis (15 percent), nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (20 percent), and venous thrombosis (15 percent). Mesenteric ischemia is associated with high mortality and prompt diagnosis is crucial albeit often difficult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Acute mesenteric ischemia is classically said to present with rapid onset of severe periumbilical abdominal pain, often out of proportion to findings on physical examination. Nausea and vomiting are common. Sudden pain associated with few abdominal signs and forceful bowel evacuation in a patient with risk factors should greatly heighten suspicion for the diagnosis. The subset of patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis has a more indolent course and lower reported mortality. Risk factors include advanced age, atherosclerosis, low cardiac output states, cardiac arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), severe cardiac valvular disease, recent myocardial infarction, and intraabdominal malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal perforation &ndash; Many causes of gastrointestinal perforation exist, but peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is the most common. Perforation can also complicate appendicitis, diverticulitis, ischemic bowel, and toxic megacolon. Ulcer perforation should be suspected in patients with a history of peptic ulcer symptoms who develop the sudden onset of severe, diffuse abdominal pain. A detailed assessment reveals a history of PUD or ulcer symptoms in the majority of cases, a notable exception being older individuals with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced perforation. Perforation is more common and lethal among the elderly. Delays in diagnosis greater than 24 hours substantially increase mortality. Esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome), which can occur with severe retching, can present with severe and progressive epigastric abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease#H4460621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;, section on 'Perforation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute bowel obstruction &ndash; The majority of bowel obstructions involve the small intestine. Mortality from bowel strangulation varies from 8 percent when surgery is performed within 36 hours to 25 percent when surgery is delayed beyond 36 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H372577787\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of management of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications for surgical exploration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common symptoms of small bowel obstruction (SBO) are abdominal distention, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain, and absence of flatus. In proximal obstruction, nausea and vomiting can be relatively severe compared with distal obstruction, but distention of the abdomen is somewhat less. The colon requires 12 to 24 hours to empty after the onset of bowel obstruction so flatus and even passage of feces may continue after the onset of symptoms. Abdominal pain is frequently described as periumbilical and crampy, with paroxysms of pain occurring every four or five minutes. Pain progresses from crampy to constant and more severe, and some clinicians feel that such progression is a sign of impending strangulation. Focal abdominal pain in the presence of other symptoms of obstruction may be an ominous sign and should not be ignored.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Previous upper or lower abdominal surgery increases the risk for obstruction. Causes of SBO include: adhesions (50 to 70 percent), incarcerated hernias (15 percent), and neoplasms (15 percent). Gallstone ileus is the cause in up to 20 percent of cases among elderly patients. Patients with Crohn's disease frequently present with obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volvulus &ndash; The majority of patients with cecal volvulus have a similar presentation to those with small bowel obstruction. Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and obstipation. The pain is usually steady, with a superimposed colicky component. The abdomen is often diffusely distended. Fever, peritonitis, or hypotension may indicate the presence of intestinal gangrene. Risk factors for cecal volvulus include adhesions, recent surgery, congenital bands, and prolonged constipation. Mortality for cecal volvulus ranges from 12 to 17 percent; mortality in the elderly can be as high as 65 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cecal-volvulus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cecal volvulus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sigmoid volvulus accounts for the majority of volvulus cases. Most patients present with abdominal pain, nausea, abdominal distension, and constipation; vomiting is less common. Younger patients may have a more insidious presentation with recurrent attacks of abdominal pain and intermittent resolution, presumably due to spontaneous detorsion. Compromise of the blood supply to the sigmoid colon can lead to gangrene with resulting peritonitis and sepsis. Pain is usually continuous and severe, with a superimposed colicky component. The abdomen is usually distended and tympanitic. Risk factors include excessive use of laxatives, tranquilizers, anticholinergic medications, ganglionic blocking agents, and medications for Parkinsonism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sigmoid-volvulus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sigmoid volvulus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ectopic pregnancy &ndash; Clinicians must consider the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in any female of childbearing age with abdominal pain and should obtain a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test in all such patients. Risk factors include a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, previous tubal pregnancy, previous tubal surgery, history of endometriosis, and an indwelling intrauterine device. Although symptoms of ectopic pregnancy classically include the triad of amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and vaginal bleeding, up to 30 percent of patients do not have vaginal bleeding. The pelvic examination is often nondiagnostic; transvaginal ultrasonography, or serial testing of hCG, is performed to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with vaginal bleeding in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental abruption &ndash; An acute, clinical abruption classically presents with vaginal bleeding, abdominal or back pain, and uterine contractions. The uterus may be rigid and tender. The amount of vaginal bleeding correlates poorly with the degree of placental separation and in some cases may even be absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the presence of a severe abruption (&ge;50 percent placental separation), both fetus and mother may be at risk, and acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with vaginal bleeding in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In approximately 10 to 20 percent of cases, a woman with placental abruption will present with preterm labor only and no vaginal bleeding. Therefore, even small amounts of vaginal bleeding in the setting of abdominal pain and uterine contractions should prompt careful maternal and fetal evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Maternal hypertension is the most common cause of abruption, occurring in 44 percent of cases. Other risk factors include cocaine use, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, trauma, and advanced maternal age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial infarction &ndash; Atypical presentations of myocardial infarction are most common in women older than 65 years of age. Abdominal pain is the presenting complaint for an acute myocardial infarction in approximately one-third of atypical cases. Patients with diabetes may also present atypically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of coronary heart disease in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Common conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appendicitis &ndash; The early symptoms and signs of appendicitis are often subtle and nonspecific, and the examination unrevealing. Nausea and vomiting are generally not the first symptoms. Classically, patients initially experience anorexia along with vague periumbilical discomfort that develops into marked right lower quadrant pain. This progression occurs with an inflamed anterior or pelvic appendix. However, a retrocecal appendix may not cause focal signs of peritonitis. A pelvic appendix can present with urinary symptoms or diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who have had an appendectomy may still develop a stump appendicitis in which the appendix remnant becomes occluded, edematous, and infected. Presentation, diagnoses, and treatment are similar to that of appendicitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians often fail to diagnose appendicitis in elderly patients, in whom mortality can reach 70 percent. The elderly often present without the findings classically associated with appendicitis. Appendicitis is the most common extrauterine cause for abdominal surgery in pregnant women. The right lower quadrant is the most common location of pain regardless of gestational age, despite traditional teaching that the appendix migrates into the right upper quadrant during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary disease &ndash; Patients with acute cholecystitis typically complain of abdominal pain, most commonly in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. The pain may radiate to the right shoulder or back. Pain is often steady and severe. Associated complaints may include nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. There is often a history of fatty food ingestion about one hour or more before the onset of pain. Patients are usually ill appearing, febrile, and tachycardic, with tenderness in the right upper abdomen. Murphy's sign may be present, although the sensitivity of the test can be diminished in the elderly. Progression to septic shock can occur with ascending cholangitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatitis &ndash; Acute pancreatitis almost always presents with acute upper abdominal pain. The pain is steady and may be in the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant, diffuse, or, infrequently, confined to the left side. Band-like radiation to the back is common. Pain often reaches maximum intensity within 10 to 20 minutes of onset, but can persist for days. Nausea and vomiting is common. In severe cases, patients can present in shock or coma. Physical findings vary with severity. In mild disease, the epigastrium may be minimally tender; in severe episodes, upper abdominal distention, tenderness, and guarding are common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Predisposing factors include alcoholism, biliary tract disease, trauma, penetrating ulcer, infection, hypertriglyceridemia, drug reactions (eg, NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, thiazides, sulfonamides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, corticosteroids, estrogens), hypercalcemia, carbon monoxide exposure, and hypothermia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diverticular disease &ndash; The presentation of diverticulitis depends upon the severity of inflammation and the presence of complications. Left lower quadrant pain is the most common complaint. Pain is often present for several days prior to presentation. Many patients have had one or more similar past episodes. Nausea and vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a change in bowel habits often accompany the pain. Examination usually reveals abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Elderly patients are at increased risk for developing diverticula and their complications, which can include diverticulitis, perforation, obstruction, and hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-diverticulitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute diverticulitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-colonic-diverticulitis-medical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute colonic diverticulitis: Medical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peptic ulcer disease &ndash; Epigastric pain, indigestion, and reflux symptoms are classically associated with peptic ulcer disease (PUD), but none is sensitive or specific. In the absence of complications, examination findings are unremarkable. Complications include bleeding and perforation. Mortality from perforation is significantly higher in the geriatric population, particularly when the diagnosis is delayed 24 hours or longer. The elderly are often unaware they have PUD until a severe complication develops. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Immediate life-threatening conditions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incarcerated hernia &ndash; Inguinal hernias are most common and often present with mild lower abdominal discomfort exacerbated by straining. Inguinal and incisional hernias are more common in elder patients. Incarcerated hernias can cause severe pain and require immediate surgical consultation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroenteritis and other infectious causes &ndash; Although common, gastroenteritis is a diagnosis of exclusion in the ED, where the clinician must focus on life-threatening causes of abdominal pain. Infectious gastroenteritis, enteritis, and colitis have many etiologies (viral, bacterial, parasitic, antibiotic associated). Fever, diarrhea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting may be more prominent symptoms than abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute viral gastroenteritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foodborne disease &ndash; Foodborne diseases typically manifest as a mixture of nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Vomiting or diarrhea may be more prominent than abdominal pain. Depending upon the nature of the illness, symptoms can develop anywhere from one hour to several days after the contaminated food is ingested. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings#H1823851406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Clinical clues to the microbial cause'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of bariatric (weight loss) surgery &ndash; Complications can occur within weeks or years after bariatric surgery, and many involve abdominal pain as part of the presentation. In addition to such standard complications as bleeding and bowel obstruction, other potential complications (organized by procedure) include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: Gastric remnant distension; stomal stenosis; marginal ulceration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastric banding: Stomal obstruction; port infection; band erosion; band movement causing obstruction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sleeve gastrectomy: Gastric outlet obstruction; gastric leaks (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory bowel disease &ndash; Acute complications from inflammatory bowel disease can include pain, bleeding, perforation, bowel obstruction, fistula and abscess formation, and toxic megacolon.

Splenic rupture is a common example, but delayed presentations of perforated bowel, pancreatitis, and injuries to the liver, gallbladder, and genitourinary tract have all been reported. Diaphragmatic injury can even be delayed for months to even years and is often difficult to diagnose as the diaphragm is not well visualized by CT scan. Therefore, it is important to ask patients presenting to the ED with abdominal pain about recent and past trauma. Bedside ultrasonography may reveal intraperitoneal free fluid; CT imaging is often necessary in stable patients to make a definitive diagnosis. Immediate surgical consultation is needed for unstable patients in whom abdominal pain is suspected to be trauma-related. The initial evaluation and management of trauma is discussed separately.

When trying to determine the etiology of a patient's abdominal pain it is important to consider the patient's age, sex, past medical and surgical history, and medications, and to characterize the pain as precisely as possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68577\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68577 \">table 2</a>).

The risk for certain diseases, such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), mesenteric ischemia, atypical presentations of myocardial infarction, and colon cancer increases significantly in patients older than 50 years. The clinician must remember that older patients often present with different symptoms and signs than younger patients and take medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, that mask classic symptoms and signs. As an example, older patients diagnosed surgically with cholecystitis presented far more often with nausea or vomiting than pain, and among those over 65 years, 84 percent had neither epigastric nor right upper quadrant pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

As an example, a history of cardiovascular or peripheral vascular disease corresponds with an increased risk for mesenteric ischemia and AAA. A history of atrial fibrillation or heart failure places patients at risk for mesenteric ischemia from emboli or low-flow respectively. A history of HIV predisposes to opportunistic infection or a medication-related complication (eg, pancreatitis or renal colic). Previous surgery increases the risk for bowel obstruction. A history of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use predisposes to peptic ulceration and bleeding. Concurrent antibiotic or steroid use may mask infections, while some antibiotics increase the risk for Clostridium difficile colitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The social history can be of great importance. Alcohol abuse places patients at risk for pancreatitis, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Abdominal pain and nausea often figure prominently among the symptoms of patients withdrawing from opioids. Smokers have a greater risk of bladder and other cancers that may cause abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Occupational exposures to toxins or chemicals, recent travel, or similar symptoms among family or friends may be important clues indicative of a nonsurgical cause of pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PAIN DESCRIPTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain can be divided into three types: visceral, parietal (or somatic), and referred. The neurologic basis of abdominal pain is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology of abdominal pain'</a>.)</p><p>Visceral pain fibers originate in the walls of hollow organs and the capsules of solid organs and enter the spinal cord bilaterally at multiple levels. Thus, stimulation of visceral nerves produces a dull, poorly localized pain felt in the midline. Pain is perceived in the abdominal region corresponding to the diseased organ's embryonic origin. Visceral pain from structures that originated from the foregut (stomach, pancreas, liver and gallbladder, and proximal duodenum) manifests in the epigastrium; visceral pain from structures of the midgut (remainder of duodenum, small bowel, proximal large bowel) manifests in the periumbilical region; and visceral pain from structures of the hindgut (middle and distal large bowel, pelvic genitourinary organs) manifests in the suprapubic region. Ischemia, inflammation, or distention of hollow organs or capsular stretching of solid organs produces visceral type pain.</p><p>Parietal pain stimuli are transmitted to specific dorsal root ganglia on the same side and dermatomal level as the origin of the pain. Therefore the pain is more distinct (usually sharper) and localized. Ischemia, inflammation, or stretching of the parietal peritoneum produces parietal pain.</p><p>Referred pain is felt at a site far from the diseased organ (eg, gallbladder disease experienced as pain in the right subscapular area, a perforated duodenal ulcer causing shoulder pain secondary to diaphragmatic irritation). Shared central pathways for afferent neurons from different locations cause this phenomenon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Characterization of pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate characterization of abdominal pain includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset (eg, sudden, gradual)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provocative and palliating factors (eg, does pain decrease after eating?)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality (eg, dull, sharp, colicky, waxing and waning)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation (eg, to the shoulder, back, flank, groin, or chest)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Site (eg, a particular quadrant or diffuse)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms associated with pain (eg, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stool, vaginal discharge, painful urination, shortness of breath)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time course (eg, hours versus weeks, constant or intermittent)</p><p/><p>A table summarizing high-risk features of abdominal pain is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68577\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68577 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Location may help to narrow the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70233 \">table 3</a>). Pain from abdominal viscera often localizes according to the structure's embryologic origin, with foregut structures (mouth to proximal half of duodenum) presenting with upper abdominal pain, midgut structures (distal half of duodenum to middle of the transverse colon) presenting with periumbilical pain, and hind gut structures (remainder of colon and rectum, pelvic genitourinary organs) presenting with lower abdominal pain.</p><p>Right upper quadrant pain is often associated with the liver or gallbladder, although pain from biliary colic may be poorly localized and patients may complain of lower chest, epigastric, or back discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Other causes of right upper quadrant pain include myocardial infarction, right lower lobe pneumonia, and right-sided pulmonary embolus (PE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Left upper quadrant pain can be from pancreatitis, gastric disease, or splenic enlargement. Other causes include left lower lobe pneumonia and myocardial infarction. Both appendicitis and ectopic pregnancy may present with right lower quadrant pain. Diverticulitis usually presents with left lower quadrant pain.</p><p>However, clinicians should <strong>not</strong> base the differential diagnosis solely upon the location of pain; diagnosis and pain location often do not correspond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As an example, the diagnosis of appendicitis in patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain may be missed if the clinician fails to consider that retrocecal appendicitis can present in this manner. One study looking at patterns of abdominal pain found that only 60 to 70 percent of patients would be correctly diagnosed based on &quot;typical&quot; exam findings alone, yielding a misdiagnosis rate of 30 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Pain location may change over time, reflecting progression of disease. As a classic example, the pain of appendicitis may begin as periumbilical (reflecting its embryologic origin), but move to the right lower quadrant as the inflamed appendix irritates the peritoneum. Another example would be the changing location of pain associated with an extending aortic dissection. Radiation of pain may aid diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61375 \">figure 1</a>). As examples, pain from pancreatitis may radiate to the back while pain from gallbladder disease may radiate to the right shoulder or subscapular region.</p><p>Pain acuity, duration, and intensity can provide clues to disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/3,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31,32</a>]. Pain with maximum intensity at onset is concerning for abdominal or extraabdominal vascular emergencies (eg, aortic rupture or dissection, mesenteric ischemia, PE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The sudden onset of significant pain often reflects a serious underlying disorder, such as organ perforation or ischemia (eg, acute mesentery artery occlusion, ovarian torsion), or obstruction of a small tubular structure (eg, biliary tract or ureter). A more gradual onset of symptoms suggests an inflammatory or infectious process (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis), or obstruction of a large tubular structure (eg, bowel). Severe pain of sudden onset and constant or worsening pain lasting over six hours (but less than 48 hours) suggest a surgical cause. Nonsurgical causes tend to be less painful. </p><p>Aggravating and alleviating factors are important. The pain of peptic ulcer disease may improve after meals, whereas biliary colic worsens after meals. Pancreatitis pain may improve when the patient sits upright and increase when the patient reclines. Patients with peritonitis lie still and coughing can worsen their pain, whereas the patient with nephrolithiasis is restless and cannot find a comfortable position. Ask the patient whether going over bumps during the drive to the hospital caused pain. A positive response suggests peritonitis and is roughly 80 percent sensitive, but only 52 percent specific, for appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The character of the abdominal pain is often linked to a specific diagnosis. Burning pain is associated with an ulcer, tearing pain with aortic dissection, and colicky or crampy pain with distention or stretching of a hollow tube, such as with kidney stones in the ureter. Sharp pain develops when inflammation or noxious stimuli (eg, blood, stomach acid, bowel contents) contact parietal peritoneum.</p><p>Associated symptoms can help narrow the diagnosis, especially with extraabdominal causes. Inquire about fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain, since pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction can all present with abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Though vomiting and nausea are nonspecific, the order of these symptoms may provide a clue to the diagnosis. If vomiting occurs after the onset of pain, the pain is more likely to stem from a surgical process, such as bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Vomiting from relatively benign causes is usually self-limited. The type of vomiting may suggest a diagnosis. Bilious vomiting may be caused by an obstruction distal to the duodenum. Causes of coffee-ground or hematemesis include peptic ulcer disease, varices, and, in patients with a history of aortic aneurysm repair, aortoenteric fistula. Diarrhea is often associated with an infectious cause or diverticulitis, but can occur with mesenteric ischemia, in which case it may be bloody, or possibly bowel obstruction. </p><p>Associated genitourinary symptoms can be important. In women, inquire about vaginal bleeding or discharge and recent changes in menstruation; in men, inquire about penile discharge and scrotal pain or swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with vaginal bleeding in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Keep in mind that the presentation and characteristics of abdominal pain may be dramatically different in elder patients despite the presence of a life-threatening condition. As an example, a perforated ulcer may present without the sudden onset of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Begin the physical examination by assessing the vital signs. Though fever increases the suspicion for infection, there are certain patient populations, such as the elderly and the immunocompromised, that may be unable to mount a fever. Elderly patients with an intraabdominal infection are four times more likely than younger patients to present with hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An oral temperature may be affected by respiratory rate, which is often elevated in those with pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. If there is concern about an inaccurate reading, check a rectal temperature. An elevated respiratory rate may itself be a compensatory reaction and should alert the clinician to the possibility of underlying metabolic acidosis. &#160;</p><p>Next, inspect the patient. While requiring only a few seconds, inspection can provide many clues to the diagnosis. The patient who is restless, curled up, and agitated may suggest renal colic, while a patient lying perfectly still in bed with knees bent raises concern for peritonitis. Inspection may reveal signs of previous surgeries (eg, midline incision scar), abdominal pulsations, or signs of systemic disease (eg, pallor in shock, spider angiomata in cirrhosis), which can be especially important in those who are unable to provide a history.</p><p>On auscultation, listen for bowel sounds for two minutes. Bowel sounds are normally heard as two to twelve medium-pitched gurgles per minute. The absence of bowel sounds over two minutes suggests peritonitis. Hyperactive medium-pitched bowel sounds are associated with blood or inflammation within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Periodic rushes of high-pitched &quot;tinkling&quot; bowel sounds or the complete absence of bowel sounds, in the presence of abdominal distention, suggests bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A bruit may be heard in the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).</p><p>Palpation of the abdomen enables the clinician to identify the location and degree of tenderness and to detect signs of peritoneal irritation, such as involuntary guarding and rigidity. One approach is to initially perform light palpation in the area away from the site of pain. Palpation can then be extended in either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation towards the area of maximal pain. Once the area of maximal tenderness is localized, maneuvers to elicit somatic signs can be performed. If a specific area of tenderness is not identified with light palpation, deeper palpation can be performed to identify other abnormalities such as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, aortic dilatation, or signs of a retrocecal appendix. &#160;</p><p>The few studies that have looked at traditional techniques for assessing rebound tenderness suggest that these tests have limited sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Gentler methods to elicit signs of peritoneal irritation include having the patient cough or drop their heels to the ground after standing on their toes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The heel test can also be performed by striking a recumbent patient's heel. Studies of these tests are limited and their characteristics remain uncertain. Nevertheless, a rigid abdomen is cause for concern. </p><p>In patients older than 50 years, it is worthwhile and safe to attempt to palpate the aorta. To do so, have the patient lie supine with their feet on the stretcher and knees bent, thereby relaxing the abdominal wall musculature. Abnormal width of the aortic pulsation suggests the diagnosis of AAA. Depending upon the patient&rsquo;s body habitus and their aortic anatomy, the accuracy of the physical examination for detecting an AAA may be limited, but it can provide important information. </p><p>Other examination findings to note include Carnett's sign, Murphy's sign, obturator sign, psoas sign, and Rovsing's sign. In Carnett's sign, there is increased tenderness when the abdominal wall muscles are contracted. Tenderness exacerbated by muscular contraction is more likely to be due to pathology within the abdominal wall. In one small study, Carnett's sign was found to be 95 percent accurate at distinguishing abdominal wall pain from visceral pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Although insensitive, the psoas, obturator, and Rovsing signs have good specificity for acute appendicitis. A positive psoas sign consists of pain elicited when the examiner passively extends the right hip of the patient, who lies on their left side. A positive psoas sign may be seen with a retrocecal appendix. A patient with a pelvic appendix may have a positive obturator sign. Pain elicited when the clinician performs passive internal rotation of the flexed right thigh represents a positive test. Rovsing's sign consists of pain in the right lower quadrant elicited by palpation of the left lower quadrant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis#H5346477\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Murphy's sign occurs when a patient abruptly stops a deep inspiration during palpation of the right upper quadrant. This test can be useful in some patients with suspected cholecystitis, but its sensitivity may be diminished in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. </p><p>Perform testicular examinations in men and pelvic examinations in females with pain in the lower half of the abdomen. No preexamination criteria exist that enable the clinician to determine if the pelvic examination will provide useful information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pain from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may not be localized to the suprapubic region. The rectal examination may reveal a mass or gastrointestinal bleeding, but its usefulness in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain and no gastrointestinal bleeding has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

Abdominal tenderness may not localize because of changes in the nervous system affecting pain perception. Rebound or guarding may not be present because of lax abdominal wall musculature. In one retrospective study looking at elderly in-patients with peritonitis, only 34 percent manifested guarding or rebound tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Physical examination can be difficult during pregnancy. Pregnant patients may have fewer clinical findings and may not demonstrate peritoneal signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This may be a result of the gradual growth and stretching of the peritoneal cavity, which desensitizes the pregnant patient to peritoneal irritation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute abdominal pain in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;, section on 'General approach'</a>.)</p><p>Many extraabdominal causes of abdominal pain exist and the clinician should not neglect other parts of the physical examination. Auscultate the heart and lungs. Atrial fibrillation noted on physical exam may increase suspicion for mesenteric ischemia. Localized decreased breath sounds or coarse breath sounds may raise suspicion for pneumonia. Palpate the chest wall, spine, and pelvis. Pain at the costovertebral angles may suggest pyelonephritis. Assess hip range of motion as infectious and inflammatory processes can refer pain to the lower abdomen.</p><p>The skin exam is important and often overlooked. This is especially true in the elderly, who have a higher incidence of herpes zoster. Ecchymosis of the abdomen (Cullen's sign) or flank (Grey Turner's sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F95719\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95719 \">image 1</a>)) suggests intraabdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, possibly caused by a ruptured or leaking AAA or hemorrhagic pancreatitis. The skin may be cool and damp in patients with shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>In a patient with equivocal signs and symptoms, serial examinations can improve diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should not rely on ancillary studies to make a diagnosis but should use them as adjuncts. In one small prospective study assessing diagnostic testing for nontraumatic abdominal pain in the emergency department (ED), diagnostic tests led to a change in diagnosis in 37 percent of patients and a change in disposition in 41 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an otherwise healthy adult, laboratory tests should generally only be ordered to rule in a clinically suspected diagnosis or to assess a patient with an acute abdomen of unclear etiology. The threshold for ordering a broader range of tests is lower for the immunosuppressed, elderly patients unable to provide a comprehensive history (eg, nonverbal, altered mental status), and those with significant underlying disease (eg, diabetes, cancer, HIV, cirrhosis).</p><p>A pregnancy test is required in women of child-bearing age. Either a urine or serum qualitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test may be used. Both tests are extremely sensitive. Patient self-assessment of pregnancy status is not uniformly reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Elevations in serum amylase concentrations are neither sensitive nor specific for pancreatitis, and may indicate a more ominous process, such as mesenteric ischemia or bowel perforation. Serum lipase is more sensitive and specific than amylase for pancreatitis, but elevations may be caused by a number of diseases. Elevation in the serum total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations are <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;common in uncomplicated cholecystitis.

The presence of pyuria, proteinuria, and hematuria suggests the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), but these findings may also be present with acute appendicitis or any inflammatory process occurring adjacent to either ureter. About 20 to 48 percent of patients with appendicitis have blood, leukocytes, or bacteria in their urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].

Hematuria may be present in as many as 87 percent of patients with AAA, which can lead to the misdiagnosis of nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Only a small percentage is abnormal. Plain radiographs can be helpful when bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, or a radiopaque foreign body is suspected, but cannot be relied upon to exclude these disorders. </p><p>The diagnosis of bowel perforation can be confirmed by the presence of free intraperitoneal air on an upright chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83050\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83050 \">image 2</a>).

However, in stable patients with AAA, CT is an excellent study for defining aortic size and the extent of the aneurysm. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage can also be identified. Hemorrhage can be visualized in nonenhanced scans making IV contrast unnecessary in emergent situations or when IV contrast dye may be contraindicated. CT is not limited by bowel gas or obesity and has a sensitivity of nearly 100 percent in diagnosing AAA.

However, CT with oral and IV contrast is a sensitive and specific study for diagnosing acute appendicitis. In some patient populations, CT without contrast demonstrates comparable accuracy. When using noncontrast CT to diagnose appendicitis, the most important findings are the inflammatory changes in the pericecal and periappendiceal fat. Therefore, the diagnosis can be missed in young, slender patients with little retroperitoneal and mesenteric fat. CT, even unenhanced, is extremely useful and sensitive in diagnosing free air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Medications such as beta blockers and glucocorticoids and comorbidities such as diabetes are more common among the elderly, and likely to mask symptoms and signs.</p><p>The emergency clinician's first priority is to look for life-threatening conditions. Patients presenting in shock or with peritoneal signs require <strong>immediate</strong> surgical consultation.

For patients with risk factors for AAA, pain radiating to the back, a pulsatile abdominal mass, or a known history of AAA, the clinician should perform a bedside ultrasound and obtain surgical consultation. Stable patients can subsequently undergo a CT scan, which provides information on the extent and location of the aneurysm. Early surgical consultation is important in the event the patient deteriorates during evaluation and may be appropriate even if the CT does not clearly show aortic pathology. Chest pain which extends to the abdomen, particularly when associated with neurological symptoms, suggests a thoracoabdominal aortic dissection. </p><p>Mesenteric ischemia is another life-threatening diagnosis to be considered in patients over age 50 with associated risk factors (eg, atherosclerotic disease, low cardiac output, atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulable states). Pain is often sudden and severe; the pathognomonic finding of &quot;pain out of proportion to exam&quot; may be present. In patients at risk for mesenteric ischemia, obtain CT angiography of the abdomen and early surgical consultation. Blood in the stool and elevated serum lactate concentrations may not be present initially. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An abdominal radiograph series can provide crucial information quickly in patients with diffuse tenderness or distention associated with vomiting or abdominal rigidity. If free air is identified, obtain immediate surgical consultation. If signs of bowel obstruction are identified, perform a CT scan to determine the cause and site of the obstruction. CT is also necessary when plain radiographs are nondiagnostic in these patients.

The differential diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">epigastric/right</span> upper quadrant pain includes diseases of the liver and biliary system. Biliary tract disease is among the most common causes of abdominal pain in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. An ultrasound can help delineate pathology within the gallbladder or liver. Liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase may be helpful in determining the cause of right upper quadrant pain and potential complications of gallstones (eg, pancreatitis). However, LFTs may not be abnormal in elder patients or cases of uncomplicated cholecystitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with tenderness in the lower quadrants, the differential diagnosis differs depending upon the patient's gender and age. In females, a pelvic examination is essential for diagnosis and to guide the selection of imaging studies. Pelvic pain is best evaluated with ultrasound. The patient with a normal pelvic exam, a negative pregnancy test, and concerning abdominal pain is best evaluated with a CT scan.</p><p>A testicular and scrotal examination is essential for male patients with lower quadrant abdominal pain. Patients with testicular tenderness or a tender scrotal mass require urologic consultation and a testicular ultrasound. Although more common in younger men, testicular torsion can occur in older patients. Consult a urologist immediately, prior to the performance of any studies, when torsion is suspected. Incarcerated inguinal hernia is more common in elder males. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a normal genitourinary examination can be grouped according to the clinician's suspicion for appendicitis. A male patient likely to have appendicitis requires prompt surgical consultation, as he may be taken to the operating room without further studies. If suspicion for appendicitis is not high, the options are to order a CT scan or observe the patient and perform serial examinations. For left lower quadrant pain, a CT scan is useful in diagnosing diverticulitis. While a CT scan is not necessary for all patients with suspected diverticulitis, the test is helpful in confirming the diagnosis in patients without a previous history of diverticular disease, and in assessing for complications (eg, abscess formation) in patients with known disease who present with more than mild to moderate symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-diverticulitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute diverticulitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation of patients with left upper quadrant tenderness follows the same decision tree as for right upper quadrant tenderness. Perform an ultrasound examination to evaluate for intraabdominal free fluid consistent with splenic rupture in patients with signs and symptoms of infectious mononucleosis, including Kehr's sign. Patients with a positive study require immediate surgical consultation. In the absence of a positive study, a CT scan may be useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients under 50</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of patients under 50 years of age is similar to that of those over 50. However, in this age group abdominal aortic aneurysm, mesenteric ischemia, malignancy, and extra-abdominal causes of abdominal pain are much less likely, while common manifestations of disease are more likely. The evaluation for women under 50 is described immediately below. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Women of childbearing age'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Women of childbearing age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First determine whether the patient is unstable and identify peritoneal signs and shock. While resuscitating unstable patients, perform a bedside ultrasound looking for free fluid and signs of pregnancy. Obtain a pregnancy test, a blood type and cross match sample, and immediate surgical or gynecologic consultation. An algorithm for the management of these patients is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54001\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54001 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>In stable patients, determine whether the patient is pregnant with a qualitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If so, perform an ultrasound and a sterile pelvic exam to assess for ectopic pregnancy and pelvic disease, and obtain a quantitative hCG. Immediate gynecologic consultation is required for any patient with an ectopic pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with an uncomplicated intrauterine pregnancy and concerning abdominal pain need further evaluation. Appendicitis is the most common surgical disease encountered during pregnancy; ultrasound is the diagnostic study of choice to assess for appendicitis during pregnancy. Contrary to common teaching, the area around McBurney's point is the most common location of pain in pregnant patients with appendicitis regardless of gestational age. Changes associated with pregnancy can make the diagnosis difficult. As examples, leukocytosis can be a normal finding and nausea, vomiting, and malaise occur often during the first trimester. Keep in mind that microscopic hematuria and pyuria occur in up to one-third of patients with acute appendicitis. Be wary of attributing concerning abdominal pain to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Obtain surgical and gynecologic consultation for patients with confirmed or suspected appendicitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute abdominal pain in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For nonpregnant patients, further evaluation is guided by history and findings on abdominal and pelvic examination. Keep in mind extra-abdominal causes of pain. As an example, women with acute coronary syndrome are more likely to present with so-called atypical symptoms.</p><p>Transvaginal ultrasound is helpful to evaluate for ovarian torsion or ruptured ovarian cyst in patients with a consistent history or unilateral adnexal tenderness. Often these entities present with the sudden onset of sharp, lower abdominal pain associated with nausea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stable patients with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) by history and examination may need no further studies and can be treated with oral antibiotics and close follow-up as outpatients. For patients with PID and more severe symptoms (eg, persistent vomiting, toxic appearing, unstable vital signs), inpatient treatment with IV antibiotics is appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Differentiating appendicitis from PID may be difficult without imaging, and misdiagnosis increases morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Clinical factors favoring appendicitis include migration of pain and the presence of nausea, vomiting, or anorexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. Factors favoring PID include pain or tenderness outside the right lower abdomen, vaginal discharge, and cervical motion tenderness.</p><p>In women without pelvic findings but with predominantly right lower quadrant pain, evaluation for possible appendicitis can be performed with either CT scan or ultrasound. Imaging with MRI is an accurate, alternative approach that may be useful for making the diagnosis of appendicitis, particularly when trying to avoid radiation exposure. Other causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain to consider include: UTI, nephrolithiasis, endometriosis, and neoplasm. Neoplasm is more common in women over 35 and pain may be accompanied by vaginal bleeding.

Multiple randomized controlled trials have disproved this notion, and patients being evaluated for abdominal pain in the emergency department (ED) should be treated judiciously with appropriate analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/82-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-86</a>]. According to a systematic review of these studies, opioids can alter the physical examination of patients with acute abdominal pain but they do not increase the number of incorrect management decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Morphine</a> in doses of 0.05 to 0.10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV (typical adult dose 2 to 5 mg IV), given approximately every 15 minutes until pain is controlled, is one reasonable approach. If a shorter acting agent is desired, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, at doses of 0.1 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV (typical adult dose 10 to 25 mcg), can be given in five minute intervals until pain is controlled. Careful monitoring of drug effects, particularly respiratory drive, is essential for any patient being treated with opioids. Patients with opioid dependency or chronic pain generally require larger doses.</p><p>Small randomized trials of adults with non-traumatic abdominal pain treated in the ED have found that patient-controlled analgesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> produced greater reductions in pain and no clinically significant differences in adverse events when compared to standard management using the same medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. In addition, a small, randomized, double-blinded trial of adults with primarily non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain found that a non-dissociative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> produced comparable analgesia to morphine (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> without serious adverse events reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Further study is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of these approaches. </p><p>When giving analgesics, the goal is to reduce pain to manageable levels, thereby making the patient more cooperative and possibly improving the accuracy of the abdominal examination by minimizing voluntary guarding. The goal is <strong>not</strong> to eliminate all pain and make the patient somnolent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3163515\"><span class=\"h1\">DISPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The elderly are at greater risk of significant disease, are less capable of tolerating such illness, and are more likely not to manifest clear and concerning symptoms and signs. Therefore, elderly patients with abdominal pain should be admitted or undergo prolonged observation if the clinician harbors any doubt about the nature of their disease.</p><p>Observation and reassessment is useful in the management of abdominal pain of unclear etiology. One retrospective cohort study found that a period of observation increased the certainty of diagnosing appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Other retrospective studies support the use of observation periods in unclear cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Clinicians should consider the likelihood of disease and the comorbidities, reliability, and social supports of the patient when determining whether to observe the patient with abdominal pain of unclear etiology in the emergency department (ED) or allow the patient to be discharged and return to the ED or their primary care clinician in 12 hours for reevaluation. Patients to be discharged must be provided with clear, written instructions about potential danger signs and where and when to return for emergent care or reevaluation.</p><p>The large majority of patients discharged from the ED, after an appropriate evaluation, with a diagnosis of nonspecific abdominal pain have a benign condition that resolves without further intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/9,91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,91,92</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study of 1411 patients discharged from the ED with nonspecific abdominal pain, 112 patients (7.9 percent) represented with abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].
