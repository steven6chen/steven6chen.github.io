A decrease in arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation may occur but is not required to diagnose an exacerbation.</p><p>Of note, diagnosis of an acute exacerbation is based on <strong>changes</strong> from an individual patient's recent baseline health status. There are no absolute thresholds that must be crossed to qualify for a pulmonary exacerbation designation. For example, a patient who is asymptomatic at baseline is typically considered to have a pulmonary exacerbation if there is a new cough with sputum production, fatigue, and decreased appetite, even though FEV<sub>1</sub> may remain in normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207771911\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no published protocols for grading the severity of pulmonary exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], CF clinicians routinely distinguish mild from severe exacerbations when planning treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A common approach is to consider the degree of worsening from baseline of each of the patient's signs and symptoms and arrive at a global assessment of the extent of decline. The designation is not based on reaching a specific level of impairment but rather on relative change from baseline. For example, a patient with near-normal baseline pulmonary status would be said to have a severe exacerbation if the acute illness was characterized by the onset of a productive cough and a large decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> (eg, greater than 10 percent). A patient with severe pulmonary disease would be considered to have a mild exacerbation if the cough, sputum production, exercise tolerance, and FEV<sub>1</sub> worsened minimally but perceptibly from prior baseline status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2177996686\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and consequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry reported that in 2015, 34.9 percent of patients had at least one pulmonary exacerbation severe enough to be treated with intravenous antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The consequences of each exacerbation can be considerable. Between 12 and 20 percent of patients who have a pulmonary exacerbation fail to reach 90 percent of their baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Most exacerbations are not associated with the appearance of bacterial species or strains that are new to the patient. Furthermore, there is no consistent pattern of change in bacterial communities leading up to pulmonary exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3645828726\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninfectious causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CF airway is characterized by chronic neutrophil-rich inflammation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations of pulmonary disease&quot;</a>). Inflammatory markers in serum and airway secretions increase during pulmonary exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although pulmonary infection is probably a major contributor to the airway inflammation, there is some evidence that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) deficiency itself can cause inflammation in the absence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In any case, the inflammatory processes associated with the bacterial infection appear to exceed the level that is required to limit systemic spread of infection and results in excessive damage to the lung. As a result, some antiinflammatory strategies are effective at limiting lung damage.

In addition, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines recommend increasing the frequency of airway clearance treatments during exacerbations beyond what is prescribed as part of the chronic therapy regimen (eg, increasing to four times per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100228217\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some CF clinicians administer a brief course of glucocorticoids to selected patients during an acute exacerbation, although the evidence is limited and there is considerable variation in practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

We use this strategy because glucocorticoids are useful for asthmatic symptoms in patients without CF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-emergency-department-management#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute asthma exacerbations in children: Emergency department management&quot;, section on 'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p>We do not recommend broader use of glucocorticoids (ie, the routine use of glucocorticoids for exacerbations in the absence of asthma-like symptoms).

These have shown that subjects treated with antipseudomonal antibiotics are more likely to have improvements in pulmonary function tests lasting up to four months, as well as reduction in sputum bacterial density, compared with subjects given placebo with chest physiotherapy and bronchodilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] or those treated with antibiotics with no antipseudomonal activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Since CF patients often carry the same bacteria for long periods of time, these cultures are relatively predictive of what will be found in specimens obtained at the start of a pulmonary exacerbation. If culture has not been performed within the last three months, we will usually obtain one at the start of an exacerbation and alter our initial antibiotic choices, particularly if the patient is responding poorly to the initial regimen<em>. </em>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection#H7028282\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;, section on 'Periodic surveillance cultures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3703265253\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic susceptibility testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely use in vitro susceptibility testing to guide antibiotic selection but recognize that the correlation between laboratory test results from the microbiology laboratory and clinical response is not high for gram-negative pathogens in patients with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Because the correlation between test results and clinical response is poor, alternate susceptibility strategies including biofilm culture and antibiotic synergy testing are under investigation. However, there is insufficient information to recommend these techniques over conventional in vitro susceptibility testing, as outlined below. These perspectives are in agreement with guidelines published by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional in vitro susceptibility testing &ndash; Selection of antibiotics is usually based on conventional in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. Special laboratory procedures are required to adequately test many of the gram-negative bacilli isolated from CF patients because these tend to grow poorly on standard media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Many laboratories test multiple morphotypes of the same species (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sputum cultures for the evaluation of bacterial pneumonia&quot;</a>). However, there are recognized limitations to this approach:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In retrospective studies of CF patients who were chronically infected with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and were treated with parenteral antibiotics for an acute exacerbation, there was no correlation between antibiotic susceptibility testing results and clinical outcomes, including pulmonary function (improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>]), weight gain, or time to the next pulmonary exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is concern about the reproducibility of antibiotic susceptibility testing of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> isolated from CF patients. Considerable variation was found when the same morphotype was tested multiple times and when a single isolate was tested by multiple laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The same bacteria species obtained from different airways of the same patient can have different phenotypes, including antibiotic-resistance profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This confounds the selection of antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing bacteria grown as biofilms &ndash; To address the limitations of conventional susceptibility testing, some laboratories have applied the technique to bacteria cultured under conditions that induce them to form biofilms in vitro. The rationale is that bacteria grown as biofilms may more closely mimic the properties of bacteria in the airways of CF patients, a proportion of which grow in self-generated biofilms. This type of testing is more likely to report antibiotic resistance because bacteria grown as biofilms are less susceptible to antibiotics compared with the same isolates grown under standard clinical laboratory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unfortunately, susceptibility testing of the biofilms grown using current laboratory techniques does not appear to have a clinical advantage over conventional susceptibility testing. Two randomized studies found no differences in clinical outcomes or bacterial density for patients whose antibiotic regimens were chosen based upon susceptibility results from biofilms versus conventional cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>], as outlined in a systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic synergy testing &ndash;<strong> </strong>Combinations of antibiotics have been tested to determine whether their combined effects are greater than the sum of their individual activities. The rationale is that multidrug-resistant bacteria that are often encountered in patients with CF may be susceptible to combinations of antibiotics, although they are resistant to each drug when tested separately. Indeed, studies have described in vitro synergistic effects of various combinations of antibiotics for many isolates of multidrug-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. But unfortunately, a large randomized trial showed no difference in clinical outcome when antibiotics were selected based on synergy testing compared with standard susceptibility testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2114238019\"><span class=\"h3\">General strategies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria &ndash; When in vitro testing can identify no antibiotic to which a bacterium is susceptible, our practice is to select a combination of antibiotics that would otherwise be chosen empirically for that pathogen. Retrospective studies indicate that many patients will improve clinically under these circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double antibiotic coverage &ndash; CF guidelines recommend at least one antibiotic to cover each pathogenic bacteria that is cultured from respiratory secretions and two antibiotics for <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The evidence supporting double coverage of <em>Pseudomonas</em> is lacking, but it has been the standard of care for many years. The article reporting the guidelines include considerable discussion regarding the pros and cons of double coverage. In the end, the guidelines committee concluded that the practice should be continued until definitive data supports single coverage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our practice is to follow this guideline but tempered by other patient factors, such as the severity of the exacerbation and response to therapy during past exacerbations (see <a href=\"#H3613074825\" class=\"local\">'Patient-specific considerations'</a> below). We generally avoid using two beta-lactam antibiotics simultaneously, but some CF clinicians are not as reluctant, particularly when other regimens have failed. Our decision is based upon in vitro studies showing that the antimicrobial effect of adding the second beta-lactam is unpredictable and can sometimes be antagonistic to the first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/53,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56</a>]. CF guidelines do not address double antibiotic coverage for other gram-negative organisms, such as the <em>Achromobacter</em> species, <em>B. complex</em> species, or <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em>. Our practice is to cover these organisms with two antibiotics, if possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coverage of multiple bacteria &ndash; It is not unusual for CF patients to have multiple bacterial species identified in their respiratory secretions. Selecting an antibiotic combination that covers all of the isolates is occasionally difficult without resorting to an impractically large number of antibiotics. Unfortunately, little information is available to determine the priority of the different pathogens if only a subgroup can be reasonably covered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response to a failing regimen &ndash; If a patient does not show clinical improvement within approximately five days of starting treatment, we alter the antibiotic regimen. We choose the new regimen either empirically, or by specifically adjusting the regimen if new culture results reveal a bacteria species not covered by the initial regimen. Failure to improve should also prompt a reassessment of contributing factors (eg, an asthma component to the exacerbation or the presence of a new pathogenic organism [virus, fungus, or mycobacterium]), which may not have been cultured or detected on initial sputum testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing the chronically prescribed antibiotics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic azithromycin &ndash; We continue administering oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> during the acute exacerbation if it is a component of the chronic pulmonary regimen (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;, section on 'Macrolide antibiotics'</a>). However, we temporarily stop it if continuation might cause adverse interactions with the antibiotics added to treat the exacerbation (eg, risk for QTc prolongation when used with fluoroquinolones).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic inhaled antibiotics &ndash; There is insufficient information to recommend whether to continue an inhaled antibiotic during an acute exacerbation when it is part of a patient's chronic pulmonary regimen. Our local practice is to suspend the inhaled medication. Others would continue the inhaled medication during an acute exacerbation but generally not as a substitute for one of the two-drug intravenous regimens for <em>P. aeruginosa</em> outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59661 \">table 2</a>). A guidelines committee of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation could not reach a conclusion regarding the risks and benefits of administering the same antibiotic by both intravenous and inhaled routes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of note, if both inhaled and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> are used, one needs to be aware that the inhaled drug can cause a modest increase in serum levels, possibly interfering with pharmacokinetic analyses and causing errors in dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3613074825\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient-specific considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although antibiotic selection starts with the principles outlined above, there are a number of factors that typically modify final choices based on an assessment of benefits versus risks.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of exacerbation &ndash; A severe exacerbation (see <a href=\"#H207771911\" class=\"local\">'Severity grading'</a> above) generally warrants rapid initiation of aggressive therapy, under the assumption that doing so will increase the chances of returning to baseline status. <em>S. aureus</em> should be covered with a first-line drug, and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> should be covered with two systemic antibiotics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59661 \">table 2</a>). Aggressive treatment is warranted because the risk of permanent loss of lung function if the infection persists is thought to outweigh the risks of adverse effects from drug toxicity and the burden and complications of intravenous access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For milder exacerbations, many clinicians will initiate treatment with a regimen that minimizes the risk for adverse effects, yet has a reasonable likelihood of success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Examples include selection of an oral antibiotic regimen, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus </em>(MRSA) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> alone for <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. If this less aggressive approach is used, patients should be monitored closely and treatment escalated to a more aggressive regimen if they do not return to their baseline level of function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug allergy and toxicity considerations &ndash; Allergies to antibiotics are common in patients with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] and influence the choice among the antibiotic options suggested by the culture results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. If acceptable alternatives are not available, desensitization protocols can be used for antibiotics that previously caused immediate hypersensitivity reactions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid drug desensitization for immediate hypersensitivity reactions&quot;</a>). In addition, any adverse effects that occurred during previous courses of antibiotics (eg, ototoxicity from aminoglycosides) influence drug selection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efficacy of past antibiotic regimens &ndash; Because of the uncertain value of using susceptibility testing to guide antibiotic selection, our practice has been to consider the response to past treatments, as measured by changes in symptoms and pulmonary function tests. If the same bacterial species are identified in recent cultures, we tend to select a regimen that was previously successful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient preferences &ndash; Although the treatment options we present to a patient are derived from the above considerations, patient preferences can influence the final decisions. For example, a number of patients have strong opinions about when they are willing to use intravenous antibiotics in given situations. After a discussion of the benefits and risks of the different options, we incorporate the patient's preferences when forming the treatment plan.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1967002993\"><span class=\"h3\">Route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The route by which an antibiotic is administered does not determine its effectiveness but rather its bioavailability. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> are highly effective antibiotics that achieve therapeutic levels when administered orally, thus obviating the need for intravenous delivery. Most other antibiotics that are effective for moderate or severe acute exacerbations must be administered intravenously.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral</strong> &ndash; It is common practice to initiate treatment with oral antibiotics for mild exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3613074825\" class=\"local\">'Patient-specific considerations'</a> above). However, if the initially chosen regimen does not achieve the desired goals, the regimen should be altered (see <a href=\"#H2114238019\" class=\"local\">'General strategies'</a> above). The following situations are appropriate for oral antibiotic treatment:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild exacerbations due to methicillin-sensitive <em>S. aureus</em> (MSSA) can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> when in vitro testing shows susceptibility. An exacerbation is considered mild if there is a small deviation from the patient's baseline pulmonary status, as measured by symptoms or pulmonary function tests (see <a href=\"#H207771911\" class=\"local\">'Severity grading'</a> above). Based on published pharmacokinetic studies, children with CF generally require higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than other children. (See <a href=\"#H1528751850\" class=\"local\">'Ciprofloxacin'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2307499058\" class=\"local\">'Sulfonamides'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild exacerbations due to MRSA can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, if in vitro testing shows susceptibility to these drugs.

However, antibiotics are sometimes clinically effective even if the in vitro testing suggests resistance (see <a href=\"#H3703265253\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic susceptibility testing'</a> above). For severe exacerbations, we attempt to treat <em>P. aeruginosa</em> with two antibiotics. For mild exacerbations we will use one, particularly if it is a fluoroquinolone that can be administered orally and avoid the higher cost, increased risk of adverse reactions, and inconvenience associated with drugs administered intravenously. (See <a href=\"#H2114238019\" class=\"local\">'General strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravenous</strong> &ndash; The following situations require use of intravenous antibiotics:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe exacerbations for which optimal systemic treatment requires at least one antibiotic that can be administered by intravenous route only.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure of oral antibiotic therapy to resolve the exacerbation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bacterial resistance to orally administered antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drug allergy or intolerance to the otherwise appropriate oral antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inhaled</strong> &ndash; Practice varies among clinicians regarding use of inhaled antibiotics as a component of the treatment for an acute pulmonary exacerbation, in conjunction with oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravenous antibiotics.

In general, the volume of distribution and total body clearance is increased for hydrophilic drugs (such as aminoglycosides, penicillins, and cephalosporins), in part because CF patients are generally undernourished and have decreased adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

There has been some interest in prolonging the duration of dose infusion of some beta-lactam antibiotics to better maintain drug concentrations above minimal inhibitory concentrations, although the clinical advantage of this approach has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>].</p><p>Dosing recommendations for antibiotics are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59661 \">table 2</a>) and detailed below. For many of the antibiotics, we agree with the doses recommended in a comprehensive review of antipseudomonal antibiotics in CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Therefore, starting doses of aminoglycosides for CF patients should be approximately 30 to 35 percent larger than those recommended for individuals without CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The dose and frequency from a previous course of treatment may be used initially if serum concentrations were in the target range and creatinine clearance is not substantially changed, but drug levels should still be monitored.</p><p>Careful monitoring of aminoglycoside levels is necessary to limit the risks of renal injury and ototoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/76-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-80</a>]. The renal damage can be manifested by elevation in creatinine. Patients receiving multiple courses of aminoglycosides may develop a syndrome of magnesium-wasting without azotemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. These adverse effects can be limited but not prevented by adjusting antibiotic dose and interval to avoid exceeding target serum levels, as described below. When clinically significant renal damage or ototoxicity is noted, efforts should be made to minimize subsequent aminoglycoside use. However, the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of many CF-prevalent bacteria may provide limited options for nonaminoglycoside regimens and require further use of these antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2138368457\"><span class=\"h4\">Once daily dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest dosing aminoglycosides once daily (known as &quot;consolidated dosing&quot; or &quot;extended-interval dosing&quot;) in CF patients with normal renal function. This approach is consistent with the guidelines endorsed by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and is supported by a Cochrane systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. This practice has been adopted by the majority of Cystic Fibrosis Centers, including pediatric programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The starting dose for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> is 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/24</span> hours for children and adults without renal insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59661 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Once daily administration is supported by a randomized trial in 244 patients greater than five years of age with acute CF exacerbations who were treated with a 14-day course of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> either once daily or divided three times daily, with dose adjustments to maintain antibiotic concentrations in a target range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The treatments were equally effective in improving pulmonary function (for change in FEV<sub>1</sub>, adjusted mean difference 0.4 percent [95% CI -3.3 to 4.1]). Once daily therapy was associated with a decreased incidence of nephrotoxicity (mean percent change in creatinine -4.5 [once daily] versus +3.7 [three times daily]). Of note, most of the data assessing efficacy and safety of once daily tobramycin dosing are derived from studies of patients greater than five years of age. Extended-interval dosing in populations without CF is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides#H374424323\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dosing and administration of parenteral aminoglycosides&quot;, section on 'Traditional versus extended-interval dosing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial dose adjustment &ndash; We do not use published tables or nomograms for selecting and adjusting aminoglycoside doses and intervals in patients with CF because the pharmacokinetics differ from those in non-CF patients and may result in suboptimal aminoglycoside concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Instead, we measure serum levels twice following the first dose (eg, at 2 and 10 hours after the dose) and use pharmacokinetic analysis to calculate the peak serum level and to extrapolate forward to determine serum levels around 18 hours after the dose. Consultation with a clinical pharmacist skilled in pharmacokinetic-based drug management may be helpful and is suggested. The targets are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calculated peak serum level between 20 and 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> and between 80 and 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/75,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,84</a>]. Note that this is the estimated peak level calculated from a pharmacokinetic analysis and <strong>not</strong> the measured level from blood samples drawn early after antibiotic infusion. Samples taken less than two hours post-infusion are still within the drug distribution phase, so calculations based on them would yield incorrect estimates of peak antibiotic concentrations and clearance rates leading to inappropriate dosing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calculated serum level &le;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> at 18 hours, so that there is at least a 6-hour period prior to the next dose when the patient will have low serum levels, to minimize toxicity. Slightly higher 18-hour levels (eg, &le;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> are also acceptable, provided the patient's renal function and clinical status are stable and the 18-hour level will be rechecked within three to four days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a dose that achieves the target peak level leads to too high a serum level at 18 hours, the dosing strategy is changed to the &quot;conventional&quot; approach, to reduce the risk of toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H3632268396\" class=\"local\">'Conventional dosing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent monitoring &ndash; After the initial dose has been established, we measure serum aminoglycoside levels once or twice per week, with each measurement timed for several hours prior to the next dose (ie, at 18 hours following the previous dose). The appropriate frequency of monitoring depends on baseline renal function, the concomitant use of potentially renal toxic drugs, and whether the patient has a history of prior aminoglycoside toxicity. The goal is to ensure that the aminoglycoside level remains relatively low for several hours prior to the next dose (ideally &le;0.5 for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> at 18 hours). An increasing 18-hour level suggests the possibility of renal injury and should prompt dose adjustment. We believe that the 18-hour time point is preferable to a true trough at 24 hours because in CF patients with normal renal function, the drug concentration is frequently below the level of detection at 24 hours, which would prevent early detection of renal impairment as manifested by increasing drug levels. Interpreting these low serum levels can be confounded if the patient is also receiving inhaled tobramycin. As an example, serum levels one hour after inhaling 300 mg tobramycin are 1.05&plusmn;0.67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> (mean &plusmn; standard deviation [SD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, we suggest measuring two levels (eg, at 2 and 10 hours after the dose) following any substantial change in dose, to allow pharmacokinetic calculations and assure that targeted levels are achieved. Two time point measurements are also recommended if large changes in volume of distribution are likely to have occurred during the course of treatment (eg, sepsis with capillary leak or right-sided heart failure), although these scenarios are uncommon in CF patients having a typical pulmonary exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p/><p>To monitor for renal toxicity, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are also measured whenever aminoglycoside serum levels are assessed. We also monitor serum magnesium levels in patients who have received multiple aminoglycoside courses within the past year and are therefore at increased risk for isolated tubular damage manifested by magnesium wasting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3632268396\"><span class=\"h4\">Conventional dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with renal insufficiency or evidence of delayed aminoglycoside clearance, we do not use once daily dosing for aminoglycosides. Instead, we use a conventional approach based on peak and trough levels to target drug levels, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peak serum concentration 8 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> or 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> (measured 30 to 45 minutes after the dose is given).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trough serum concentration &le;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> and &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> (measured just before the next planned dose).</p><p/><p>These are the targets used for conventional dosing of aminoglycosides, but patients with renal insufficiency will require lower doses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> longer dosing intervals than are used for patients with normal renal function.</p><p>In this situation, the dose and frequency from a previous course of treatment may be used initially if the creatinine clearance is not substantially changed and serum concentrations were within the target range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

Higher dose levels (eg, 1 gram twice daily) may also be appropriate based on theoretical considerations of pharmacokinetics and the level of susceptibility of the bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2307499058\"><span class=\"h3\">Sulfonamides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> for patients with CF should be increased by approximately 50 percent relative to that used for patients without CF. For example, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> with 800 mg sulfamethoxazole) should be taken three times daily for an adult with CF, rather than twice per day. This is because hepatic clearance of sulfamethoxazole is increased in CF due to accelerated acetylation, and renal clearance of trimethoprim is accelerated by unknown mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1366033390\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic treatment is typically continued until the signs and symptoms that defined the pulmonary exacerbation are largely resolved.

In one study, 23 percent of pulmonary exacerbations were associated with ongoing symptoms after 14 days of antibiotics, with further improvement between days 14 and 21 of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].

No difference was detected in long-term FEV<sub>1</sub> change or time to next antibiotic treatment for pulmonary exacerbation between subjects receiving home therapy as compared with hospital therapy. Because the site of treatment was decided upon by the patients' clinicians and not by random assignment, characteristics of the two groups may have differed in many ways that could confound the analysis.</p><p>When considering home therapy for a pulmonary exacerbation, resources must be available at home to replicate the hospital program including provisions for rest, meals, medications, and physiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-treatment-of-acute-pulmonary-exacerbations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Children require greater assistance than adults to accomplish these goals, and adult supervision is needed even for teenagers.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;, section on 'Pathogens'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of CF is frequently complicated by acute pulmonary exacerbations, superimposed on a gradual decline in pulmonary function. We recommend treating exacerbations with antibiotics rather than nonantimicrobial treatment alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The antibiotics are given either orally or intravenously, depending on the severity of the exacerbation, and selected based upon the sensitivities of the infecting bacteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59661 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1723025051\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above). Common practice is to select at least one antibiotic to cover each bacterial isolate that is cultured from respiratory secretions, and two antibiotics for <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H1513954250\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We typically treat <em>P. aeruginosa</em> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>, imipenem-cilastatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticarcillin-and-clavulanate-potassium-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticarcillin-clavulanate</a>, where available) <strong>plus</strong> one of the following: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, or a fluoroquinolone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>), guided in part by antibiotic susceptibility test results.

For CF patients with normal renal function, we suggest once daily dosing (&quot;consolidated dosing&quot;) rather than conventional dosing and monitoring, with adjustments of dose and timing based on monitoring of drug levels (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Once daily dosing has comparable efficacy with conventional dosing and monitoring but has advantages of possibly reducing the risk of nephrotoxicity and simplifying administration and monitoring.
