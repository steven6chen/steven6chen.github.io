In contrast to sarcomas in other body locations for which 50 to 70 histologic subtypes exist, the most common histologic subtypes of RPS are liposarcoma (well <span class=\"nowrap\">differentiated/dedifferentiated)</span> and leiomyosarcoma. Rarer subtypes can also be found, such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. </p><p>RPSs are typically large tumors and frequently very challenging to effectively treat. The morbidity of these tumors is primarily locoregional, although some subtypes can also metastasize. For patients with localized disease, complete surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment and only chance for cure. The technical aspects of surgery have evolved, and only in the last two decades has complete resection been feasible and safe in the majority of RPS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Non-sarcoma benign and malignant diseases can also arise in the retroperitoneal space and should be ruled out during the initial workup of patients presenting with a retroperitoneal tumor. For some of these diseases, surgery may not be the primary treatment (eg, lymphoma). For others, the principles of surgery discussed in this topic, which will focus primarily on RPS, may still apply; however, in some cases, the approach may be entirely different (eg, laparoscopic resection for adrenal neuroendocrine tumors). The management of these other retroperitoneal tumors is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pheochromocytoma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-nerve-tumors#H30353409\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral nerve tumors&quot;, section on 'Schwannoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease#H520462180\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Treatment of locoregional disease&quot;, section on 'General principles of locoregional management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3630337605\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) should be referred to a sarcoma specialist center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There are several advantages to this, including greater experience for this rare cancer, access to multidisciplinary care, and the availability of clinical trials and research protocols. Although practice patterns may vary by institution, specific evaluation of the patient by a surgical oncologist with experience in soft tissue sarcoma is ideal for the best coordination of care and understanding of disease biology, the latter of which is important for appropriate intraoperative decision making. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1132052788\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging and pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For surgical planning, patients should have a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may complement CT for tumors that extend into the pelvis or have possible involvement of the spine or nerve roots. In some cases, CT alone is adequate to diagnose RPS and even determine the histologic subtype without a biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is based on tumor characteristics (eg, fat component, suggesting liposarcoma) and the potential organ of origin (eg, inferior vena cava, suggesting leiomyosarcoma). However, there should be a low threshold for biopsy. This is particularly important if neoadjuvant therapy is anticipated. The preferred method is a percutaneous core needle biopsy done with a coaxial technique. Although there is the theoretical risk of tumor seeding with biopsy, the data suggest that the frequency of this is exceedingly low, and overall, the benefit of diagnostic clarity outweighs the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Need for biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>For the surgeon, a thorough preoperative review of the available cross-sectional imaging (eg, CT, MR) is critical. This is important to anticipate the extent of tumor involvement with adjacent organs and critical structures (eg, adjacent versus encasement versus gross invasion). Importantly, RPS frequently alters the normal anatomy of the retroperitoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F117050\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117050 \">figure 1</a>) and displaces (eg, kidney) or invades adjacent organs (eg, colon mesentery) and structures. In some cases, repeat imaging may be necessary for a better-quality study or additional contrast phases. Ultimately, the true extent of tumor involvement will be determined at the time of surgery. </p><p>For tumors with potential vascular involvement, the presence of remote collaterals (eg, abdominal wall) should be noted as this may impact the need for vascular reconstruction after resection (eg, graft replacement versus ligation without reconstruction). In addition, the surgeon should also look for the presence of parasitized vessels (eg, dilated lumbar veins) as these may be associated with increased intraoperative bleeding if not adequately controlled. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1422220527\"><span class=\"h2\">Determination of resectability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients without any evidence of distant metastasis on staging imaging studies, complete resection offers the only chance for cure. All patients with localized RPS should therefore be offered surgery unless the surgeon identifies the following findings on the preoperative imaging review, which would preclude resection: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal implants (sarcomatosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral renal involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive spine involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive mesenteric root involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive liver hilar involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive major vascular involvement</p><p/><p>Patient age and comorbidities should also be considered when determining whether to proceed with resection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2991815470\"><span class=\"h2\">Consideration of nonsurgical therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with RPS, a discussion should be carried out in the setting of a multidisciplinary tumor board to determine if there may be a benefit for nonsurgical therapies (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy). This is particularly relevant for cases in which the patient is &quot;borderline resectable&quot; (eg, vascular involvement with comorbidities). In select cases, tumor shrinkage with neoadjuvant therapy may facilitate resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Preoperative therapy for large high-grade or locally advanced tumors'</a>.) </p><p>Importantly, if radiation therapy is to be given, this should be done in the neoadjuvant setting to limit the toxicity to bowel that would, after tumor resection, fall into the treatment field. An alternative approach is to deliver intraoperative radiation therapy, although this is dependent on institutional practice and resources available. Retrospective data exist that suggest some benefit with radiation therapy in patients with RPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; however, the data are somewhat conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Results of a prospective clinical trial (STRASS) are pending. </p><p>Patients with RPS who are at high risk for distant metastasis (eg, leiomyosarcoma) should be considered for chemotherapy. This can be given after resection; however, there are some data to suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy offers no benefit in RPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If there is anticipated prolonged postoperative recovery due to the proposed extent of surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> comorbidities, there may also be a delay in receipt of chemotherapy. In these patients, consideration should be given for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, although there is currently a paucity of data to support this in routine practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1780209971\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical risk assessment and optimization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimization of any preexisting medical comorbidities should be done with the primary care provider and, if needed, with medical subspecialists (eg, cardiology). In particular, in anticipation of possible nephrectomy, patients who are at risk of renal insufficiency (eg, chronic hypertension, diabetes) may benefit from split renal function testing and, if needed, preoperative evaluation with a nephrologist. </p><p>For left-sided tumors, if splenectomy is anticipated, prophylactic vaccines should be given. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Immunizations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2337794196\"><span class=\"h2\">Other surgical specialty consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the plan is to move forward with resection, the surgical oncologist should be intimately familiar and comfortable with the technical aspects of surgery. If needed, referrals should be made preoperatively to other surgical specialists (eg, vascular surgery, urology) in anticipation of a multidisciplinary surgical team approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>In some patients, adjunctive procedures may also be needed (eg, intraoperative ureteral stent placement) and should be arranged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1712996450\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the patient, it is very important to establish the goals of surgery (eg, complete resection versus palliation of symptoms) with realistic expectations for potential <span class=\"nowrap\">immediate/late</span> complications and oncologic outcome. Patients with RPS must understand that even at experienced, specialist centers, these are still challenging surgeries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1638076784\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthesia considerations &ndash; For all patients, an open discussion with the anesthesiology team should take place as these are major operations. As there can be intraoperative hemorrhage, blood products should be made available. If there is potential for significant hemorrhage, adequate intravenous access with a central venous catheter may be appropriate. For closer hemodynamic monitoring, some patients may benefit from an arterial line. For patients with cardiac comorbidities, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram may be warranted. Practice patterns may vary by institution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of anesthesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-bleeding-and-minimizing-blood-transfusion-during-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reducing bleeding and minimizing blood transfusion during surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel preparation &ndash; The surgeon can consider giving preoperative bowel preparation (usually the day before surgery) in anticipation of possible colon resection, although with retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) surgery this is not universal or mandatory.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk and prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4279042265\"><span class=\"h1\">RESECTION OF PRIMARY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection has traditionally been the only potentially curative treatment for a localized, primary retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS). The ability to perform a complete surgical resection at the time of initial presentation is the most important prognostic factor for survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. However, it is critical for the surgeon to be able to make appropriate intraoperative decisions that balance the technical feasibility of resection and expected outcomes with an understanding of disease biology (eg, patterns of recurrence). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1302579529\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For RPSs, which are typically large tumors, adequate exposure is key. A midline laparotomy incision is most commonly used. This offers access to the major vessels and can be combined with extensions (eg, lateral, inguinal) as needed on either side to further optimize exposure. Intraoperatively, exposure is maintained with a self-retaining retractor. Laparoscopic or minimally invasive approaches are generally not appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Midline incision'</a>.)</p><p>If sarcomatosis is seen after entering the abdomen, biopsies of safely accessible lesions should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and provide tissue for analyses that might inform subsequent targeted therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1422220527\" class=\"local\">'Determination of resectability'</a> above.)</p><p>A careful examination of the continuity of the gastrointestinal tract should also be performed to identify any areas of incipient obstruction for which palliative bypass may be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H1849595717\" class=\"local\">'Palliative resection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1828625000\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once in the abdomen and once exposure is established, the surgeon should proceed with circumferential mobilization of the tumor while assessing for involvement of adjacent organs and structures. If possible, the surgeon should not commit (eg, ligate renal hilar vessels or transect colon) until tumor resectability is confirmed. Alternatively, for borderline resectable cases, the surgeon can approach the area in question (eg, mesenteric root) directly at the start of the operation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3741031506\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With rare exceptions (eg, palliation), the goal of surgery in RPS is complete resection. Most sarcoma specialists would define complete resection of RPS as <span class=\"nowrap\">R0/R1,</span> with ideally negative microscopic margins (R0), but with acceptance of the possibility of positive microscopic margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Given the typical large size of these tumors, an accurate pathologic assessment of all margins on the resected tumor is difficult to logistically achieve. Tumors should be removed in total (not piecemeal) without any gross disease left behind. In a retrospective review of 374 RPSs, in multivariate analysis, tumor rupture during resection significantly increased the risk of death at five years (hazard ratio 2.12, 95% CI 1.39-3.25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4158389053\"><span class=\"h3\">En bloc resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an adjacent <span class=\"nowrap\">organ/structure</span> cannot be surgically separated from the tumor without leaving gross disease behind, it should be resected en bloc with the tumor. Preoperative review of the available imaging should help the surgeon anticipate potential scenarios for en bloc resection and prepare for these, as needed (eg, consultation with other surgical specialists). (See <a href=\"#H1132052788\" class=\"local\">'Imaging and pathology'</a> above.)</p><p>The most common organs removed are the kidney and colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/11,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,18</a>]. As an example, in a multi-institutional study of 1007 patients with RPS, nephrectomy was performed in 55 percent of cases and colectomy in 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For left-sided tumors, the distal pancreas and spleen may also require resection. In RPS, there is no rationale for performing lymph node dissection. </p><p>The same surgical considerations apply to RPS that involves or originates from major blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The need for vascular resection may be anticipated preoperatively based on imaging; however, ultimately, the decision is made intraoperatively. Major vascular resection (eg, inferior vena cava, aorta) has been shown to be feasible and safe at experienced, specialist centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Oncologic outcomes in patients who have undergone major vascular resection are comparable to those without vascular involvement and therefore should be done when appropriate. </p><p>In RPS surgery, pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple procedure is infrequently done. In a multi-institutional study, these patients were shown to often require additional organ resection. Complication rates are moderate, and oncologic outcomes are overall poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the benefit of en bloc resection of limited vertebral (bony) spine, liver, or abdominal wall. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1406345537\"><span class=\"h3\">Compartmental resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For primary disease, there is controversy over the appropriate extent of resection when there is no obvious evidence of tumor involvement of adjacent <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/structures</span> at the time of surgery. Some sarcoma specialists advocate extended or compartmental resection in which adjacent <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/structures</span> are liberally resected to provide a &quot;margin&quot; of soft tissue around the tumor, analogous to what is done for extremity sarcomas. This surgical approach is associated with lower locoregional recurrence rates and, for low- and intermediate-grade tumors, improved overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/16,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23,24</a>]. </p><p>However, other sarcoma specialists have criticized these studies, pointing out their retrospective nature, inherent selection bias, and the potential for higher complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>Later studies suggest that the histologic subtype significantly impacts the oncologic outcomes (eg, patterns of recurrence) and may be useful to guide decision making for the extent of resection in RPS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/18,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27,28</a>]. </p><p>As an example, locoregional recurrence is the main pattern of recurrence for well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, whereas distant metastasis is more common in leiomyosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]. Since locoregional control is important for liposarcoma, some sarcoma specialists would consider this as rationale to perform extended resection; however, this is also controversial. One study showed that in some liposarcoma patients, recurrence may develop even in areas outside of the resection field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As an additional consideration, there are data to suggest subtype-specific differences in frequency of histologic evidence of invasion of en bloc resected organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2554955202\"><span class=\"h1\">RESECTION OF RECURRENT DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1378124570\"><span class=\"h2\">Re-resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to achieve complete resection is lower in recurrence compared with primary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most significant predictor of outcome following a local recurrence is the resectability of the recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/27,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31-33</a>]. </p><p>Oncologic outcomes are significantly better in patients whose tumors are resected compared with those who are not resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/27,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31-33</a>]. As an example, in one multicenter series of 219 patients with locally recurrent retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS), the two-year overall survival rates for those undergoing resection versus no resection were 73 and 43 percent, respectively, while at five years, overall survival rates were 43 and 11 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Therefore, if feasible, re-resection should be considered for a patient with local recurrence.</p><p>The decision-making process to re-resect, including timing, can be challenging and is ideally done in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board. Patients most likely to benefit from re-resection are those with a longer disease-free interval, no history of tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">rupture/piecemeal</span> resection at the primary resection, low-grade tumors (especially well-differentiated liposarcomas), and unifocal rather than multifocal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/27,31,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31,33,34</a>]. For recurrence in retroperitoneal liposarcoma specifically, it may also be reasonable to start with a short interval period of observation with serial imaging to assess the disease biology. Data from one study suggest that the average monthly growth rate of the recurrent tumor may be useful to guide selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>For re-resection, the technical approach is similar to primary resection, but the surgeon should anticipate lysis of adhesions, which can add to operative time and morbidity. The natural tissue planes are also likely to have been altered from the initial operation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1849595717\"><span class=\"h2\">Palliative resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients with advanced, unresectable disease and severe symptoms from their RPS, resection may be performed for palliative intent. In this situation, debulking (incomplete) or piecemeal resection may be performed. </p><p>Most single-institution series have shown that incomplete resection is associated with inferior survival compared with complete resection, with equivalent survival to patients who do not undergo any surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/11,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,36-38</a>]. In one study, however, incomplete resection improved median overall survival (20 versus 10 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This benefit in terms of oncologic outcome (survival) may be even more pronounced specifically in patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma (26 versus 4 months), based on data from another study focused on this histologic subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>As the goal of surgery is symptom relief, strictly speaking, the survival outcomes are not relevant. The challenge in selecting RPS patients for palliative resection is often in determining whether surgery will truly offer durable symptom relief (eg, pain control). For more acute issues (eg, gastrointestinal obstruction), palliative surgery can often provide immediate symptom relief; however, the benefit has been shown to be typically transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In patients with known metastatic disease, an additional consideration is that recovery from major abdominal surgery and the interruption of chemotherapy may also risk disease progression at other sites. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2238965098\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients, early postoperative ambulation is encouraged. Adequate incisional pain control can be provided with an epidural catheter, although this practice may vary by institution. An epidural may be particularly helpful for the upper midline portion of an incision, to improve pain control and allow for proper respiratory mechanics. The patient's diet is advanced as tolerated; tube feeding or parenteral nutrition is rarely required.</p><p>In the subsequent few days after surgery, third spacing into the retroperitoneum becomes a potential issue. Fluid management can be more challenging in the setting of a solitary kidney for patients who underwent nephrectomy as part of their resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Overall hospital stay can vary from 3 to 5 days or extend to 7 to 10 days, if there is a significant postoperative ileus and depending on presence of complications. Patients with advanced age or comorbidities may benefit from a temporary skilled nursing facility for physical rehabilitation after hospital discharge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H990841906\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIOPERATIVE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data suggest that at sarcoma specialist centers, the incidence of major perioperative (30-day) morbidity is approximately 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>In the immediate postoperative period (approximately 24 hours) after retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) resection, bleeding is the major risk and can, in some patients, be a significant issue depending on the extent of resection and operative details. </p><p>Ileus may develop due to multifactorial reasons, including prolonged length of surgery, third spacing, or high narcotic requirements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-ileus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative ileus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with any other open abdominal operation, intra-abdominal fluid collections may develop that may require percutaneous drainage if clinically significant or if there is concern for abscess. The surgeon should also consider lymphatic leak, urine leak, or pancreatic leak, depending on the type of resection that was done. </p><p>The most common organs resected during RPS surgery are the kidney and colon. Considerations for these patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal <span class=\"nowrap\">dysfunction/failure</span> &ndash; Nephrectomy has been shown to be overall well tolerated in patients who have undergone RPS resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]; however, in some patients with baseline diabetes or hypertension, there is potential for acute and chronic renal insufficiency. Nephrectomy may also impact the ability to tolerate nephrotoxic chemotherapy regimens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>), and patients may need additional hydration prior to receipt of intravenous contrast for follow-up surveillance imaging. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-colectomy complications &ndash; Right colectomy generally does not have any lasting effects; however, patients with left colectomy may have ongoing issues with changes in bowel habits such as constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Since each RPS resection is unique, it is important to individualize the potential postoperative complications. Specific considerations may include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular graft thrombosis &ndash; Patients who have had major vascular resection may need surveillance for graft thrombosis depending on their type of reconstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-pancreatectomy complications &ndash; Patients who have had pancreatic resection may develop a leak, also known as a postoperative pancreatic fistula. In addition, if a significant portion of the functional parenchyma was removed, these patients may experience enzymatic insufficiency or may even develop diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the body and tail of the pancreas&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incisional hernia &ndash; Patients who had very large tumors or those with tumors that involved the abdominal wall musculature may develop ventral or lateral abdominal wall hernias. When bothersome, surgical repair is warranted. In some cases, these may require complex abdominal wall reconstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of abdominal wall hernias in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>For some patients, particularly those with combined multiorgan resections, potential complications may also be compounded (eg, pancreatic leak onto a vascular anastomotic suture line). In general, the surgeon should keep these considerations in mind; however, there are no data to support routine postoperative cross-sectional imaging, unless indicated by clinical suspicion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3288075753\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP AND SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In soft tissue sarcoma, surveillance after surgery is important to detect recurrence; however, algorithms are not standardized, especially for retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS).

Given the rarity of this cancer, multicenter collaboration is critical. As an example, the Trans-Atlantic Retroperitoneal Sarcoma Working Group (TARPSWG) was formed in 2013 with the goal of collaboration to understand and develop better treatments for RPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Technical papers and consensus guidelines for primary, recurrent, and metastatic disease have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/22,45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,45-48</a>], as well as original research studies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1736128126\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroperitoneal sarcomas (RPSs) are rare cancers and typically large tumors that are challenging to effectively treat. Complete surgical resection is the only chance for cure. (See <a href=\"#H2640219514\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with RPS should be referred to a sarcoma specialist center to take advantage of the greater experience for this rare cancer, access to multidisciplinary care, and availability of clinical trials and research protocols. (See <a href=\"#H3630337605\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For surgical planning, RPS patients should have a good-quality, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, which should be thoroughly reviewed by the surgeon to anticipate the extent of resection based on potential tumor involvement of adjacent organs and structures. RPS frequently alters the normal anatomy of the retroperitoneum, displacing or invading adjacent organs and structures. (See <a href=\"#H1132052788\" class=\"local\">'Imaging and pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is offered to all good-risk surgical candidates who have localized RPS unless any of the following findings are present on the preoperative imaging (see <a href=\"#H1422220527\" class=\"local\">'Determination of resectability'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peritoneal implants (sarcomatosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bilateral renal involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensive spine involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensive mesenteric root involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensive liver hilar involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensive major vascular involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ultimately, the true extent of tumor involvement and resectability will be determined at the time of surgery. Each RPS resection is unique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall approach to treatment of a patient with RPS should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board to determine if the patient may benefit from nonsurgical therapies before or after surgical resection. (See <a href=\"#H2991815470\" class=\"local\">'Consideration of nonsurgical therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate referrals should be made to any surgical specialists (eg, vascular surgery, urology) that may be required to facilitate complete resection. For some patients, adjunctive procedures may also be needed (eg, prophylactic ureteral stent placement) and should be arranged. (See <a href=\"#H2337794196\" class=\"local\">'Other surgical specialty consultation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For resection of primary disease, the tumor is removed in total (not piecemeal), without leaving gross disease behind. Adjacent organ(s) or structure(s) that cannot be surgically separated from the tumor are resected en bloc with the tumor. The kidney and colon are the most commonly involved organs. Liberal resection of adjacent <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/structures</span> even without obvious evidence of tumor involvement can be considered, although this is controversial and practice patterns vary by institution. The histologic subtype may be useful to guide decision making for more extensive resection. (See <a href=\"#H3741031506\" class=\"local\">'Tumor resection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether to resect local tumor recurrence can be a challenging decision that should be done in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board. Patients most likely to benefit from re-resection have a longer disease-free interval, no history of tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">rupture/piecemeal</span> resection at the primary resection, low-grade tumors (especially well-differentiated liposarcomas), and unifocal rather than multifocal disease. The technical approach to re-resection is similar to primary resection, with the anticipated challenges of reoperative surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2554955202\" class=\"local\">'Resection of recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative care and anticipation of potential <span class=\"nowrap\">immediate/late</span> postoperative complications is individualized based upon the extent of resection and operative details (eg, organs resected). (See <a href=\"#H2238965098\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H990841906\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After resection, patients with RPS should undergo a baseline postoperative contrast-enhanced CT scan to establish lack of residual disease. The intensity of surveillance should be individualized to each patient with consideration of histologic subtype and expected risk (and patterns) of recurrence. In general, CT scans are generally repeated every three to six months for two to three years, then every six months until five years, and then annually.
