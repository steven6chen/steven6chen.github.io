Certain groups of children and adults are at increased risk of acquiring severe or complicated illness from influenza (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72029\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72029 \">table 1</a>). Among healthy children, influenza generally is a self-limited and uncomplicated disease. However, it can be associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Influenza causes an appreciable disease burden (eg, school and work absence, increased frequency of outpatient medical visits), and children are important vectors for the spread of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Immunization is the most effective means of preventing influenza infection. This topic will discuss influenza immunization in children. The use of antiviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of influenza in children, the design of influenza vaccines, and influenza vaccination in adults are discussed separately.

Two types of influenza vaccines are licensed in the United States: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> (IIV), which is administered intramuscularly (IM), and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which is administered intranasally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79474 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60449 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Types of vaccine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend annual influenza immunization for all persons &ge;6 months of age in the United States in agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Immunization is particularly important for individuals who are at increased risk of severe and complicated influenza (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79334 \">table 4</a>), household contacts of individuals who are at increased risk of severe and complicated influenza, and household contacts of individuals who cannot be vaccinated (eg, children &lt;6 months of age, children and adolescents with contraindications to vaccination). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Target groups'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the 2017-2018 influenza season in the northern hemisphere, we suggest IIV rather than LAIV for prevention of influenza in children (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The effectiveness of quadrivalent LAIV is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Choice of vaccine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3627642991\" class=\"local\">'IIV versus LAIV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When vaccine supply is limited, immunization efforts should focus on children and adolescents who are at risk for severe or complicated influenza and household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children 0 to 59 months of age and other individuals who are at increased risk of severe or complicated influenza (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79334 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Target groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Annual immunization is necessary even if the previous season's vaccine contained one or more of the antigens to be administered in the current season because immunity declines during the year following vaccination. Immunization should be administered in the fall. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Schedule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vaccine schedule varies depending upon age and prior history of influenza immunization.
