(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Substance misuse in pregnant women&quot;, section on 'Opioids'</a>.) Some of these risks are related to repeated opioid exposure and withdrawal, while others are related to factors associated with substance misuse (eg, smoking, poor nutrition, needle sharing). The rationale for opioid-substitution therapy during pregnancy is to reduce these risks by preventing complications associated with opioid misuse and narcotic withdrawal, facilitating prenatal care and drug treatment, reducing drug-related criminal activity, and helping the patient avoid the myriad of other risks associated with the drug culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Comprehensive opioid-substitution therapy that includes prenatal care reduces the risk of obstetric and neonatal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded that the available evidence supports the use of buprenorphine as a potential first-line medication for pregnant opioid-dependent women who are new to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result of the ACOG opinion and increasing data suggesting a lower rate of neonatal withdrawal with buprenorphine use, use of buprenorphine for opioid maintenance therapy during pregnancy has been increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, the improvement in neonatal outcome may relate to differences in baseline characteristics between women who are offered methadone or buprenorphine treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However, we consider the following factors (in order of priority) when counseling women about their options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Program availability</strong>.

Clinicians prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> in office-based settings are required to have the capacity to refer the patient for counseling, but not required to provide counseling on-site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient preference</strong>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Buprenorphine</a> provided in an office-based setting allows some privacy since patients do not have to attend a clinic daily for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> treatment. The patient receives a prescription for buprenorphine for up to 30 days at a time, fills the prescription at a pharmacy, and takes the medication as prescribed on her own. However, lack of frequent clinical contact may make office-based treatments less suitable for some opioid-dependent women.</p><p/><p>In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> may pose a lower risk of overdose mortality than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> because of the &quot;ceiling effect&quot; (see <a href=\"#H16284340\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. For the newborn, in utero exposure to buprenorphine rather than methadone may result in a lower risk of preterm birth, higher birth weight, and larger head circumference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It may also be associated a lower rate and severity of neonatal withdrawal. The overall pros and cons of buprenorphine substitution therapy are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87713 \">table 2</a>). Ultimately, the best treatment option is the one which maximizes retention in treatment and prenatal care, and minimizes recidivism.

The dose of buprenorphine does not appear to be predictive of need for treatment of NAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized and cohort studies of neonatal outcome after in utero <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> exposure (515 neonates) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> exposure (855 neonates), buprenorphine exposure was associated with a modest reduction in treatment for NAS (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-0.98) and mean length of hospital stay (-7.23 days, 95% CI -10.64 to -3.83), as well as higher mean gestational age, weight, length, and head circumference at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, there was little difference in risk of NAS treatment after adjustment for confounding.</p><p>The largest trial in the systematic review was the landmark Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research (MOTHER) trial, which included 175 pregnant women with opioid dependency randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> at eight international sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Compared with methadone, buprenorphine therapy resulted in significantly lower doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> for treatment of NAS (mean total 1.1 versus 10.4 mg), shorter duration of treatment for NAS (4.1 versus 9.9 days), and shorter neonatal hospital stay (10.0 versus 17.5 days). However, there were several limitations to this trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], including a statistically non-significant but markedly higher attrition rate from the buprenorphine treatment arm than from the methadone arm (33 versus 18 percent), which may have been due to the buprenorphine dosing protocol. The usual maximum dose of sublingual buprenorphine (32 mg daily) may not have been sufficient to prevent symptoms of withdrawal in some pregnant women (usually those requiring &gt;140 mg methadone daily).</p><p>Risk of NAS should not be the sole factor considered in choosing an appropriate opioid substitution therapy in pregnant women. NAS, when properly identified and managed, has not been associated with long-term harm. All of the pros and cons of each opioid substitution option should be considered.

These are interrelated variables (ie, larger head circumference is the result of later gestational age at birth) and most studies were limited in their ability to control for confounding factors (eg, prior obstetric history, smoking, etc). Other large studies have not consistently confirmed a difference in these outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>There are few long-term neurodevelopmental studies of buprenorphine-exposed fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buprenorphine-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].
