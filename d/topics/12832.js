The Renal Physicians Association (RPA), for example, sponsored an evidence-based guideline relating to withholding and withdrawing from dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and a United Kingdom Expert Consensus Group published guidelines for symptom management in adults dying with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) sponsored a workgroup on the topic of palliative or supportive care in CKD outlining the need for additional study and the initiation of palliative treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Since nearly 20 percent of dialysis patients stop dialysis prior to death and, increasingly, older patients are choosing not to begin dialysis in part due to poor outcomes and decreasing functional status with dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>], it is likely that all nephrologists will be involved in end-of-life care of ESRD and CKD patients. As a group, however, physicians are poorly trained in palliative care and often feel uncomfortable with the care of dying patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In one survey of American and Canadian physicians, for example, only approximately 40 percent of 360 nephrologists stated that they were very well prepared to make end-of-life decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Despite the identification of the importance of palliative care in ESRD care, nephrology fellows remain uncomfortable and poorly trained in these aspects of clinical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withdrawal from and withholding of dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Providing palliative care to patients with CKD begins at the time of diagnosis and continues throughout the patient's life. With progression of kidney disease, palliative care assumes increasing importance with time and is integral to &quot;good deaths.&quot; Dialysis unit staff should be involved in such care and also must recognize their responsibilities in the areas of advance care planning, pain and symptom management, and bereavement support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/4,9,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,21-24</a>]. A national survey of palliative care in the United Kingdom again demonstrated opportunities to improve this aspect of ESRD care and prompted the authors to suggest guidelines for renal palliative care initiatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss aspects of care that typically require attention in the patient who withdraws from dialysis or chooses not to initiate dialysis. Principles of palliative care will be addressed, as well as guidelines for the use of analgesia in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative care refers to the comprehensive management of the physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and existential needs of patients and families in the setting of serious illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The goal of palliative care is to achieve the best possible quality of life by relieving suffering, controlling symptoms, and restoring functional capacity, while maintaining sensitivity to personal, cultural, and spiritual beliefs and practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Throughout the course of a serious illness, palliative care assumes an increasing priority over disease-directed care and eventually focuses upon the dying process. The term &quot;supportive care&quot; is replacing the term &quot;palliative care,&quot; in part to distinguish this kind of care from end-of-life care and because the term &quot;supportive&quot; may be more meaningful to patients and families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Both terms will be used in this topic review.</p><p>Integral to the precepts of supportive care is an interdisciplinary approach focusing upon physical comfort (managing pain and other symptoms) and psychological, spiritual, and social support for the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family and community. With chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, the dialysis and transplant community, as well as the patient's identified family, will be involved in the giving and receiving of supportive care.</p><p>Hospice referral, which is one aspect of palliative care, is appropriate for those expected to live less than six months if the disease follows its usual course and for those who are willing to relinquish curative treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no uniform policy about continuing dialysis for hospice patients. The specific hospice program's policy about continuing dialysis while a patient is receiving hospice care will need to be addressed on an individual basis. Similarly, Medicare reimbursement for hospice and dialysis requires clarification on a case-by-case basis for patients on dialysis who are referred for hospice care. Patients who withdraw from dialysis should be eligible for hospice in nearly all cases; yet, even in this group, hospice is underutilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Efforts to increase the dialysis patient's access to hospice despite ongoing dialysis care are continuing. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptom control after dialysis discontinuation'</a> below.)</p><p>Important aspects of palliative care in the CKD patient include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of quality of life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative, no dialysis care versus initiation of dialysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance directives</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morbidity and mortality review for quality of death</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bereavement care for family and community</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality-of-life assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various tools have been used by individual nephrologists and dialysis programs to assess the quality of life of patients. However, the most appropriate tool and its use in patient care have not yet been clarified. Depression, sexual dysfunction, reduced functional status, and low rates of employment are all relatively common among patients with CKD.</p><p>Quality-of-life assessment should begin with the diagnosis of kidney disease and continue until death. Periodic assessment of a patient's quality of life should therefore become as routine as are the current measurements of serum hemoglobin levels and dialysis adequacy. In addition, symptom assessment and treatment in ESRD patients are not routine, but integral, to quality-of-life assessment. Multidimensional patient-reported quality of life varies over time, regardless of whether overall trajectories improve or worsen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], emphasizing the need for serial assessments. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptom control after dialysis discontinuation'</a> below.)</p><p>Increasingly, frailty, a clinical construct initially described in the geriatric population, is being recognized as a predictor of mortality and quality of life and functional status in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Frailty may be defined either by performance on tests of physical function (eg, get up and go test) or by self-reported function; with either definition, mortality is higher among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult#H3777493204\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance dialysis in the older adult&quot;, section on 'Effect of frailty'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Advance directives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Living wills and health care proxies are referred to as advance directives, which are underutilized by patients with CKD. Increased use of advance directives may occur if advance care planning is centered within the patient-family relationship, rather than within the patient-physician relationship, and if dialysis unit staff becomes more comfortable discussing these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Although patients and families rarely discuss stopping dialysis as part of advance care planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], efforts to improve the advance care planning process may result in more attention being paid to this topic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because advance directives are completed by a competent patient and not the physician, do not resuscitate (DNR) orders and physician orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST) are not advance directives but are actual physician orders. Efforts to ensure that patient wishes for end-of-life care are followed led to the development of POLST, which are appropriate in states and areas in which they are legal documents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] Both POLST, where available, and DNR orders are important documents for dialysis patients to consider as part of the advance care planning process. Systems issues act as barriers to advance care planning and the completion of advance directives among dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The contemporary view of advance directives emphasizes their use as a means of preparing for death, achieving control, relieving burdens on loved ones, and strengthening interpersonal relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Time is thus provided for writing wills, discussing funeral arrangements, and attending to the psychosocial and spiritual concerns of the patient and family. The interdisciplinary approach to these issues in dialysis patients will involve nurses, social workers, clinicians, religious counselors, and in some cases, peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withdrawal from and withholding of dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in the care of the patient with end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2361305084\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prognosis should be discussed with patients who are deciding whether or not to begin dialysis and with patients who are contemplating stopping dialysis and with those with superimposed acute illnesses. An understanding of prognosis is necessary for patients and families to make informed decisions regarding goals of care and the management of chronic illnesses like CKD and ESRD.</p><p>It is necessary for the nephrologist to be able to provide guidance regarding prognosis to allow patient-centered decision making to occur. Tools are available to guide the nephrologist in assessing prognosis, including the Charlson comorbidity score, the patient's functional status, and the surprise question (&quot;Would I be surprised if this patient died within the next year?&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Online applications that utilize these predictors are also available but have not been validated across diverse populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Dialysis patients report relying on dialysis unit staff to address their palliative care needs (not only advance care planning, but also pain and symptom management and psychological and spiritual support). However, less than 10 percent of patients report discussing end-of-life issues with their nephrologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom control after dialysis discontinuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mean survival from the last dialysis treatment to death in a patient who stops dialysis is six to eight days, with a range of 2 to 100 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. Longer survival should be expected in patients with significant residual renal function.</p><p>Most patients who withdraw from dialysis die in the hospital; they are rarely referred for hospice care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. As examples, ESRD patients composed only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>71 of 14,253 <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/families</span> served by hospice in North Carolina in 1996</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>29 of 4728 South Carolina <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/families</span> served by hospice in 1995</p><p/><p>A review of hospice claims from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) for the 115,239 dialysis patients who died between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2002 showed that 22 percent of patients withdrew from dialysis, of whom 42 percent used hospice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The median per patient cost of care in the last week of life was significantly lower in the group who withdrew and used hospice. This was primarily because only 23 percent of that group died in the hospital compared with 69 percent of the group who withdrew and did not use hospice. Factors associated with hospice use included patient age, race, reason for withdrawal, ability to walk or transfer at dialysis initiation, and state of residence. The authors concluded that hospice is underutilized among dialysis patients who withdraw from dialysis and that increased hospice use in this population may enable more patients to die at home with significant cost savings.</p><p>Reports have shown that family-reported quality of end-of-life care is better for patients with cancer and dementia than it is for ESRD patients, largely due to more frequent palliative medicine consultations and DNR orders and less frequent intensive care unit admissions among the former groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Uremic deaths are generally described as painless and characterized by increasing somnolence. However, in one prospective study of deaths in patients withdrawing from dialysis, 42 percent of 79 patients were reported to be in pain by their <span class=\"nowrap\">families/loved</span> ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A survey by the same group of investigators of families of patients who had died found that 75 percent of patients were in pain during the last week of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Underlying comorbid conditions such as peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and neuropathy were felt to be causes of the perceived pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Other reported symptoms include weakness, agitation, depression, myoclonus or muscle twitching, dyspnea or agonal breathing, fever, diarrhea and dysphagia, and nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,50</a>]. Older patients who chose conservative (nondialysis) care also reported significant symptoms during their last month of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Their symptoms were similar to those of ESRD patients withdrawing from dialysis and included fatigue, pruritus, shortness of breath, and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition to specific symptom management, general supportive care should be emphasized for the dying patient with interventions to ensure patient comfort such as lip balm, mouth swabs, positioning, back rubs, fans, and the elimination of blood draws and dietary restrictions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uremic-pruritus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uremic pruritus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Muscle cramps in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned, pain is a frequently reported symptom in the dying patient with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11,44,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,44,50</a>]. Moreover, pain remains undertreated in many hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. This is particularly the case when patients die in an institution versus the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/50,52,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52,54</a>].</p><p>The use of specific analgesics in this patient population must be guided by the observation that, because of impaired renal excretion, many such agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their breakdown proteins accumulate in those with renal disease, resulting in significant, adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> should not be used in those with chronic kidney dysfunction, because its metabolite, normeperidine, accumulates, leading to central nervous system excitability and seizures. Similarly, prolonged use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> in patients with CKD may lead to the accumulation of morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide, which may contribute to the development of myoclonic jerks (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;, section on 'Myoclonus'</a>). The accumulation of morphine-6-glucuronide may also lead to prolonged narcosis in those with kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, for short-term use (days), morphine is an excellent analgesic for dying patients with ESRD and is also useful in the treatment of dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,58</a>]. In general, it is recommended that morphine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> be avoided in dialysis patients, that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> be used with caution, and that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> appear to be relatively safe to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/55,56,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56,59</a>].

However, it should be noted that shortening or eliminating dialysis treatments may actually result in the development of uremic symptoms in some patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Other symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and delirium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and delirium may also be treated with medications dosed for the level of kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,63</a>].</p><p>For patients with uremia-induced nausea, evidence-based guidelines by a United Kingdom Expert Consensus group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> at a 50 percent dose reduction. If symptoms persist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levomepromazine-methotrimeprazine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levomepromazine</a> was recommended as an alternative antiemetic (not available in the United States). The consensus group was concerned about the risk of extrapyramidal reactions with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> and suggested that it should be used with caution and at a maximum dose of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours. The recommendation of dopamine antagonists was partially based on the likelihood that uremic toxins primarily affect the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Furthermore, a small, double-blind, crossover study of 10 uremic patients reported that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> was more effective than metoclopramide for managing nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-death assessment and bereavement care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some dialysis programs have begun assessing the quality of a patient's death as part of quality assurance activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This promotes examination of the character <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> quality of a patient's death and focuses attention on efforts to ensure establishment of advance care planning, symptom control, and effective communication among interdisciplinary teams, patient, and family. Bereavement support to families and involved caregivers (eg, dialysis unit staff, transporters, etc) may be addressed by dialysis unit sponsored memorial services, follow-up calls, and cards of condolence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2361305290\"><span class=\"h2\">Developing a patient-centered approach including conservative or supportive, nondialytic care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient-centered care plan, which includes conservative, nondialytic care, is increasingly recognized as an important issue for nephrologists caring for CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,65-67</a>]. In a patient-centered model, an attainable treatment goal for each patient is based upon the patient's medical condition and treatment options, the patient's preferences and expectations within his or her psychosocial context, and the patient's prognosis.</p><p>Considering these variables, the following three treatment goals may be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,68</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis as a bridging treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis as a final destination treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active medical management without dialysis</p><p/><p>Palliative or supportive care is integral to each and every treatment goal within patient-centered care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,68</a>]. Emerging evidence suggests that patients who are conservatively managed receive more palliative care, hospice care, and less intensive care at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The establishment of outpatient kidney palliative care clinical programs will likely facilitate the provision of comprehensive palliative care to CKD patients choosing to forego dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27722032\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care refers to the comprehensive management of the physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and existential needs of patients within the context of family and community. The goal of palliative care is to achieve the best possible quality of life by relieving suffering, controlling symptoms, and restoring functional capacity, while maintaining sensitivity to personal, cultural, and spiritual beliefs and practices. Palliative care in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) incorporates all members of the interdisciplinary team (physicians, nurses, social workers, peers, families). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Principles of palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important aspects of palliative care in those with ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) include assessment of quality of life and prognosis and the development of appropriate advance directives through an advance care planning process. The advance care planning process should include options for conservative care versus dialysis, symptom control after dialysis discontinuation, and bereavement care for family and community. Dialysis patients have symptoms (pain, fatigue, and pruritus) that are commonly undertreated. Hospice is underutilized in those with ESRD and should be considered in any patient refusing or withdrawing from dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Quality-of-life assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Advance directives'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptom control after dialysis discontinuation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Post-death assessment and bereavement care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An emerging role for conservative management of CKD patients choosing to forego renal replacement therapy requires that nephrologists learn communication skills and develop methods of caring for this group of patients.
