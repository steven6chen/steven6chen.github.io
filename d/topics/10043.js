ARA can be derived directly from animal foods, or from seed oils, which are rich in n-6 linoleic acid, the precursor for ARA. In the United States, the typical diet is high in seed oils, and thus higher in n-6 compared with n-3 LCPUFA. Human milk generally contains more ARA than DHA, and the amount does not vary substantially with maternal dietary intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>ARA is a major component of brain phosphoglycerides, generally in greater concentrations than DHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, ARA has a proinflammatory role in <span class=\"nowrap\">eicosanoid/docosanoid</span> synthesis.

For example, DHA concentration compared with the other fatty acids ranges from 0.1 weight percent (g per 100 g total fatty acids) in a malnourished Sudanese woman, to 2 weight percent in a Chinese woman who consumes fish as a main dietary source (a 20-fold increase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the average amount of DHA in human milk is about 0.35 weight percent, and a mother who consumes 100 mg per day of DHA will maintain this concentration in her breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Term infants who consume 750 mL per day of human milk with a concentration of 0.35 weight percent have a daily DHA intake of 100 mg, which is consistent with the recommended intake outlined above.

In the United States, DHA concentrations in maternal and donor human milk used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are frequently low, with reported mean values between 0.1 and 0.32 weight percent, which may not meet the needs of premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/18,20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,23,24</a>]. As an example, a DHA milk concentration of 0.1 weight percent only provides a dietary intake of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for the preterm infant fed 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> enteral milk, whereas a milk concentration of 0.5 weight percent at the same volume would result in an intake of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/4,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,25,26</a>].

The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming a variety of seafoods to achieve at least 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> n-3 LCPUFA intake. Mercury in seafood is a concern primarily for fish harvested from contaminated waters. As a result, we follow the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines that recommend breastfeeding mothers consume one to three weekly servings of a variety of types of seafood to ensure adequate breast milk DHA content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These recommendations are intended to achieve a maternal dietary DHA intake of at least 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.

Data were also being accumulated on DHA's role in brain and retinal cell structural development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. As a result, LCPUFAs, after obtaining FDA GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status, were added in varying formulations and concentration to formulas for term and preterm infants. The vast majority of infant formula sold in the United States contains LCPUFAs, although the concentration varies between formulas based on the manufacturer's decisions about targets for DHA intake. DHA-containing infant formulas generally provide DHA at concentrations of 0.15 to 0.32 weight percent (ie, percent of total fatty acids). This is intended to provide approximately the amount of DHA found in breast milk. However, clinically significant benefits of LCPUFA (or DHA) supplementation remain controversial based on clinical trials, with the strongest evidence related to visual benefits. (See <a href=\"#H7495424\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1309992\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available data have been inconclusive regarding benefits of n-3 LCPUFA provision in infant formula for both term and preterm infants. Nonetheless, there is good evidence that addition of LCPUFAs is safe without any adverse effects on growth, using available products that are low in toxic contaminants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/21,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,32</a>]. Support for addition of LCPUFA is based on research that demonstrated n-3 LCPUFAs are important components of the developing brain and retina during the third trimester of pregnancy and the first two years of life. In addition, cognition may be slightly better in infants fed human milk than in those who receive bovine milk-based formula, which is lower in n-3 LCPUFA content compared with human milk. Dietary preformed n-3 LCPUFA may be particularly beneficial in preterm infants who miss the placental transfer of n-3 LCPUFAs, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), during all or some of the third trimester. (See <a href=\"#H109751441\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1356262\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for LCPUFA supplementation'</a> below.)</p><p>Until results from future research are available, we suggest the following approach to LCPUFA nutrition for preterm and term infants:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with dietary guidelines in the United States, which recommend that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should consume one to three weekly servings of a variety of types of seafood high in n-3 LCPUFA and low in mercury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111607 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Alternatively they may consume another source of n-3 LCPUFAs that provides at least 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> DHA. This target is intended to provide sufficient amounts of n-3 LCPUFAs to ensure adequate accretion of n-3 LCPUFAs for the fetus and infant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-nutrition-during-lactation#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal nutrition during lactation&quot;, section on 'Fish intake'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish consumption and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all infants receive maternal breast milk. If maternal breast milk is not available, we suggest provision of donor human milk rather than infant formula, if a safe and appropriate source of donor milk is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants&quot;, section on 'Donor human milk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For preterm infants, we suggest particular attention to dietary guidelines for n-3 LCPUFA intake by the lactating mother. The goal for maternal intake is the same as for mothers of term infants (ie, at least 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> DHA). Although preterm birth is associated with lower DHA stores, there is no specific evidence of benefit from additional n-3 LCPUFA supplementation to the mother or of direct supplementation to the infant. However, maternal supplementation with fish oil (3 grams daily), or supplementation of the expressed breast milk with DHA and arachidonic acid (AA, each 30 mg per 100 mL of mother's milk), have been used in clinical trials and appears to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In the United States and many other countries, infant formulas designed for preterm infants are supplemented with n-3 LCPUFAs.</p><p/><p>The evidence about the clinical effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation is summarized in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1356262\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR LCPUFA SUPPLEMENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some, but inconsistent, evidence that breastfeeding compared with infant formula feeding is associated with improved cognition (ie, 3 to 5 points on cognitive tests), and with visual acuity in preterm infants. Although the mechanism of this effect is uncertain, it has been hypothesized that these results are due, at least in part, to differences in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content, which is present in human milk but not in bovine milk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Neurodevelopmental outcome'</a>.)</p><p>LCPUFA, and particularly DHA, is an important component of the developing brain and retina, accumulating especially during the third trimester of gestation and the first six months of life. Breastfed infants have higher levels of LCPUFA in the cerebral cortex than those fed standard infant formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, the known antiinflammatory effects of n-3 LCPUFAs have led to hypotheses that DHA supplementation to premature infants might reduce risks for comorbid disease. </p><p>Together, these observations have led to the hypothesis that supplementation of bovine milk-based formula with LCPUFAs would improve cognition and visual acuity, and possibly reduce comorbid disease in preterm infants. Addition of DHA to human milk via human milk fortifiers or supplements given to the lactating mother has also been suggested for preterm infants to compensate for the loss of accretion during the third trimester of pregnancy. However, clinical trials have not consistently shown that LCPUFA supplementation improves outcomes in preterm and term infants, as discussed below (see <a href=\"#H7495424\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below). Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of infant formulas used in the United States and many other countries contain LCPUFA supplementation at varying levels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7495424\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 30 clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of LCPUFAs. Most of the trials have focused on possible effects on cognition, visual acuity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> growth. The duration of n-3 LCPUFA feeding in infancy is consistently related to visual acuity at one year of age.

For example, it has been speculated that the polymorphism of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) 1 and FADS2 genes, which modify the encoding of delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase, may have a direct effect on the amount of n-3 LCPUFA available to the developing fetus and neonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

It is preferentially incorporated into the rapidly developing brain and retina during the last trimester of pregnancy and the first two years of life, with ongoing accumulation through childhood. (See <a href=\"#H3741497262\" class=\"local\">'Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and other n-3 LCPUFAs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm infants miss some of the fetal accretion of n-3 LCPUFAs including DHA, which normally occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy. Human milk often provides less DHA than needed to mimic the intrauterine accretion values of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3741497262\" class=\"local\">'Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and other n-3 LCPUFAs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H174264684\" class=\"local\">'Human milk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available data generally suggest beneficial effects of a steady supply of n-3 LCPUFA including DHA during fetal life and infancy. The best established effects are on vision, while benefits on other outcomes remain inconclusive. Evidence comes from a variety of clinical studies: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Breastfeeding versus formula &ndash; Limited evidence suggests that breastfeeding compared with infant formula feeding is associated with slightly improved cognition (ie, 3 to 5 points on cognitive tests) and, in preterm infants, visual acuity. Although the mechanism of these effects is uncertain, it has been hypothesized that these results are due, at least in part, to differences in DHA content, since DHA is present in human milk but not in bovine milk. Premature infants are thought to be particularly vulnerable to deficits in DHA because they lack the accretion of these lipids that normally occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy. For preterm infants, human milk typically provides somewhat less DHA than needed to match the fetal rate of accumulation. (See <a href=\"#H1356262\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for LCPUFA supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Supplementation of formula &ndash; Clinical trials of LCPUFA supplementation in formula are inconsistent for most outcomes in preterm or term infants, precluding any firm conclusions. Systematic reviews have noted benefits to visual acuity but found no effect on overall cognition. A large randomized trial noted a slight improvement in cognitive scores for girls only at 18 months follow-up, and no difference in language development or behavior at two to five years of age. No adverse effects of supplementation and no overall effects on growth were noted. (See <a href=\"#H1232874163\" class=\"local\">'Term or preterm infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Supplementation for very preterm infants &ndash; Similarly, several trials of LCPUFA supplementation to very preterm infants have found little or no effects on cognitive development. A separate analysis found that supplementation had no significant effect on the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, or neonatal infection. Trials are in progress to investigate whether supplementation of relatively high doses of DHA has beneficial effects on BPD, particularly in the most premature infants. (See <a href=\"#H1232874170\" class=\"local\">'Very low birth weight infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there is limited evidence for a benefit of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation, there is good evidence that supplementation is safe without any adverse effects on growth, using available products that are low in toxic contaminants. Therefore, we use the following clinical approach (see <a href=\"#H1309992\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that pregnant and lactating women should consume one to three weekly servings of a variety of types of seafood high in n-3 LCPUFA, or consume another source of n-3 LCPUFAs that provides at least 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> DHA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This target is intended to provide sufficient amounts of n-3 LCPUFAs to ensure adequate accretion for the fetus and infant, and is consistent with dietary guidelines for pregnant and lactating women in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish consumption and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that all infants should receive maternal breast milk, for a variety of health benefits (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). If maternal breast milk is not available, we suggest provision of donor human milk rather than infant formula, if a safe and appropriate source of donor milk is available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For term or preterm infants who are formula-fed, it remains uncertain what the optimal concentration of DHA should be, but the more current practice of including LCPUFAs in these infant formulas appears to be appropriate and safe.
