CA manifest as variably sized and shaped soft papules or plaques on anogenital skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F108140%7EOBGYN%2F60946%7EOBGYN%2F51759%7EDERM%2F108145%7EDERM%2F108144%7EDERM%2F108141%7EDERM%2F108146%7EDERM%2F108147\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108140 graphicRef60946 graphicRef51759 graphicRef108145 graphicRef108144 graphicRef108141 graphicRef108146 graphicRef108147 \">picture 1A-H</a>). </p><p>A diagnosis of CA can have negative psychosocial effects and may be accompanied by symptoms, such as pruritus, pain, and bleeding. Some cases of CA spontaneously resolve; however, spontaneous resolution is unpredictable. Most patients desire treatment.</p><p>Effective treatment options for CA include patient-applied and clinician-administered therapies. First-line patient-applied therapies include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, podophyllotoxin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinecatechins-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sinecatechins</a>. First-line clinician-administered treatments are cryotherapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a>, surgical excision, electrosurgery, and laser therapy. The selection of therapy should be individualized and based upon consideration of the extent of disease, patient preference, cost, adverse effects, treatment availability, and the response to previous treatments.</p><p>The management of external CA in adolescent and adult males will be reviewed here.

Men may benefit from the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HPV is a common viral infection that manifests in some patients as anogenital warts. HPV infection is acquired through direct genital contact. Most men and women acquire HPV infection at some point during their lifetime.

Patients should inform current sexual partners of their diagnosis. Sexual partners may benefit from an evaluation for anogenital warts and other sexually transmitted diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-management-of-external-condylomata-acuminata-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It is unclear whether eradicating anogenital warts in men decreases future transmission of HPV. Condom use may help to reduce acquisition of anogenital warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-management-of-external-condylomata-acuminata-in-men/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; however, HPV infection may still be transmitted through contact with infected skin that is not covered by a condom.</p><p/><p>The negative impact of anogenital warts on psychosocial well-being has been demonstrated in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-management-of-external-condylomata-acuminata-in-men/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Clinicians should offer resources for psychologic support when needed.</p><p>Disclosure of sexually transmitted infections to sexual partners may have beneficial psychologic effects. In a survey study of 117 individuals with genital herpes, 82 individuals with HPV, and 75 individuals without sexually transmitted infection, persons who disclosed that they had a sexually transmitted infection had significantly more positive feelings about aspects of their&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;self-concept than those who had not disclosed their sexually transmitted infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-management-of-external-condylomata-acuminata-in-men/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Additional resources for patient information are provided.

While anogenital warts may spontaneously resolve, they also may spread or enlarge, making treatment more difficult. Therefore, deferring treatment is not recommended. Given the uncertainty regarding resolution and the negative psychosocial and physical effects of anogenital warts (eg, pruritus, pain, bleeding, interference with micturition, defecation, and sexual function), most patients desire treatment.

No single therapy has emerged as the standard of care. (See <a href=\"#H4085548123\" class=\"local\">'First-line patient-applied therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2032688637\" class=\"local\">'First-line clinician-applied therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Size of anogenital warts</strong> &ndash; Although patients with single or multiple small (eg, &lt;1 cm) anogenital warts may be effectively treated with any of the patient-administered or clinician-administered first-line treatments, clinician-administered destructive therapies are often favored given the rapid results compared with long-term topical therapy. Cryotherapy is a typical first-line treatment given that it is a widely available, well-tolerated therapy that is easy to administer and does not require anesthesia. Electrosurgery is an additional favored option for the treatment of small genital warts; however, electrosurgery may result in more scarring than cryotherapy. Both cryotherapy and electrosurgery may result in local skin dyschromia; the risk is greatest in patients with moderately to darkly pigmented skin (skin phototypes IV to VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>)).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Extensive disease (eg, large exophytic plaques or nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111006\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111006 \">picture 2</a>)) may be best managed with surgical excision, laser ablation, or electrosurgery. Topical agents are commonly used as adjunctive therapy for remaining disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-management-of-external-condylomata-acuminata-in-men/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient preference </strong>&ndash; Patients may express a preference for patient-applied versus clinician-applied treatments. Some patients prefer to treat CA privately at home, whereas others prefer to avoid the prolonged treatment courses associated with patient-applied therapies and prefer the rapid results of clinician-administered ablative treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, patients with visual, cognitive, or physical impairments that limit their ability to identify, treat, and reach all warts are not good candidates for patient-applied treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cost </strong>&ndash; The cost of topical therapies are prohibitive for some patients. Of the first-line patient-applied therapies, podophyllotoxin is the least expensive. United States pricing information is available in the drug information content available with UpToDate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects </strong>&ndash; Potential adverse effects of treatments should be reviewed with patients. Local inflammatory reactions are common side effects of podophyllotoxin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinecatechins-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sinecatechins</a>. Systemic side effects can occur from treatment with imiquimod, podophyllin resin, or intralesional interferon injections. Clinician-administered ablative therapies can result in scarring and dyspigmentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment-specific side effects are discussed in greater detail in the sections on specific therapies.

Men with large, bulky perianal or genital warts that may require extensive surgical removal should be referred to a colorectal surgeon or urologist. In addition, for patients with perianal warts, we suggest performing or referring for anoscopy to evaluate for intra-anal warts. Intra-anal and intraurethral warts are typically managed by colorectal surgeons and urologists, respectively.

For topical patient-applied therapies, patients should be re-evaluated after the completion of a treatment course.

The optimal way to prevent anogenital warts is vaccination prior to the onset of sexual activity. In addition, limiting the number of lifetime sexual partners and delaying the age of first intercourse reduce the risk of HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-management-of-external-condylomata-acuminata-in-men/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

Anogenital warts are almost always acquired through sexual activity.

Patients may benefit from education on HPV infection and CA. Clinicians should offer resources for psychologic support when needed. (See <a href=\"#H3180835498\" class=\"local\">'Patient counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although CA may spontaneously resolve, resolution may take months and is unpredictable. Treatment should be offered to all patients. Most patients elect to proceed with treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2988879892\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no single best approach to the treatment of anogenital warts. Treatment selection should be individualized and based upon consideration of factors such as the extent of disease, patient preference, cost, adverse effects, and treatment availability. (See <a href=\"#H2391134520\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4076912291\" class=\"local\">'Treatment selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major treatment options for CA can be divided into patient-applied and clinician-administered therapies. For patient-applied therapy, we recommend use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, podophyllotoxin, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinecatechins-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sinecatechins</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Patients treated with patient-applied therapies should be able to identify and reach all anogenital warts and should be willing to adhere to several weeks or longer of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H4076912291\" class=\"local\">'Treatment selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4085548123\" class=\"local\">'First-line patient-applied therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-line clinician-administered therapies include cryotherapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a> (TCA), surgical excision, electrosurgery, and carbon dioxide laser therapy. We suggest <strong>not</strong> treating anogenital warts with podophyllin resin based upon the availability of safer and more effective therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4076912291\" class=\"local\">'Treatment selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2032688637\" class=\"local\">'First-line clinician-applied therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who fail to respond to an initial first-line therapy may benefit from switching to an alternative first-line intervention or combination treatment.
