Approximately half of all pregnancies were unintended and 40 percent of these were terminated, meaning that 21 percent of all pregnancies were aborted. The number of induced abortions declined by 13 percent between 2008 and 2011, but the number of terminations of intended pregnancies has increased due to advances in prenatal testing for fetal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Although the psychiatric impact of pregnancy termination is controversial, most studies, especially higher-quality studies, suggest that induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of serious mental health disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. It is important to note that the psychological context of pregnancy termination varies depending upon whether the reason is an unwanted pregnancy, multiple gestation, or fetal anomalies.</p><p>The potential psychiatric outcomes of pregnancy termination are reviewed here. Other issues regarding pregnancy termination are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392034\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE REGARDING POTENTIAL OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most reviews have concluded that abortion does not harm a women&rsquo;s mental health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/4,5,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,11-13</a>]. However, some of the evidence regarding the psychiatric aspects of pregnancy termination is of low quality, and study designs are inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Many studies do not use validated mental health measures or control for pre-abortion mental status and whether the pregnancy is planned, and the presence and type of comparison group varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Specifically, many studies compare women with unplanned pregnancies to women planning an ongoing pregnancy. The circumstance of an unwanted pregnancy involves factors that are likely to be associated with emotional distress, such as impaired relationships and financial difficulties.</p><p>In addition, psychological responses to pregnancy termination often vary by social, cultural, religious, or legal context, so generalizations across populations are difficult to make [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Emotional responses to abortion would be expected to differ between environments where induced abortion is permissible and where abortion is disapproved. If abortion poses risks such as injury, financial ruin, or incarceration, it is difficult to distinguish psychological responses to abortion from fears of the consequences.</p><p>The following sections focus upon mental health outcomes following pregnancy termination for unintended pregnancy. Psychiatric outcomes of pregnancy termination due to fetal abnormalities are discussed in a separate section. (See <a href=\"#H329798180\" class=\"local\">'Termination for fetal anomalies'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic reviews the best evidence rather than all of the evidence, consistent with all UpToDate topics. Thus, prospective observational studies are favored over retrospective studies, studies with appropriate control groups are favored over those with inappropriate or no control groups, studies with more events of interest are favored over those with fewer outcomes, studies of longer duration are favored over shorter studies, and studies that adjust for potential confounders (eg, prepregnancy mental disorders) are favored over studies that did not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22207621\"><span class=\"h2\">Mental disorders in aggregate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies, especially higher-quality studies, suggest that induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of mental health disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. As an example, the primary findings in a systematic review of 44 studies included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among women with unwanted pregnancies who either terminate the pregnancy or give birth, the rate of mental illness is comparable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unwanted pregnancies are associated with an increased risk for mental illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postabortion mental illness is most consistently associated with pre-abortion mental illness. Other factors that may contribute to mental health problems following pregnancy termination include negative attitudes towards abortion, pressure from a partner to have an abortion, and negative reactions to the abortion including grief or doubt.</p><p/><p>A subsequent retrospective study included adolescents who either had an induced abortion (n = 1041) or gave birth (n = 394) and were then followed up to age 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Following the abortion or childbirth, the risk of subsequent psychiatric disorders or episodes of self-harm were comparable. However, educational achievement was greater among girls who underwent abortion, whereas the girls who gave birth were more likely to receive income support (welfare).</p><p>Some data suggest that the patient population who undergo abortion have a higher baseline rate of mental health disorders. As an example, national registry study identified females who had no mental disorder and who either had a first-time first-trimester induced abortion or first childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The study estimated the rates of first psychiatric contact (either inpatient admission or outpatient visit) for the 12-month period after the abortion or delivery as compared with the nine-month period preceding the event. The primary findings included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among women who had an abortion (n &gt;84,000), the incidence of first psychiatric contact for the 12 months after and the nine months preceding the abortion was comparable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of psychiatric contact among women (n &gt;280,000) was greater after childbirth than before.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of mental health problems was greater in the nine months preceding abortion than the nine months preceding childbirth.</p><p/><p>A subsequent national registry study identified women who had been hospitalized for mental disorders (eg, unipolar major depression, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, or personality disorder) and subsequently became pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among the women who had a first-time first-trimester induced abortion (n &gt;2800), the risk of readmission during the 12 months after the abortion or during the nine months prior to the abortion was comparable (relative risk [RR] 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.34). By contrast, in the women who delivered their first child (n &gt;5200), the risk of readmission was greater during the 12 months after delivery than the nine months prior to delivery (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4).</p><p>Women frequently struggle with decisions to end pregnancies. However, the conflicts and ambivalence regarding the abortion decision typically occur before the abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While unintended pregnancy brings about a crisis and stress for many women, the pregnancy termination is usually perceived as a resolution of the crisis and brings a sense of relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Although a meta-analysis of 22 observational studies (n &gt;870,000 subjects, including more than 160,000 who had an abortion) found an 81 percent increased risk of mental health problems (eg, depression, anxiety, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substance use disorders) among women who had a prior abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], this analysis has been widely criticized because of several methodologic problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/4,5,13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,13,21</a>]. As an example, half of the studies included in the meta-analysis were conducted by the same investigator who performed the meta-analysis, which raised concerns about selection bias; in addition, the meta-analysis did not assess the quality of studies that were included and did not control for mental illness prior to the induced abortion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H694328\"><span class=\"h2\">Suicide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no convincing evidence that induced abortion increases the risk of suicidal ideation or behavior:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study examined women in a nationally representative sample who had their first induced abortion (n = 218) or childbirth (n = 1547); analyses that controlled for prepregnancy mental disorders and prepregnancy violence (eg, childhood physical abuse, rape, or being threatened with a weapon) found that the probability of suicidal ideation or behavior was comparable for the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second retrospective study examined women in a nationally representative sample who had their first induced abortion (n = 259) or had no abortions and their first childbirth (n = 677); analyses that controlled for prepregnancy mental disorders found that the probability of suicidal ideation or behavior was comparable for the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review that assessed study quality, no high- or fair-quality studies have found an increased risk of completed suicide associated with pregnancy termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, two poor-quality studies found an association between pregnancy termination and completed suicide. In addition, a study not included in the review also found an association between termination of pregnancy and deliberate self-harm (suicide attempt), but the investigators concluded that the finding was probably confounded by factors such as psychological and social difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H694373\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induced abortion does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of psychosis; however, few studies have examined this issue.

The incidence of depression following abortion or delivery was comparable (25 and 29 percent). In addition, an analysis of a subgroup who had an abortion (n = 225) or delivery (n = 310) before 1980 found that depression occurred in fewer women who terminated the pregnancy than delivered (26 versus 35).

In the subset of women who received an abortion just prior to the clinic&rsquo;s gestational limit (n = 411), 41 percent felt regret, but among those feeling regret, 87 percent also felt relief. In addition, women who were turned away because they exceeded the gestational duration limit at that clinic (n = 178) were more likely to experience regret (regarding their ongoing pregnancy) than women who were still eligible and received an abortion. Other studies have also found that the predominant short-term emotion after abortion is relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/33,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,45,46</a>].</p><p>The prospective Turnaway Study also examined longer-term regret associated with pregnancy termination. Women in the study who terminated their pregnancy (n = 667) were assessed every six months for three years; at each follow-up interview, approximately 95 percent thought it was the right decision. Regret and other negative emotions (anger, guilt, and sadness) were uncommon and were more likely to be reported by women who had terminated planned pregnancies; the intensity of these negative emotions diminished over time. Continued evaluations of the women for a total of five years found that the most common emotion at each assessment was relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-termination-and-potential-psychiatric-outcomes/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3584859798\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-esteem</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-esteem in the short term appears to be lower in women who are denied an abortion, compared with women who receive an abortion.
