It is caused by a problem with the &quot;pylorus,&quot; which is the opening between the stomach and the first part of the small intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72947\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72947 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Normally, food passes through the pylorus without a problem. But in pyloric stenosis, the muscle in the pylorus gets too thick and blocks the opening. Then, food can't pass from the stomach to the intestine. This causes symptoms.</p><p>Pyloric stenosis happens most often in young babies, especially in babies 3 to 6 weeks old. It rarely happens in babies older than 3 months. Doctors don't know for sure what causes pyloric stenosis, but the condition sometimes runs in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27265839\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pyloric stenosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyloric stenosis causes vomiting, usually right after a feeding. The vomiting, called &quot;projectile vomiting,&quot; is forceful. This type of vomiting is different from the less forceful vomiting that happens when a baby spits up. In pyloric stenosis, vomit shoots far out from the baby's mouth.</p><p>It is common for babies with pyloric stenosis to seem hungry and want to feed again after they vomit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27265854\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my baby's doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your baby has these symptoms, tell his or her doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27265869\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for pyloric stenosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your baby's symptoms and do an exam. This will help the doctor or nurse decide whether your baby's vomiting is normal (spitting up) or abnormal.</p><p>If the doctor or nurse thinks your baby could have pyloric stenosis, he or she will probably do an imaging test called an ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body. It is the usual test to check for pyloric stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27265884\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pyloric stenosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyloric stenosis is usually treated with surgery. During surgery, the doctor will widen the pylorus so that food can pass through it from the stomach to the intestines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27265899\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
