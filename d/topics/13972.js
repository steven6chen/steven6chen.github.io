Aggressive treatment of relapsed disease is required to maintain the high cure rate while minimizing the toxicity associated with treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of relapsed and refractory testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients who will relapse do so within the first one to two years after their initial treatment. Late relapses (after five years) can occur but are rare. The intensity of follow-up is dictated by the histology of the original tumor (seminoma versus nonseminomatous GCT), and the stage and risk of recurrence at original presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oncologic follow-up after initial therapy includes history and physical examination, monitoring serum tumor markers (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG], alpha-fetoprotein [AFP]) for evidence of recurrence, and imaging studies (chest radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] of abdomen and pelvis). The optimal schedules for follow-up have not been defined in clinical trials, but empiric guidelines have been established based upon observational experience. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several clinical situations may mimic tumor relapse and must be carefully distinguished from a true relapse to prevent overtreatment. These include pulmonary nodules secondary to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> lung injury, the growing teratoma syndrome, and false-positive elevation of beta-hCG that is due to hypogonadism. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Detection of recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to oncologic follow-up, men successfully treated for testicular GCTs require surveillance for complications of treatment.
