Although injury may occur at any site, the esophagus is most prone to impaction. The severity of esophageal damage after button battery ingestion depends upon the length of time that the battery is lodged in place, the amount of electrical charge remaining, and the size of the battery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Damage to the esophagus may be seen as early as two hours after ingestion, with more severe damage after 8 to 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/4,14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,17</a>]. As the duration of impaction increases, the mucosa becomes edematous and the battery adheres tightly to the mucosa. If the battery remains in place, ulceration and perforation can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>].</p><p>Electrical discharge appears to be the most prominent mechanism for mucosal injury after button battery ingestion in most clinically significant cases. Mechanisms of injury from battery ingestion include electrical discharge, pressure necrosis, and leakage of battery contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>], each of which contribute to corrosive damage when the battery is in contact with a mucosal surface for a sufficient period of time as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrical discharge</strong> &ndash; The flow of electric current from the battery through the surrounding tissue occurs near the negative pole and can cause local hydrolysis, hydroxide accumulation, and corrosive tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/3,14,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,18-20</a>]. Discharged batteries still retain enough voltage and storage capability to generate an external current. Thus, ingestion of &quot;dead&quot; button batteries is still a major concern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The corrosive injury caused by electrical discharge cannot be differentiated from that caused by leakage of battery contents. However, this mechanism appears of primary importance for the following reasons:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In an in vitro study, after less than one minute, the electric discharge from a battery generated enough sodium hydroxide at and near the anode to raise the pH to 11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Several case reports describe increased severity of mucosal injury near the negative pole of batteries removed from the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Major complications (eg, esophageal burns, fistula, or perforation) and deaths are associated with lithium batteries which contain higher voltage (3 volts) and capacitance than most other button batteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The percent erosion of the crimp seal after 24 hours was directly related to the amount of charge remaining in the battery, with complete crimp dissolution in fully charged cells, 50 to 60 percent dissolution in 50 percent discharged cells, 10 to 20 percent dissolution in 75 percent discharged cells, and only minor pitting in the fully discharged cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alkaline solutions</strong> &ndash; As the alkaline solutions (potassium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sodium hydroxide) react with the exposed proteins on the mucosal surface of the GI tract, they may cause liquefaction necrosis and saponification of lipid membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Patients with a history of esophageal anomalies, strictures, esophagitis (particularly eosinophilic esophagitis), or surgery may have impactions at sites that do not correspond to physiologic narrowing.

When the ingestion is an incidental finding on plain radiograph, it may be difficult to differentiate between a button battery and a coin. This distinction is essential to proper management, especially when the foreign body is in the esophagus, because batteries require emergent removal whereas coins may or may not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Foreign bodies of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract in children&quot;, section on 'Coins'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The characteristic features of button batteries versus coins are as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Button batteries have a bilaminar structure, making them appear as a double-ring or halo on plain radiographs. The double-ring shadow helps to differentiate battery from coin ingestions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62847\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62847 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>On lateral view of the foreign body, the button battery has a step-off at the separation between the anode and cathode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77690\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77690 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Misidentifying the foreign body as a coin when it is actually a battery can have significant adverse consequences. As an example, an 11-month-old infant incurred bilateral vocal cord paralysis when a button battery was misread as a coin on plain radiographs; she remained intubated for six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estimation of battery size</strong> &ndash; Although size of an object cannot be reliably predicted based upon radiographs, objects greater than 50 mm in length or 20 mm in diameter are less likely to pass into the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Findings of esophageal perforation</strong> &ndash; Although rarely seen in children with esophageal button battery impaction, findings suggestive of an esophageal perforation on chest radiograph include mediastinal or free peritoneal air or subcutaneous emphysema. With cervical esophageal perforations, plain films of the neck may show air in the soft tissues of the prevertebral space. Other findings suggestive of an esophageal perforation include pleural effusions, mediastinal widening, hydrothorax, hydropneumothorax, or subdiaphragmatic air. However, plain radiographs are an insensitive means for establishing the presence of esophageal perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/button-and-cylindrical-battery-ingestion-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-initial-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h4\">Esophageal impaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that patients with button batteries that are lodged in the esophagus undergo <strong>emergent removal </strong>with direct endoscopic visualization by an appropriate specialist (eg, in children, a pediatric gastroenterologist, otolaryngologist, or surgeon).

(See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with severe injury (grade 2B or 3 [deep ulcers or necrosis]) warrant evaluation for stricture formation. The typical approach is to perform a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagogram four to six weeks after the ingestion or sooner if the patient develops dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Patients with mild to moderate injury are also at risk for stricture formation and warrant repeat clinical evaluation and imaging if symptoms develop. The peak incidence of dysphagia after corrosive esophageal injury is two months, although it can occur as early as two weeks or as late as years after ingestion.
