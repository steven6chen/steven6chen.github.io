Doctors can replace both lungs, which is called a &quot;bilateral lung transplant.&quot; This type of surgery is done most often. Doctors can also replace only 1 lung, which is called a &quot;single lung transplant.&quot;</p><p>Other types of lung transplant are less common. This includes getting a part of a lung from a family member or friend. In rare cases, people get a bilateral lung transplant and a heart transplant at the same time.</p><p>The type of lung transplant you have depends on your lung disease and individual situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590589259\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might I have a lung transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lung transplant is done to treat severe lung disease. Different lung conditions can lead to severe lung disease, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, called &quot;COPD&quot; for short</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary fibrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic fibrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hypertension</p><p/><p>Before you have a lung transplant, your doctor will try all other treatments first. Your doctor will recommend a lung transplant only if all other treatments fail and your lung disease is so severe it could be fatal in the next 1 to 2 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590589274\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens before I can get a lung transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you can get a lung transplant, you need to go through a number of steps.</p><p>Your doctor will send you to a lung transplant center (a hospital that does lung transplants). At the transplant center, you will have exams and tests. You and your family will also talk with different doctors. They will ask about your:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medical conditions and the medicines you take</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle (for example, whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family and other support system</p><p/><p>Not everyone who is sent to a lung transplant center will get a transplant. To be considered for a lung transplant, you need to meet certain conditions. For example, you need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have very severe lung disease that hasn't gotten better with other treatments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not have certain infections or medical conditions, such as cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agree to not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs, which can harm your new lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agree to take medicines for the rest of your life after surgery</p><p/><p>If you meet all of these conditions, you will be put on a waiting list for new lungs. An organization called &quot;UNOS&quot; keeps track of everyone on the list. UNOS tries to give lungs to the sickest people first. Your doctors will let UNOS know if your disease gets worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590589289\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do on my own to prepare for a lung transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can stay as healthy as possible. To stay as healthy as possible, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get regular exercise &ndash; This will help keep your breathing and other muscles strong. Most people need to do a &quot;pulmonary rehab&quot; program. In pulmonary rehab, you will learn exercises and ways to breathe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet &ndash; This will keep your body strong. To help your surgery and recovery go more smoothly, you should also keep your body at a healthy weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get the shots (vaccines) your doctor recommends &ndash; This includes a yearly flu shot. It also includes a shot called the pneumococcal vaccine. These shots can help prevent infections that can further damage your lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking &ndash; You will need to have stopped smoking for a certain amount of time before you can get on the UNOS list.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590589304\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens when lungs become available?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When lungs become available, UNOS chooses the person who is the best match for them. People who are waiting for a transplant need to carry a cell phone or pager at all times so that they can be reached quickly.</p><p>When you get called for your lung transplant, you will need to get to the hospital quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590589319\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a lung transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, most people stay in the hospital for a few weeks before going home. In the hospital and at home, your doctors will monitor you and do tests to make sure your new lungs are working correctly. Tests usually include breathing tests, chest X-rays, blood tests, and a procedure called bronchoscopy. During bronchoscopy, a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera and light on the end (called a &quot;bronchoscope&quot;) to look in your airways.</p><p>After a lung transplant, people need to take medicines called &quot;anti-rejection medicines.&quot; These medicines prevent the body's immune (infection-fighting) system from rejecting the new lungs. Normally, the immune system fights infections. It also attacks foreign substances, such as blood that is not your type or new lungs. The anti-rejection medicines will help keep your body from attacking your new lungs.</p><p>Even though anti-rejection medicines help, they also have side effects of their own. They make it difficult for your body to fight off infections. Because of this, you will also need to take antibiotics to prevent infections.</p><p>The specific anti-rejection medicines and antibiotics you take can change over time. But you will need to take anti-rejection medicines for the rest of your life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590589334\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can people have after a lung transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, people do well after surgery. They can go to work and be active. But a lung transplant is major surgery. Some people have problems after a lung transplant. Some people do not even survive the surgery. The problems that can happen after a lung transplant can happen right after the surgery or a few years later. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rejection of the new lungs &ndash; Even though people take anti-rejection medicines, their body might still reject and attack the new lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A narrowing or blockage in an airway</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood clot in the lungs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections in the lungs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects from the anti-rejection medicines &ndash; These medicines can increase your chance of getting infections and certain types of cancer. They also can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and kidney or liver problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The original lung disease returning</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590589349\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cystic fibrosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-hypertension-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pulmonary hypertension (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breathing-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breathing tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
