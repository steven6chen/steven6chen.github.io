The resulting aganglionic segment of the colon fails to relax, causing a functional obstruction. In the majority of patients, the disorder affects a short segment of the distal colon and rectum, with a transition zone in the rectosigmoid. In other patients, the aganglionosis involves longer segments of the colon; in rare cases, the entire colon and parts of the small bowel may also be involved.</p><p>HD occurs in approximately 1 in 5000 live births, with an overall male:female ratio of 3:1 to 4:1. When the entire colon is involved, the gender ratio more nearly approaches 1:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. &#160;</p><p>This topic review focuses on emergency complications of HD, the most important of which are mechanical intestinal obstruction and Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC). In most cases, mechanical obstruction and HAEC can be treated nonoperatively while the diagnostic work-up is completed. However, it is important to remember that those patients with these presenting problems who do not improve with nonoperative treatment will likely need a laparotomy and diverting colostomy or ileostomy depending on the level of the transition zone. Colonic volvulus, a rare complication, also is discussed. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical management of HD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE OBSTRUCTION IN THE NEONATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HD accounts for a substantial proportion of cases of neonatal bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Neonates who become symptomatic during the first few days of life typically present with failure to pass meconium (present in about 95 percent of neonates with HD), abdominal distension and tenderness, poor feeding, vomiting (which may be bilious or feculent), and other signs of intestinal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Their clinical condition may deteriorate rapidly unless they are treated promptly. Most newborns with HD can be resuscitated and stabilized by nonoperative means, allowing for a full diagnostic work-up and definitive elective surgery. Emergency surgery is seldom needed, and exploratory laparotomy in undiagnosed cases of HD is to be avoided. Those who present later in infancy have similar symptoms, but are less likely to develop acute obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, neonates and infants with undiagnosed HD may present with Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), which is discussed below. The clinical presentation includes fever, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal distension, and diarrhea; an explosion of gas and liquid stool may occur following digital rectal examination. Because HD is increasingly diagnosed in the first few months of life, fewer children present with HAEC than in the past. Most cases of HAEC now occur after a pull-through procedure, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Enterocolitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of HD is suggested by a plain film of the abdomen, showing an airless rectum, a cone-shaped transition zone (the presence of which is diagnostic of HD), and dilation of the segment of colon immediately proximal to the aganglionic segment, best seen on lateral view. These findings are more clearly demonstrated by a barium or water-soluble contrast enema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59877\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59877 \">image 1</a>) (performed &quot;unprepped,&quot; ie, without prior bowel evacuation), which should be done in any patient in whom the diagnosis of HD is suspected. The diagnosis should be confirmed by suction rectal biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to these findings, infants with mechanical obstruction have marked bowel dilation, which may extend to the small bowel. Rarely, there may be evidence of perforation, which tends to occur in the cecum. Perforation is most likely to occur in patients with long-segment disease who do not improve with gastric drainage, rectal irrigations, etc. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of infants presenting with acute distal intestinal obstruction includes meconium ileus, intestinal atresia and stenosis, anorectal malformation, duplication cyst, meconium plug syndrome, and neonatal small left colon syndrome. Calcifications usually suggest meconium ileus or atresia, but have also been reported with long-segment HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with HD seldom need to be brought to surgery urgently, even when they present with acute obstruction or HAEC. Neonates and infants with acute obstructive symptoms, and any child presenting with HAEC, should be resuscitated and stabilized with intravenous fluids, nasogastric or orogastric suction, broad spectrum antibiotics, twice daily rectal irrigations, and daily digital rectal examinations. Once stabilized, the patient should have a full diagnostic work-up, including a contrast enema and rectal biopsy to establish the diagnosis of HD. It should be noted, however, that the rectal manipulation from digital examinations or irrigation may occasionally decompress the bowel so effectively that it can cause the contrast enema to appear normal in patients with HD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>By stabilizing the patient and fully establishing the diagnosis prior to surgery, newly diagnosed cases can be treated with a one stage definitive pull-through rather than a diverting colostomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>In a minority of neonates with HD, the clinical manifestations do not resolve with the nonoperative measures noted above. When abdominal distention and tenderness persist and plain films show persistent dilation of the bowel, especially in the cecum and ascending colon, surgical intervention is indicated to relieve the obstruction and prevent perforation. This will almost always entail a diverting colostomy or ileostomy, ideally guided by use of frozen section pathology to localize the transition zone by confirming the presence of ganglion cells. Failure to relieve the obstruction is also the main cause of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Enterocolitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTEROCOLITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is the most severe and potentially lethal complication of HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With advances in technique and medical care during the past 50 years, mortality rates for HAEC have decreased from as high as 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] to less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. The incidence of HAEC ranges from 24 to 34 percent in different series of patients with HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Failure to recognize HD in the early perinatal period increases the risk for HAEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>HAEC can occur prior to surgical intervention (eg, in a neonate), in the immediate postoperative period, or even years after definitive repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>]. Postoperative HAEC usually occurs soon after definitive pull-through repair, ranging from 3 weeks to 20 months postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In one study, HAEC developed in 33 of 105 postoperative patients (32 percent), at a mean of eight months after repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients usually present with explosive foul-smelling diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain and distension.

Rectal bleeding and shock may be present in severe cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) has developed a decision support tool for diagnosis and severity grading, based on history, physical examination, and imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Findings specifically associated with HAEC include distension of the proximal colon and the &quot;cut-off sign&quot;, or absence of air in the distal rectosigmoid colon, with an abrupt cut-off at the level of the pelvic brim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18</a>]. A combination of the cut-off sign and at least two air-fluid levels has been strongly associated with a diagnosis of HAEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Diarrhea, explosive stools, abdominal distension, and radiologic evidence of bowel obstruction or mucosal edema are the most important clinical predictors of HAEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>In neonates, HD usually presents with signs and symptoms of mechanical obstruction.

Computed tomography (CT) has been described as showing thickening of the wall of the entire large bowel and terminal ileum, with enhancement of the mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms underlying HAEC are not fully understood.

HAEC is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, with reduced commensal bacteria (eg, bifidobacteria and lactobacillus); in some cases, pathogenic bacteria (eg, <em>C. difficile</em>) are isolated, and rotavirus and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> may also have a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/9,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22-25</a>]. The bowel wall in the affected area is subsequently invaded by colonic organisms, which can lead to pneumatosis intestinalis, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, systemic sepsis, shock, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>].</p><p>Pathologic examination of involved colonic tissue reveals neutrophils within the crypts of the mucosa, with mucin retention, abscess formation, and, in the most severe cases, transluminal necrosis and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, the trend is to resuscitate and stabilize the patient using the nonoperative measures noted above so that a definitive one-stage repair can be accomplished. Surgical resection and colostomy are indicated in the presence of ischemic bowel, frank perforation, or failure to improve with nonoperative measures, which include nasogastric or orogastric decompression, intravenous antibiotics, and rectal irrigations.

Some experts have advocated for routine use of rectal irrigations in infants with HD who are at increased risk for developing HAEC, such as those with Down syndrome, long-segment HD, or prior episodes of HAEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the utility of this approach has not been established, and this is not widely used. In one study, rectal irrigations for six months after surgical repair significantly decreased the incidence and severity of HAEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Similar results were found in a separate study combining rectal irrigations and bowel decontamination with antimicrobial agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

It has been described in children and adults with previously undiagnosed short-segment HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>], and occasionally in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The volvulus usually involves the sigmoid colon, and less commonly, the transverse or cecal segments. The cause is thought to be related to torsion of an enlarged colonic segment filled with meconium or feces. Excessive mobility of the sigmoid mesentery may also have a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In one series, two of 11 consecutive children presenting with volvulus had underlying HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. HD should be suspected in patients in children presenting with otherwise unexplained colonic volvulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/39,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42,43</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations are similar to those seen in patients with volvulus caused by other conditions, including abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting (which may or may not be bilious). Typically, patients also have historical features, such as failure to pass meconium (in the neonate) or chronic constipation (in older children), suggesting the underlying disease.</p><p>The diagnosis is suggested on plain abdominal radiographs, which will reveal distended intestinal loops and air-fluid levels consistent with obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a contrast enema, which may also de-torse the volvulus. Intravenous fluids and antibiotics should be administered. Surgery is indicated if detorsion is unsuccessful or if bowel necrosis or perforation is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hirschsprung-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Hirschsprung disease (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HD is a common cause of neonatal bowel obstruction. Neonates who become symptomatic during the first few days of life typically present with failure to pass meconium, abdominal distension, vomiting (which may be bilious or feculent), and other signs of intestinal obstruction. Most can be treated nonoperatively with gastric drainage and rectal irrigations while awaiting the results of the contrast enema and suction rectal biopsy. Rarely, surgery will be required when the obstruction does not improve. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute obstruction in the neonate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is the most severe and potentially lethal complication of HD. It can occur prior to surgical intervention (preoperative HAEC), in the immediate postoperative period, or long after definitive repair (postoperative HAEC). Young infants and those with Down syndrome are at increased risk for HAEC. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Enterocolitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HAEC usually present with explosive foul-smelling diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain and distension, and sometimes rectal bleeding and shock. Mild cases may be misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis. Therefore, HAEC should be considered in any child known to have HD presenting with symptoms suggestive of gastroenteritis. Radiographs show an obstructive picture, with air-fluid levels and dilated and edematous bowel loops. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of HAEC includes volume resuscitation and intravenous antibiotics. Repeated rectal irrigation with saline decompresses the colon and may decrease the severity of disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants presenting with HAEC prior to definitive surgery for HD should be stabilized, then treated with surgical resection of the aganglionic segment. Emergency surgery and a diverting ileostomy or colostomy are rarely necessary, except in the presence of ischemic bowel or a frank perforation, or failure to improve with nonoperative treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postoperative HAEC generally responds to antibiotics and irrigation, and rarely requires surgical intervention. Patients with recurrent or refractory postoperative HAEC should be evaluated for mechanical obstruction or a residual aganglionic segment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volvulus is a rare complication of previously undiagnosed short-segment HD. The cause is thought to be related to torsion of an enlarged colonic segment filled with meconium or feces. Clinical manifestations are similar to those seen in patients with volvulus caused by other conditions, including abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Volvulus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H311988181\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Erin E Endom, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Suita S, Taguchi T, Ieiri S, Nakatsuji T.
