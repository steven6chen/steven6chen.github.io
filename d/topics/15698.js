Having sickle cell trait means that you got an abnormal gene for a disease called &quot;sickle cell anemia&quot; from either your father or your mother. But to actually have the disease, you must get an abnormal gene from <strong>both</strong> parents. People with sickle cell trait can pass the abnormal gene to their children. A child might get the abnormal gene or might not. If the child gets the gene, he or she could have sickle cell trait or sickle cell anemia, depending on what gene he or she gets from the other parent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F95000\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95000 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The sickle cell gene is more common in people of certain ethnic backgrounds or parts of the world. It is most common in people from countries in Africa, the Middle East, India, South America, or the Mediterranean area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446958135\"><span class=\"h1\">What is sickle cell anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sickle cell anemia is a disease that can cause pain and many other medical problems. It happens to people who got the sickle cell gene from both parents. The condition affects a protein called hemoglobin, which is found inside red blood cells. Hemoglobin's job is to carry oxygen to the body's tissues.</p><p>Red blood cells that have normal hemoglobin are round and can easily move through all of the blood vessels. Red blood cells in people who have sickle cell anemia are not round. They have a twisted shape (like a crescent or an old-time tool called a &quot;sickle&quot;). The abnormal red blood cells get stuck in the blood vessels easily, and so they don't bring enough oxygen to the body's organs.</p><p>Other abnormal genes, besides the sickle cell gene, can affect hemoglobin. People who inherit one of these genes plus the sickle cell gene can have other forms of &quot;sickle cell diseases.&quot; One example is called &quot;sickle-beta thalassemia.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446958148\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of sickle cell trait?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sickle cell trait usually doesn't cause any symptoms at all. The only way most people know they have sickle cell trait is if they have a blood test for it. Even though it is not a disease, under certain conditions sickle cell trait can cause some problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney cancer (in very rare cases)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots, especially under extreme conditions, such as when climbing very tall mountains or when scuba diving</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446958161\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for sickle cell trait?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there is a blood test that can show if a person has sickle cell trait. In the United States, all newborn babies are tested for sickle cell anemia before they leave the hospital. This test can also show sickle cell trait, but parents are not always told if their child has sickle cell trait.</p><p>Doctors test for sickle cell trait in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have sickle cell anemia (or another type of sickle cell or hemoglobin disease) in the family, and are planning to have a baby &ndash; This helps them find out how likely it is that their child will have sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults or teens with symptoms that could be related to sickle cell trait or sickle cell anemia &ndash; Symptoms include blood in the urine, long-lasting erections (in boys or men), blood clots, or unexplained bleeding in the eye.</p><p/><p>Military and sports organizations have their own rules about testing for sickle cell trait.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446958174\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I should do on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have sickle cell trait, be careful when you exercise intensely or for a long time. Make sure you drink enough fluids, do not get too overheated, and pay attention to any symptoms you might develop.</p><p>Some people believe that having sickle cell trait makes a person more likely to have rare, serious medical problems during intense exercise. The risk for people with sickle cell trait is being studied and is not something all experts agree on. Whether or not people with sickle cell trait are at increased risk, the fact is that all people should drink enough and try to stay cool when they exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446958187\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to have children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to have children, talk with your doctor. Your doctor might recommend that you be tested for sickle cell trait. You might also see someone called a &quot;genetic counselor.&quot; Genetic counselors are experts at helping people understand health problems that run in families.</p><p>Your doctor or a genetic counselor can tell you your baby's chance of having sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, and whether your partner will need to be tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446958200\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-child-has-sickle-cell-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your child has sickle cell disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sickle cell disease (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
