The great majority of ichthyoses are inherited, but acquired forms can develop in the setting of malignancy, autoimmune or infectious disease, and nutritional deficiency. </p><p>The molecular basis and pathophysiology of most inherited ichthyoses has been clarified by the identification of causative mutations in over 50 genes encoding structural proteins or enzymes involved in a broad variety of cellular functions, from DNA repair to skin barrier homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Abnormalities in any of these components result in a rather stereotypic epidermal response with epidermal hyperplasia and the formation of excess stratum corneum accompanied by abnormal desquamation and visible accumulation of scales on the skin's surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the major types of inherited ichthyoses, utilizing the consensus nomenclature adopted by the 2009 Ichthyosis Consensus Conference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Paraneoplastic ichthyosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-internal-malignancy#H28414251\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy&quot;, section on 'Acquired ichthyosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65591761\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ichthyosis vulgaris and X-linked ichthyosis are the most common types of ichthyosis, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 250 births and 1:6000 male births, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses, which include lamellar ichthyosis, congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, and harlequin ichthyosis, are rare; their overall incidence has been estimated at approximately 1 in 200,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16647205\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE EPIDERMIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average adult skin surface area is 1.8 m<sup>2</sup> and contains nearly 85 billion nucleated cells, requiring daily generation of three billion keratinocytes to achieve simple replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This cellular demand is met by a population of keratinocyte stem cells that cycle slowly to generate the mitotically active cells of the basal layer of the epidermis, which enter into a pathway of terminal differentiation. </p><p>Regulated by precise temporal and spatial gene expression, keratinocyte differentiation results in a series of changes within an individual cell as it completes its approximately 28-day long course from the basal layer to stratum corneum. This cycle requires the synthesis of site-relevant proteins, including adhesion and structural proteins, and also of cholesterol and other components necessary for the generation of the lipid barrier. </p><p>In the basal layer, cells produce extracellular matrix proteins that ensure strong adhesion to the underlying dermis and also synthesize basal-layer specific keratins 5 and 14, which are members of a family of intermediate filaments responsible for keratinocyte structural integrity. With progression to the spinous layer, cells cease dividing and begin expressing a series of differentiation-specific proteins. These include new keratins 1 and 10, as well as the building blocks for a lipid-based barrier (ie, glucosylceramides, phospholipids, and free sterols) packaged into specialized organelles known as lamellar bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the granular layer, additional protein components necessary for the generation of an extensively cross-linked cornified envelope are synthesized and packaged into keratohyalin granules. </p><p>In the transition from granular layer to stratum corneum, keratinocytes enter into the cornification pathway, in which the cell becomes anucleate and enzymatic crosslinks are formed between structural proteins (eg, involucrin, loricrin, envoplakin) and keratin intermediate filament network. At this stage, a lipid envelope is extruded into the intercellular space from lamellar bodies to form lipid sheets composed of ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This process leads to the generation of a lipid-rich stratum corneum consisting primarily of corneocytes, which are flat, polyhedral, anucleate cells composed of crosslinked protein. Through incompletely understood pathways that involve the action of proteases, corneocyte adhesion is modified, permitting desquamation at the surface of the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16647226\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2009 consensus classification, based upon the clinical phenotype, mode of inheritance, and molecular defect, recognizes two main groups of ichthyoses: nonsyndromic forms, in which the phenotypic expression of the disorder is seen only in the skin; and syndromic forms, in which other organs or systems are involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90504%7EDERM%2F90509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90504 graphicRef90509 \">table 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It is caused by loss of function mutations in the filaggrin gene (<em>FLG</em>) and is inherited in an autosomal semi-dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Individuals with one mutated allele have a mild phenotype, whereas those with mutations in both manifest severe disease. Histologically, ichthyosis vulgaris is characterized by a reduction of keratohyalin granules or absence of the granular layer.</p><p>Clinical findings include fine white to gray scaling which is most prominent on the abdomen and extensor surfaces of the extremities, with sparing of the flexures and face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61258%7EDERM%2F68882%7EDERM%2F79894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61258 graphicRef68882 graphicRef79894 \">picture 1A-C</a>). The palms and soles show increased skin markings or hyperlinearity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90481\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90481 \">picture 2</a>). Keratosis pilaris (keratotic elevations around the hair follicles), most prominent on the upper arms and legs, is present in many patients. There is a marked seasonal variation in severity, with improvement in warm and sunny weather with high degree of ambient humidity and worsening in dry and cold weather. Ichthyosis vulgaris is associated with an increased risk for atopy, including asthma, allergies, and atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>Treatment with emollients, humectants, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> keratolytics is typically sufficient to ameliorate symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16647240\"><span class=\"h3\">X-linked recessive ichthyosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>X-linked recessive ichthyosis (XLRI, MIM #308100) typically affects male offspring who inherit an X chromosome bearing a mutated gene from their asymptomatic carrier mother. XLRI is caused by mutations in the <em>STS </em>gene on Xp22.3, encoding steroid sulfatase, which hydrolyzes sulfate esters, including cholesterol sulfate and sulfated steroid hormones. In most cases, mutations are complete gene deletions, whereas simple point mutations occur in approximately 10 percent of cases. Rarely, deletions extend to adjacent genes and lead to contiguous gene syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H5888311\" class=\"local\">'Contiguous gene syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p>XLRI presents with generalized peeling in the neonatal period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66723 \">picture 3A</a>) and fine scaling on the trunk and extremities in infancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90658\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90658 \">picture 3B</a>). Over time, scales become more platelike and adherent with a brownish hue. The popliteal and antecubital fossae and central face are spared, but the axillae and lateral neck are often involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90659\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90659 \">picture 3C</a>). Frequently, XLRI is clinically indistinguishable from ichthyosis vulgaris. </p><p>Asymptomatic corneal opacities in Descemet's membrane occur in approximately 50 percent of adult patients and up to 25 percent of asymptomatic carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Children with XLRI may have an increased risk of cryptorchidism and an increased risk of testicular cancer unrelated to undescended testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of XLRI are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Of these disorders, HI is the most clinically distinct and genetically homogeneous entity, resulting from loss of function mutations in <em>ABCA12</em>. In contrast, LI and CIE represent a spectrum of disorders due to mutations in <em>TGM1</em>, <em>ALOXE3</em>, <em>ALOX12B</em>, <em>NIPAL4</em>, <em>CYP4F22</em>, <em>ABCA12</em>, <em>PNPLA1</em>,<em> </em>and other yet unidentified genes. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been possible in these disorders, since mutation in the same genes may present with widely divergent phenotypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62154308\"><span class=\"h3\">Lamellar ichthyosis and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although initially considered separate entities, lamellar ichthyosis (LI, MIM #242300) and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE, MIM #242100) show clinical and genetic overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Most cases are caused by mutations in one of several genes, including <em>TGM1</em>,<em> NIPAL4</em>,<em> ALOX12B</em>,<em> ALOXE3</em>,<em> ABCA12</em>, <em>PNPLA1</em>,<em> </em>and <em>CYP4F22 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. </p><p>LI and CIE typically present at birth with a collodion membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62827\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62827 \">picture 4</a>), a tight translucent membrane covering the newborn's body that sheds in the first few weeks of life with emollient application. In LI, the collodion membrane is replaced by thick hyperkeratosis with dark, plate-like adherent scales. Ectropion is prominent and palmoplantar keratoderma (thickening of the palms and soles) of varying severity is usually present. The hyperkeratosis may impair the sweat gland function, resulting in hypohidrosis. In CIE, scaling tends to be milder than in LI, with variable erythroderma and ectropion. </p><p>Early management is centered on supportive care, including prevention of infection, management of hydration and nutrition, and ophthalmologic care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Emollients are the mainstay of treatment to control scaling and improve the skin barrier function. Topical retinoids can be useful in reducing scale in localized areas. </p><p>For severe scaling, oral retinoids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isotretinoin</a>, are an important therapeutic option. Oral retinoids are known teratogens. Appropriate counseling and contraception must be given to women of childbearing age. In addition, the consequences of long-term or lifelong therapy must also be weighed. Adverse effects of long-term retinoid therapy include premature closure of the epiphyses, calcification of tendons and ligaments, development of skeletal hyperostosis, and osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590395\"><span class=\"h3\">Harlequin ichthyosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Harlequin ichthyosis (HI; MIM #242500) is a severe disorder of keratinization caused by loss of function mutations in <em>ABCA12</em>; less severe mutations result in a collodion membrane and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma-like presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. <em>ABCA12</em> is an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and is a member of a large family of proteins that hydrolyze ATP to transport cargo across membranes. <em>ABCA12</em> is thought to be a lipid transporter in keratinocytes necessary for lipid transport into lamellar granules during the formation of the lipid barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Newborns with HI present with thick, fissured armor-plate hyperkeratosis, severe ectropion (eversion of the eyelids), eclabium (eversion of the lips), and malformation of the auricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F94396\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94396 \">picture 5</a>). Early complications result from infection due to fissuring of the hyperkeratotic plates and respiratory distress due to physical restriction of chest wall expansion.</p><p>Management includes supportive care and treatment of hyperkeratosis and skin barrier dysfunction. Intubation is often required until nares are patent. Nutritional support with tube feeds is essential until eclabium resolves and infants can begin nursing. Ophthalmology consultation can be helpful in the early management of ectropion, which is initially pronounced and resolves as scale is shed. Liberal application of petrolatum is performed multiple times daily. To avoid digital ischemia, careful debridement of constrictive bands of hyperkeratosis should be performed. </p><p>Prior reports suggest that the mortality rate in the neonatal period is approximately 50 percent, and many infants with HI die shortly after birth, but improved neonatal intensive care and early treatment with oral retinoids may improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Children who survive the neonatal period usually evolve to a less severe phenotype, resembling a severe congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma.

Newborn with keratinization disorders have a compromised barrier function, which is associated with increased transepidermal water loss, hypernatremic dehydration, and increased heat loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-classification-of-the-inherited-ichthyoses/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Close monitoring for infection is mandatory. Bland emollients such as petrolatum should be applied regularly. They replace in part the barrier function, permit shedding of accumulated scale, and provide a proper environment for healing of fissures or erosions. </p><p>Early consultation with a multidisciplinary team is required in the most severe cases.
