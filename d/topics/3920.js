The term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) has been used to describe a clinical syndrome of biliary or pancreatic obstruction related to mechanical or functional abnormalities of the sphincter of Oddi.</p><p>The literature regarding SOD is often difficult to interpret because of differences in nomenclature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The terms papillary stenosis, sclerosing papillitis, biliary spasm, biliary dyskinesia, and postcholecystectomy syndrome have been used synonymously with SOD. Despite this source of confusion, two separate pathologic entities are widely recognized based upon their distinct pathogenic mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sphincter of Oddi stenosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia</p><p/><p>The term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction encompasses both sphincter of Oddi stenosis and sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia.</p><p>SOD has been associated with two clinical syndromes: biliary pain and idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis. Idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis is defined as two or more attacks of well documented acute pancreatitis of unclear cause despite an exhaustive work-up (laboratory and noninvasive imaging) with complete resolution of clinical and laboratory findings between attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence that SOD can cause acute pancreatitis was suggested in an animal model in which transient sphincter contraction induced by application of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbachol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbachol</a> abolished trans-sphincteric flow and increased pancreatic exocrine secretion and pancreatic duct pressure to levels comparable with those seen in pancreatic duct ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The addition of <span class=\"nowrap\">cholecystokinin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a></span> stimulation of pancreatic secretion plus carbachol application caused pancreatic tissue damage and an increase in serum amylase levels.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. The treatment of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, other causes of postcholecystectomy syndrome, and functional gallbladder disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-cholecystectomy#H689178094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;, section on 'Postcholecystectomy syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-gallbladder-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional gallbladder disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sphincter of Oddi is composed of small circular and longitudinal muscular segments that are approximately 6 to 10 mm in total length and are contained mostly within the wall of the duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78786 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The muscle fibers surround the intraduodenal segment of the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63728\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63728 \">picture 1</a>). A circular aggregate of muscle fibers known as the sphincter choledochus (or sphincter of Boyden) maintains resistance to bile flow and thereby permits filling of the gallbladder during fasting and prevents retrograde reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary tree. A separate structure, the sphincter pancreaticus, encircles the distal pancreatic duct. The muscle fibers of the sphincter pancreaticus are interlocked with those of the sphincter choledochus in a figure eight pattern. Although the pancreatic and biliary sphincter portions of the sphincter of Oddi can be distinguished anatomically, their manometric features are similar, and a direct anatomic and manometric correlation has not been established.</p><p>The muscle fibers of the sphincter of Oddi function independently from those of the duodenal musculature. The motility of the sphincter of Oddi is complex and not completely understood, but it is known to vary in the fasting and fed states.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During fasting, sphincter of Oddi motility is integrated with the migrating motor complex (MMC), permitting coordinated release of bile into the duodenum. The MMC is the pattern of gastrointestinal motor activity present during fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is divided into three phases: phase I is a quiescent period and lasts 45 to 60 minutes; phase II is comprised of random intermittent contractions and lasts approximately 30 minutes; phase III is a period of bursts of rapid, evenly-paced, uninterrupted peristaltic contractions and lasts for 5 to 15 minutes. Myoelectrical potentials within the sphincter of Oddi increase during phase I of the MMC, reach a maximum during phase III, and then decrease rapidly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the fed state, myoelectrical potentials within the sphincter of Oddi vary depending upon the type and quantity of nutrients ingested and may be influenced by endogenous hormones such as cholecystokinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63642734\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sphincter of Oddi stenosis is an anatomic abnormality associated with narrowing of the sphincter of Oddi. It can result from any process leading to inflammation or scarring, such as pancreatitis, passage of a gallstone through the papilla, intraoperative trauma, infection, and adenomyosis. Sphincter of Oddi stenosis is associated with abnormal sphincter of Oddi motility and elevated basal pressure.</p><p>Sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia refers to a functional disturbance of the sphincter of Oddi, leading to intermittent biliary obstruction. The cause of sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia is not well understood. Spasm and relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi can be induced pharmacologically with agents known to affect smooth muscle function (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>), suggesting that the spasm may be influenced by local hormonal or neurologic disturbance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16563228\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) among patients with biliary pain or idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis is difficult to estimate because of several potential sources of bias among studies evaluating SOD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of investigation for other causes of symptoms differed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic &quot;gold-standard&quot; for SOD varied</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of different manometry systems, which may lead to variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of adequate control groups in many studies because the diagnosis of SOD usually involves invasive testing </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The studies were performed in tertiary medical centers and are thus potentially vulnerable to referral bias</p><p/><p>However, available data suggest that both biliary and pancreatic SOD occur more often in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of 5430 participants from randomly sampled US households, women were significantly more likely to have functional biliary pain than men (2.3 versus 0.6 percent, odds ratio 3.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second study of 49 patients with sphincter of Oddi stenosis and recurrent pancreatitis, 43 of the patients (88 percent) were female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The reasons for this are not well understood, but may be related to unmasking of pre-existing SOD due to removal of the gallbladder, which may have served as a reservoir to accommodate increased pressure in the biliary system occurring during sphincter spasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another possible explanation is that there is alteration of sphincter of Oddi motility because of the severing of nerve fibers that pass between the gallbladder and the sphincter of Oddi via the cystic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, SOD also occurs in patients whose gallbladders are intact, suggesting that other pathophysiologic mechanisms are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Despite the association of SOD with cholecystectomy, SOD is an uncommon occurrence following cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In one series of 454 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy, the prevalence of SOD was estimated to be less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Characteristics that are <strong>not</strong> suggestive of biliary SOD include lancinating pain that lasts for seconds, constant pain that lasts all day, pain that is exacerbated by eating, pain that is relieved by defecation, or pain that is associated with diarrhea. In addition, the pain is not relieved by anticholinergic antispasmodics, antacids, H2-blockers, or proton pump inhibitors.</p><p>Laboratory abnormalities may include elevations in the alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase that normalize between attacks.

The differential diagnosis of right upper quadrant or epigastric pain includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis due to other causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation for alternate diagnoses may include studies such as transabdominal ultrasound, abdominal computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, upper endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Which tests to pursue will depend upon their availability and the patient's clinical presentation. In addition, therapeutic trials of medications such as antispasmodics or proton pump inhibitors should be considered in patients with symptoms suggestive of possible irritable bowel syndrome or gastroesophageal <span class=\"nowrap\">reflux/functional</span> dyspepsia, respectively, prior to invasive testing for SOD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In general, only patients fulfilling the Rome IV criteria should undergo invasive evaluation for SOD. This decreases the chance of patients being inappropriately subjected to invasive testing for SOD that is associated significant complications (primarily pancreatitis). (See <a href=\"#H51500670\" class=\"local\">'Rome IV criteria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Sphincter of Oddi manometry'</a> below.)</p><p>To determine if patients fulfill the Rome IV criteria, liver tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) and pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase) should be checked, and structural abnormalities need to be excluded. Transabdominal ultrasound is typically the initial imaging study obtained for suspected biliary SOD. It can look for structural abnormalities such as gallstones while also providing an estimate of the common bile duct diameter. However, transabdominal ultrasound may not adequately visualize the pancreas because of overlying bowel gas, so alternate imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), may be required for evaluation of the pancreatic duct. Additional testing that may help to rule out structural abnormalities includes abdominal computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).</p><p>In appropriately selected patients, the diagnosis of SOD is established by sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM), which is performed during ERCP. Several less invasive methods have also been evaluated for establishing the diagnosis, but none has been shown to approach the diagnostic accuracy of SOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

The diagnosis may be supported by provocation tests or hepatobiliary scintigraphy, but definitive diagnosis requires SOM. (See <a href=\"#H51499802\" class=\"local\">'Specific diagnostic tests'</a> below.)</p><p>The Rome IV consensus conference statement suggests that in patients who have had a cholecystectomy, a reasonable approach is to start with liver and pancreatic biochemical tests, followed by an upper endoscopy and abdominal imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography scan, MRCP, or endoscopic ultrasound). </p><p>Subsequent evaluation in the patient with biliary-type pain depends on the presence of abnormal liver tests, and a dilated common bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Both abnormal liver tests and a dilated common bile duct</strong> &ndash; Patients with elevated liver tests and a dilated common bile duct likely have an underlying obstruction and do not require additional testing.

However, some authorities recommend empiric sphincterotomy in such patients, a strategy that was supported by a cost-effectiveness analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Our approach is to proceed with SOM in such patients, which is consistent with the Rome IV consensus statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

As a result, dilation of the common bile duct alone is insufficient evidence for establishing the diagnosis of SOD.

In particular, recordings from the pancreatic portion of the sphincter should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H16563979\" class=\"local\">'Functional pancreatic sphincter of Oddi disorder'</a> above and <a href=\"#H51500222\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of pancreatic SOD'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22517785\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Lyndon Hernandez, MD, MPH, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Tzovaras G, Rowlands BJ.
