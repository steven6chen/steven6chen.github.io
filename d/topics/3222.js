The majority of these cases are probably caused by other disorders, such as decidual <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/infection,</span> placental bleeding, or uterine overdistension. These other disorders can initiate biochemical changes in the cervix that lead to premature cervical shortening and often a single (ie, nonrecurrent) second-trimester <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/birth</span>.

The duration from recognition of symptoms to delivery may have been extremely short, and successive pregnancies may have been associated with progressively earlier delivery.</p><p>Cervical abnormalities, either congenital or as a result of trauma, are a risk factor for structural cervical weakness and, in turn, recurrent cervical insufficiency.

Discharge volume may increase; the color may change from clear, white, or light yellow to pink, tan, or red spotting; and the consistency may become thinner. Symptoms, if present, typically begin between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation and may be present for several days or weeks before the diagnosis of cervical insufficiency is made.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263423507\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early in the course of cervical insufficiency, the cervix may be soft and closed, with minimal effacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Provocative maneuvers such as suprapubic or fundal pressure or the Valsalva maneuver may reveal fetal membranes in the endocervical canal or vagina; this is always an abnormal finding. However, in some cases, membranes may be prolapsed or ruptured.

The presence of risk factors for structural cervical weakness supports the diagnosis. Most of these cases are pregnancy losses before 24 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H7413947\" class=\"local\">'Past history'</a> above.)</p><p>Challenges to making this diagnosis are that the relevant findings in the prior pregnancy are often not well-documented in medical records and the patient's recounting of events may not provide adequate information; thus, the process that led to the second trimester <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/birth</span> is often a subjective assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3673513060\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound-based diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In asymptomatic women with a past history of one second trimester pregnancy <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/extremely</span> preterm birth (ie, &lt;28 weeks) associated with no or minimal mild symptoms (see <a href=\"#H7413977\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above) and those in whom a history-based diagnosis is uncertain, we perform serial transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) examinations and make a diagnosis of cervical insufficiency when cervical length is &le;25 mm before 24 weeks. In these women, the author begins TVU measurement of cervical length at around 14 weeks, with repeat screening every two weeks until 24 weeks as long as cervical length is &ge;30 mm. If cervical length is 26 to 29 mm, he repeats screening weekly as long as the length remains in this range. TVU screening is discontinued at 24 weeks of gestation, as cerclage is rarely performed after this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The presence of risk factors for structural cervical insufficiency supports the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H7413947\" class=\"local\">'Past history'</a> above.)</p><p>This approach is supported by a 2011 meta-analysis of randomized trials of women with singleton gestations and prior preterm birth managed either by (1) cervical length screening with cerclage for short cervical length or (2) obstetrical history-indicated cerclage that showed both groups had similar rates of preterm birth before 37 weeks (31 versus 32 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.73-1.29), preterm birth before 34 weeks (17 versus 23 percent, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48-1.20), and perinatal mortality (5 versus 3 percent, RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.58-5.35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the ultrasound screening group, only 42 percent of patients developed a short cervical length and received cerclage whereas, in the history-indicated group, 100 percent of patients received a history-indicated cerclage. Thus, in patients with a history suggestive of cervical insufficiency, placement of a cerclage upon identification of a short cervix on ultrasound is effective in reducing preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], results in pregnancy outcomes comparable with history-indicated cerclage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and avoids cerclage in about 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>If a women in this population develops symptoms of cervical insufficiency (see <a href=\"#H7413977\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above), an ultrasound examination for cervical length should be performed promptly because a normal physical examination cannot reliably exclude the diagnosis of cervical insufficiency. Most cervices that are 10 to 25 mm in length by second-trimester TVU feel long and closed on physical examination; effacement and dilation are usually not detected until the transvaginal cervical length is &le;10 mm. In one study, less than one-third of women with cervical length &lt;11 mm had a cervical dilation &ge;1 cm on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1883517966\"><span class=\"h4\">Additional evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Labor should be excluded by tocodynamometry.

Subclinical intra-amniotic infection is diagnosed by laboratory examination of amniotic fluid, and is often indicated since many patients have significant cervical dilation, prolapsed membranes, or abnormal-appearing amniotic fluid.

Cerclage is not indicated in multiple gestations, given that the body of evidence shows no improvement in pregnancy outcome compared with appropriate controls without cerclage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;, section on 'Unproven interventions to prevent or delay preterm labor and delivery'</a>.)</p><p>Pretreatment evaluation is reviewed above.

Structural weakness of the cervix can be treated effectively with structural support from a cerclage. Anatomical, biochemical, and clinical evidence from observational studies and randomized trials consistently support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>At 16 weeks of gestation, the author also begins <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyprogesterone-caproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyprogesterone caproate</a> weekly and continues it until 36 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the routine use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate is controversial, in part because no randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of combination therapy (both history-indicated cerclage and hydroxyprogesterone caproate) in this patient population. One small retrospective study observed that combination therapy (cerclage and hydroxyprogesterone caproate) was more effective than cerclage alone for preventing delivery &lt;24 weeks but not &lt;28 or &lt;37 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The small (n = 33) number of noniatrogenic deliveries &lt;24 weeks precludes a clear conclusion about the efficacy of combined therapy. In addition, trials of use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women with a previous preterm birth were mostly limited to women whose delivery was at &ge;20 weeks of gestation, although some hydroxyprogesterone caproate trials included women at high risk for either midtrimester pregnancy loss or preterm birth. Thus, use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women with a history of pregnancy losses before 20 weeks is neither well supported nor refuted by available data.</p><p>Reasonable alternative approaches are to limit use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyprogesterone-caproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyprogesterone caproate</a> to women with previous preterm deliveries &ge;20 weeks of gestation or to avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> supplementation unless the cervical length falls to &le;25 mm and then begin vaginal progesterone supplementation.

A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that placement of a cerclage in this setting reduces preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth are prescribed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyprogesterone-caproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyprogesterone caproate</a> beginning at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation (which may be before or after cerclage placement) and continued through 36 weeks.</p><p>Some clinicians prescribe vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> in addition to cerclage since the body of evidence suggests vaginal progesterone is more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyprogesterone-caproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyprogesterone caproate</a> in women with a short cervix and no history of preterm birth.

Physical examination alone is adequate for diagnosis of cervical insufficiency in women with advanced cervical dilation. The diagnosis is usually limited to singleton gestations because the pathogenesis of second-trimester pregnancy <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/extremely</span> preterm delivery (ie, &lt;28 weeks) in multiple gestations is usually unrelated to a weakened cervix.

The presence of risk factors for structural cervical weakness support the diagnosis. Most of these cases are pregnancy losses before 24 weeks.

In these women, the author begins TVU measurement of cervical length at around 14 weeks, with repeat screening every two weeks until 24 weeks as long as cervical length is &ge;30 mm. If cervical length is 26 to 29 mm, he repeats screening weekly as long as the length remains in this range. TVU screening is discontinued at 24 weeks of gestation, as cerclage is rarely performed after this time. The presence of risk factors for structural cervical insufficiency supports the diagnosis.
