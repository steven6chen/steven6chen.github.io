Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) affects millions of women; approximately 200,000 inpatient surgical procedures for prolapse are performed annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Eleven to 19 percent of women will undergo surgery for POP or incontinence by age 80 to 85 years, and 30 percent of these women will require an additional POP or incontinence surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Anterior vaginal wall prolapse without concomitant apical prolapse is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and apical prolapse repair should be included in the majority of pelvic reconstructive surgery procedures. </p><p>Reconstructive procedures for prolapse of the vaginal apex are reviewed here. Evaluation of women with POP, conservative management, and choosing a primary surgical procedure are discussed separately. Obliterative procedures for POP (colpocleisis) are also discussed separately.

The clinical significance of apical descent that is not beyond the hymen is unclear, as half of asymptomatic women presenting for routine gynecologic care have prolapse to the hymen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, studies suggest that prolapse becomes symptomatic when the leading edge protrudes beyond the vaginal opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, isolated anterior vaginal wall defects are uncommon. Therefore, if the anterior vaginal wall protrudes beyond the hymen, the apex likely has inadequate support, as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14533665\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND MECHANISMS OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apical prolapse refers to the downward displacement of the vaginal apex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67287\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67287 \">figure 1</a>).

The risk of prolapse after hysterectomy was illustrated in a case-control study in which 160,000 women who underwent hysterectomy were significantly more likely than age-matched controls to require subsequent pelvic floor repair (3.2 verus 2.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Women who have prolapse at the time of hysterectomy have an even higher risk of subsequent surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). A case-control study of women who underwent hysterectomy reported that the risk of subsequent POP repair was 5-fold in those who had a history of vaginal delivery, 8-fold in those who had prior surgery for POP or urinary incontinence, and almost 13-fold in those who had grade 2 or higher prolapse at the time of hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In addition, pelvic organ prolapse (POP) often coexists with urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anal incontinence. During the history and physical examination, the presence and severity of each of these disorders should be assessed, as this information may alter surgical decision-making. </p><p>Aspects of preoperative evaluation and preparation that are specific to apical prolapse repair are discussed in this section. General principles of evaluation of women undergoing POP repair are discussed in detail separately.

This helps to set realistic goals for reconstructive surgery and assess postoperative improvement. Patient satisfaction after surgery for POP and urinary incontinence correlates highly with achievement of self-described preoperative surgical goals, but poorly with objective outcome measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p>Informed consent for repair of apical prolapse should include a discussion of the risk of persistent or recurrent prolapse at the apex, anterior, or posterior vaginal walls. Since some women develop stress urinary incontinence (SUI) following apical prolapse repair, surgeons should also discuss the risk of developing incontinence, as well as the risks and benefits of performing a prophylactic incontinence procedure versus deferring an incontinence procedure until symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of urinary dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>Other important items to discuss with women planning apical POP surgery include potential postoperative changes in sexual function and mesh-related complications if mesh will be used for the repair. In our practice, we counsel all women undergoing pelvic surgery that there is a risk of postoperative dyspareunia.

Protrusion of the vagina may result in vaginal discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding from ulceration. Other symptoms commonly reported by women with apical prolapse are voiding difficulty and constipation; some women need to reduce the prolapse using a finger in the vagina (ie, splint) to urinate or defecate. </p><p>Women with advanced anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse may have similar symptoms and pelvic examination is needed to ascertain the site(s) and stage of prolapse. Investigators demonstrated that restoration of the vaginal apex during prolapse examination fixes anterior vaginal wall defects 50 percent of the time and posterior vaginal wall defects 30 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough speculum and bimanual pelvic examination are performed. We perform apical prolapse assessment initially with the woman standing and straining. Each vaginal compartment (apical, anterior, and posterior) should then be examined with the women supine. The apical prolapse can be visualized during speculum examination with the woman straining as the speculum is slowly withdrawn from the upper third of the vagina. In some women with advanced apical prolapse, protrusion of the apex is visible at or beyond the vaginal introitus before the speculum is inserted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70607\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70607 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>Since isolated apical prolapse is rare, careful assessment of the anterior and posterior wall is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>The findings of the examination should be recorded using a quantitative and reproducible method for recording POP.

Women with POP but no SUI symptoms are challenging because they can have stage II or greater apical prolapse and remain continent despite loss of anterior vaginal and <span class=\"nowrap\">bladder/urethral</span> support but then become incontinent after POP repair. Studies have reported 13 to 65 percent of continent women develop symptoms of stress incontinence after surgical correction of the prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/7,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20-22</a>]. This likely occurs because the prolapse kinks and obstructs the urethra; this obstruction is alleviated when the prolapse is repaired. This is referred to as &quot;occult&quot; or &quot;potential&quot; stress incontinence. Women with stage I POP are unlikely to have urethral obstruction and resultant occult stress incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/7,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20-22</a>].</p><p>To detect occult incontinence, we perform a preoperative evaluation for occult stress incontinence during which the prolapse is reduced. Stress testing can be done via a basic office evaluation with full-bladder cough stress test or urodynamic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery#H6905662\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative patient care issues in female pelvic reconstructive surgery&quot;, section on 'Urodynamic studies'</a>.) </p><p>While we perform preoperative evaluation for occult SUI, we recognize that the ability of preoperative prolapse reduction testing to predict postoperative urinary incontinence is limited. In study of stress-continent women undergoing preoperative urodynamic testing prior to sacrocolpopexy, nearly 4 percent of women had urodynamic stress incontinence when the prolapse was not reduced, which increased to 27 percent of women with prolapse reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When all methods of prolapse reduction were combined, the positive and negative predictive values of preoperative prolapse reduction stress testing were 37 and 80 percent, respectively. While the positive predictive value of preoperative reduction stress tests is low, it appears to be helpful in surgical planning. In a multicenter trial of continent women undergoing vaginal prolapse repair who were randomly assigned to concomitant midurethral sling or sham incision, women with a positive cough stress test had more benefit from prophylactic sling than those without a positive stress test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

While there are fewer data regarding prophylactic surgery for stress incontinence in women undergoing transvaginal apical prolapse repair, it appears such preventive surgery is safe and effective in this population.

Key issues for discussion include the choice of surgical route (abdominal &ndash; open, laparoscopic, robotic &ndash; or vaginal) and the risks and benefits of that route, the need for repair of other pelvic defects, and the presence of urinary incontinence. In addition, women undergoing intraperitoneal surgery must further decide if they desire hysterectomy as part of the repair, elective or risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or prophylactic salpingectomy for ovarian cancer risk reduction.

Data suggest that abdominal surgery, typically with an abdominal sacral colpopexy (ASC), provides better objective anatomic outcomes than vaginal apical support procedures for most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. However, vaginal procedures are a reasonable alternative because of similar, and possibly reduced, rates of postoperative prolapse symptoms, reoperation, and adverse events compared with ASC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The uterus or fallopian tubes can be removed by either route. While the majority of studies on ASC outcomes used an open technique, laparoscopic and robot-assisted approaches are now more commonly performed. Laparoscopic and robotic approaches appear to offer the improved vaginal support associated with open procedures and the shorter recovery of vaginal procedures. One trial of 112 women randomly assigned to laparoscopic or open abdominal sacrocolpopexy reported no difference between the procedures for recurrence of apical prolapse (none in either group), surgical complications, or mesh exposures at a mean of 41 months of follow-up, although there were significantly more anterior compartment recurrences in the laparoscopic group compared with the abdominal group (18 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

A 2016 meta-analysis of 30 trials concluded that open sacrocolpopexy had superior outcomes compared with a variety of vaginal procedures, including sacrospinous ligament suspension, uterosacral ligament suspension, and transvaginal mesh, but the open approach also resulted in longer operating times and greater delay in resumption of activities. The longer time to resumption of activities can be mitigated by the use of laparoscopy or robot-assisted surgery to perform the abdominal procedure.

A retrospective analysis of Medicare data from 2002 to 2011 reported that women age 65 years or older undergoing sacrocolpopexy had higher rates of 30-day readmissions (7.4 versus 3.5 to 4.5 percent), 30-day gastrointestinal complications (6 versus 1 percent), and surgical site infections (5.9 versus 3.1 to 3.7 percent) compared with women undergoing native tissue vaginal repairs (uterosacral ligament and sacrospinous ligament suspension); however, there was no difference in prolapse recurrence at 12 months amongst the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A major limitation of this study is that most sacrocolpopexies were done using an open technique, which is associated with more complications and longer recoveries than laparoscopic and robotic approaches. Its generalizability is also limited to older women. A large retrospective cohort of over 450 women undergoing laparoscopic or robotic sacrocolpopexy reported a gastrointestinal complication rate of only 2.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In contrast with the abdominal approaches that utilize synthetic mesh, an additional benefit of native-tissue vaginal repairs is the avoidance foreign body complications, such as mesh exposure, that can occur with insertion of synthetic graft materials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors#H183640507\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Complications and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Complications by procedure'</a>.)</p><p>Transvaginal surgery is performed in 80 to 90 percent of prolapse surgeries in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/2,3,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,39</a>]. This may be secondary to the minimally invasive nature of vaginal surgery and the ease of addressing the anterior and posterior compartments more easily at the time of vaginal surgery; however, outcome data after ASC suggest that simply addressing the apex often corrects both anterior and posterior defects as well. In addition, vaginal surgery has a shorter operative duration and recovery compared with open abdominal sacral colpopexy. For these reasons, it is often selected by women with increased surgical risk or who place a high priority on avoiding an abdominal incision. Lastly, native tissue vaginal repair eliminates the risk factors for mesh-related complications associated with abdominal support procedures or vaginal mesh procedures. The elimination of mesh-related complications can be particularly important in women at higher risk of mesh or graft erosion (eg, women who smoke or are immunosuppressed).

If the vaginal muscularis is well suspended at the apex, many anterior and posterior defects will also resolve; conversely, correction of anterior or posterior prolapse does not repair apical descent.

In the scenario of superior surgical results with hysterectomy, 21 percent of women indicated they would still decline a hysterectomy and elect uterine preservation instead.

Uterine preservation necessitates ongoing surveillance for cervical and uterine pathology, which may be more technically challenging following prolapse repair.</p><p>While hysterectomy has traditionally been performed with POP repair, there are few data to support that practice. Comparison of study outcomes between hysteropexy and hysterectomy are confounded by anatomic variables (isolated apical prolapse or multiple compartment prolapse), hormonal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal on hormone therapy, and postmenopausal without hormone therapy), and surgical approach (vaginal, open abdominal, laparoscopic, and robotic).

However, two randomized trials have found that robotic compared with conventional laparoscopic sacral colpopexy has a longer operative duration (24 to 67 minutes longer) and higher costs, with similar complication rates and short-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. </p><p>Although further studies are necessary to ascertain the role for robotic versus laparoscopic sacral colpopexy, current data suggest that the laparoscopic route may be more cost effective and confer some benefits to the patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3584652\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open abdominal sacral colpopexy is performed through a lower abdominal incision, typically a Pfannenstiel, although there are increasing numbers of sacral colpopexies being done laparoscopically or with robotic-assisted laparoscopic procedures secondary to decreased recovery times and equivalent prolapse outcomes.</p><p>A commonly performed technique is to attach a permanent mesh to the posterior vagina to the level of the rectal reflection and to the anterior vagina for a distance of 4 cm, or just above the bladder trigone. It is acceptable to use a mesh fashioned into a Y configuration or to use two separate strips of mesh. Alternatively, the posterior mesh may extend to the perineal body, adding support to this area (sacral colpoperineopexy). Two rows of sutures are then used to widely attach the mesh to the vagina to distribute the tension; the sutures should approximate the mesh to the vaginal walls for a distance of several centimeters. Permanent sutures are typically used to attach the mesh to the vagina and sacrum. Secondary to concern about vaginal erosion of permanent sutures, some surgeons are starting to use delayed absorbable sutures. In the Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts (CARE) trial (a randomized trial that compared abdominal sacral colpopexy with and without Burch colposuspension) of 322 women undergoing abdominal sacral colpopexy with permanent sutures, only three participants had a vaginal erosion of the permanent suture in the first two years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The suture was simply removed in all three patients; two healed without further problem, and the other was lost to follow-up. Given the lack of high quality data supporting comparable anatomic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatic outcomes with use of delayed absorbable sutures and the minimal risks associated with permanent suture, patients should be counseled appropriately if nonpermanent sutures are used. </p><p>Failure to attach the mesh anteriorly results in anterior vaginal wall recurrence rates of almost 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The optimal approach for posterior vaginal wall attachment is unclear; however, simply attaching the mesh to the rectovaginal septum to maintain continuity with the perineal body results in high success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The mesh erosion rates reported from abdominovaginal attachment of the mesh to the perineal body have varied widely (7 to 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. </p><p>After exposing the presacral space, the free end of the mesh is attached to the anterior longitudinal ligament just below the sacral promontory using two or three nonbraided permanent sutures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1614175\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoiding presacral hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laceration of the presacral venous plexus leads to profuse hemorrhage.

The best type of mesh and suture material remains controversial, but most surgeons agree that synthetic nonabsorbable materials should be used. Synthetic mesh sacral colpopexy has consistently outperformed the biologic graft materials (autologous, allogeneic, xenograft) in randomized trials, but at the expense of higher mesh erosion rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/54,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,79,80</a>].

No high quality data exist comparing Burch colposuspension to midurethral sling in women with prolapse. Forty-eight percent of women assigned to Burch and 55 percent to sling underwent concomitant prolapse surgery, including anterior repairs, vaginal and abdominal apical suspension procedures, and hysterectomy.

Of these, only the sacrospinous is a true ligament. This is typically performed in women who have undergone total hysterectomy, although cervix and uterine sparing procedures are possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Vaginal procedures require a sufficient vaginal length to reach the supporting ligament. </p><p>Sacrospinous ligament suspension (SSLS) was the most commonly used transvaginal procedure for apical prolapse repair. However, more recently, uterosacral ligament suspension (ULS) has gained popularity. The uterosacral technique was introduced in the 1920s, but in the half-century that followed, reconstructive surgeons seemed to shift focus away from the uterosacral ligaments to more sturdy sites of fixation, such as the SSLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. High rates of recurrent anterior vaginal wall prolapse are common after SSLS, so surgeons attempted to find a more anatomic site to attach the apex to prevent defects in other compartments. Uterosacral and iliococcygeus suspension are two such attempts.</p><p>In general, surgeons in the United States use a ULS when performing concomitant vaginal hysterectomy, while SSLS is used more commonly for post-hysterectomy prolapse repair. However, both procedures may be performed in women with a prior hysterectomy or at the time of concomitant hysterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161568025\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine preservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No high quality evidence is available to guide surgeons regarding uterine preservation at the time of vaginal apical suspension procedures. A small, nonrandomized prospective trial compared women undergoing sacrospinous cervicopexy with uterine preservation and those undergoing SSLS with vaginal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Uterine preservation was associated with less blood loss and shorter operating times. Anatomic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) outcomes and reoperation for POP were similar for both groups. In a meta-analysis of two trials and four studies comparing vaginal sacrospinous hysteropexy with vaginal hysterectomy with apical repair, apical failure and repeat surgery rates were similar for both procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Uterine conservation at the time of prolapse repair is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure#H2327312\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;, section on 'Concomitant hysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8286292\"><span class=\"h2\">Sacrospinous ligament suspension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSLS (also referred to as sacrospinous ligament fixation) is the most commonly studied transvaginal procedure for treating vaginal vault prolapse. </p><p>Although SSLS may also improve anterior vaginal wall prolapse, it is less effective for this indication. Thus, women with large anterior wall defects in addition to apical defects may benefit from another type of prolapse repair, which better supports the anterior vagina or concomitant anterior colporrhaphy.

Most surgeons prefer the right side since the bowel enters the rectum on the left side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Some surgeons have proposed bilateral SSLS, although the value of this modification has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/112-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">112-114</a>]. Use of the bilateral technique depends upon adequate vaginal length and width.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8286299\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before starting the procedure, the patient is examined to ensure that the vagina is long enough to reach the sacrospinous ligament. Women who do not have sufficient vaginal length for SSLS may be candidates for abdominal sacral colpopexy. </p><p>The sacrospinous ligament extends from the ischial spines to the lower portion of the sacrum and coccyx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60078 \">figure 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57811 \">figure 10</a>). The coccygeus muscle follows the same path as the sacrospinous ligament; together they are referred to as the coccygeus muscle-sacrospinous ligament complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82007 \">figure 11</a>). The ligament can be identified on pelvic examination by palpating the ischial spine and tracing posteriorly and medially to the sacrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Marking sutures are placed on the vaginal epithelium at the site where it will attach to the sacrospinous ligament. </p><p>Several techniques are commonly used when performing a SSLS. In one modification, the perirectal space is entered by opening the posterior vagina in the midline from the perineal body to the apex. The vaginal epithelium is then separated from the underlying muscularis. The dissection is continued to the level of the ischial spine. The rectovaginal space is opened by gently pushing the rectum medially then perforating the rectal pillar (areolar tissue that extends from the rectum to the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis and overlies the levator muscle) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51329 \">figure 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>Once the perirectal space is entered, the ischial spine can be palpated and the ligament found medially. A long right angle retractor (eg, Breisky-Navratil) is placed on the ischial spine to protect the pudendal neurovascular bundle and two others are used to retract the bladder superiorly and the rectum medially. </p><p>With the ligament clearly visible, two to three sutures are placed through the ligament approximately one and one-half finger-breadths medial to the ischial spine. Several techniques and devices are available to assist placing the suture through the ligament (eg, Miya hook, Deschamps ligature carrier, laparoscopic suturing devices) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p>After securing the sutures to the ligament complex, each of the sutures is placed through the muscularis on the undersurface of the posterior vaginal epithelium and tied by a pulley stitch, while the free end of the suture is held. Traction on the free end of the suture draws the vaginal apex directly onto the sacrospinous ligament and the suture is tied.</p><p>Another common modification of the SSLS is the &quot;Michigan Modification&quot; technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/117,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,118</a>]. In the Michigan Modification, all four vaginal walls are directly approximated to the sacrospinous ligament (instead of just the posterior vaginal wall). The point on each vaginal wall that reaches the ligament is identified and the intervening diamond of vaginal epithelium is excised. The sutures are placed through the sacrospinous ligament, as described above, then sewn through to both the anterior and posterior vagina and tied to the ligament. A long-lasting absorbable suture is used. The goal of this modification is to decrease the risk of an anterior vaginal wall recurrence; although it has not been evaluated in comparative studies with standard SSLS, case series report high long-term satisfaction rates after the procedure. A single site study reported that 76 percent of women were &ldquo;completely or very&rdquo; satisfied at least five years after SSLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8286306\"><span class=\"h4\">Avoiding nerve entrapment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several techniques to decrease the risk of entrapment of the sciatic nerve or its branches when the sutures are placed. One approach is to perforate the sacrospinous ligament with the needle in a vertical rather than horizontal orientation, thereby attempting to place the suture parallel to the course of these nerves. Also, since these nerves did not travel in the lateral third segment of the sacrospinous ligament, placement of the fixation sutures within this region is another approach to decrease the risk of nerve injury. Regional anesthesia of prolonged duration should not be used postoperatively in women undergoing SSLS, since this may mask the symptoms of nerve entrapment. (See <a href=\"#H8286320\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2590805457\"><span class=\"h4\">Treating hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant hemorrhage has been reported in 0.2 to 2 percent of SSLS procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. Controlling hemorrhage is challenging because of the small space, lack of visualization, and close approximation of vessels and nerves. Techniques to control bleeding include pressure, topical hemostatic agents, direct repair, vaginal packing, and embolization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based on cadaveric study, vessels at risk for injury include the superior gluteal, inferior gluteal, internal pudendal, vertebral, middle sacral, lateral sacral, and circumflex femoral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Among these vessels, the inferior gluteal artery and its coccygeal branch appear to be the arteries at greatest risk for injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122</a>]. Bleeding encountered during SSLS can typically be managed conservatively with surgical clips, pressure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemostatic agents. A laparoscopic clip applier can facilitate visualization in this deep space when a discrete vessel is identified. Alternatively, use of hemostatic agents and packing for 5 to 10 minutes will control most bleeding. Computed tomography angiography and vessel embolization can be performed when bleeding cannot be controlled with more conservative measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/120,123-125\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,123-125</a>].

If the sciatic nerve is entrapped in the suture, the classic triad of nerves entrapment will present (paresthesias, pain, temporary relief with injection of local anesthetic). The patient typically awakens with severe buttock pain radiating down the posterior leg. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent neuropathy; therefore, as noted above, regional anesthesia of prolonged duration should not be used for this type of surgery. Upon diagnosis of nerve entrapment, the patient should be taken back to the operating room immediately to have the sutures removed. </p><p>The effect of SSLS on sexual function has not been well studied. Many studies have not evaluated this outcome and some women who undergo apical prolapse repair are not sexually active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].

The rates of a successful outcome for each compartment were: apical (98 percent), anterior (81 percent), and posterior (87 percent). Meta-analysis of subjective outcomes was not possible due to methodologic differences across studies; relief of prolapse symptoms was reported by 82 to 100 percent of patients (this outcome was only reported by five studies).

Cystoscopy should be done routinely at the completion of each case to prevent delayed recognition of ureteral injury. Ureteral kinking from the uterosacral suture is found during routine intraoperative cystoscopy in up to 11 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/143,144\" class=\"abstract_t\">143,144</a>]. If both ureters do not efflux briskly, the most lateral suture (closest to the ureter) on that side should be removed. Typically, removing this suture is sufficient to restore brisk ureteral efflux without further sequelae, although ureteral injury requiring ureteroneocystostomy has been reported.

Proposed advantages of the iliococcygeus suspension compared with SSLS are lower risks of anterior vaginal wall recurrence and injury to the pudendal neurovascular bundle, but these benefits remain unproven. There are few data regarding this procedure. In a case-control study of 128 women, one- to two-year follow-up, subjective success rates were similar for iliococcygeus suspension and SSLS (91 versus 94 percent), but objective success occurred significantly more frequently in women who underwent SSLS (53 versus 67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. Perioperative complications were similar for the two procedures. Some data suggest that vaginal length may be longer following iliococcygeus suspension compared with SSLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22180329\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal mesh kits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One systematic review of articles reporting outcomes of vaginal mesh procedures for apical prolapse concluded that vaginal mesh seemed to effectively cure apical POP; however, long-term anatomic and functional data were needed, as well as comparative studies to traditional POP repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. High complication rates were found with apical mesh procedures (up to 17.6 percent) with mesh erosion and dyspareunia most common. In contrast, authors of another systematic review of vaginal mesh procedures for POP concluded that there were insufficient data to determine efficacy of vaginal mesh procedures for apical POP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This systematic review also found high complication rates associated with vaginal mesh placement, including graft erosion in up to 30 percent, urinary tract infections in up to 19 percent, and visceral injury in up to 3 percent. A randomized trial compared a total vaginal mesh procedure (Prolift; this device has now been removed from the market) with laparoscopic sacral colpopexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. At two-year follow-up, women in the sacral colpopexy group had a significantly higher objective success rate (77 versus 43 percent) and a lower reoperation rate (5 versus 22 percent). This study was limited by methodologic issues. Safety issues regarding transvaginal placement of mesh or biografts are discussed in detail separately.

ULS potentially improves anterior vaginal wall support compared to SSLS. On the other hand, the risk of ureteral injury and need for cystoscopy for ULS are disadvantages for this procedure compared with SSLS. </p><p>Randomized trial data suggest that the efficacy of ULS and SSLS are comparable for treating apical prolapse; however, the risks and benefits of the procedures differ slightly. The Operations and Pelvic Muscle Training in the Management of Apical Support Loss (OPTIMAL) randomized trial compared ULS with SSLS in 374 women with POPQ stage 2 to 4 apical vaginal prolapse; all participants also had stress urinary incontinence and underwent a concomitant retropubic midurethral sling procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. The primary surgical outcome was a composite measure of surgical success, defined as the absence of all of the following: (1) vaginal apical descent to more than one-third of the vaginal length; (2) anterior or posterior vaginal wall descent beyond the hymen; (3) bothersome vaginal bulge symptoms; and (4) re-treatment of prolapse by either surgery or pessary. Two years after surgery, 59.2 percent of ULS and 60.5 percent SSLS met this definition of success (odds ratio [OR] 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.5). However, these numbers declined to 44 and 33 percent, respectively, by five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. Success rates for anatomic outcomes were 57 and 42, respectively, although symptomatic outcomes were slightly better: 64 and 62 percent, respectively. There were no significant differences between ULS and SSLS in most perioperative outcomes, including blood loss and severe intraoperative or postoperative adverse events. However, women who underwent ULS had a significantly lower rate of neurologic pain requiring intervention (6.9 versus 12.4 percent; OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-1.0). Pain also persisted to the four- to six-week postoperative visit in fewer women following ULS (0.5 versus 4.3 percent). Ureteral obstruction occurred in six women in the ULS group (3.2 percent) and none in the SSLS group; however, most cases were detected and treated intraoperatively. At two-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the ULS and SSLS groups (surgical success 59.2 versus 60.5 percent; OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.5). In a planned secondary analysis of the OPTIMAL trial, there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences between the SSLS and ULS groups for the outcomes of quality of life, sexual function, de novo dyspareunia, and body image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. &#160;</p><p>It is important to note that the OPTIMAL trial also compared perioperative behavioral therapy with pelvic floor muscle training with usual care. In a subgroup analysis of the usual care group, at two-year follow-up, ULS had a significantly lower rate of apical descent than SSLS (8.6 versus 20.8 percent; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9). Among women who received usual care, bothersome vaginal bulge symptoms were also lower in the ULS group (15.4 versus 21.1 percent), although the statistical significance was not reported. Rates of re-treatment were not reported for this subgroup analysis. This raises the question of whether ULS is the superior procedure for most women, since most women receive usual care. The pelvic floor muscle training aspect of the trial is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H804069\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic floor muscle training'</a> below.)</p><p>A meta-analysis of observational studies suggests ULS results in excellent apical outcomes; however, anterior success (stage 0 or I) rates were only 67 percent in women with preoperative stage III prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. </p><p>Given the available data, outcomes appear similar for ULS and SSLS. However, risks and benefits differ slightly, so patients should be counseled regarding a slightly higher risk of persistent neurologic pain that may require reintervention after SSLS compared with the increased risk for ureteral obstruction with ULS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative care is similar for both vaginal and abdominal approaches; however, recovery after abdominal sacral colpopexy may be slower than transvaginal procedures due to the abdominal incision.

We advise no sexual intercourse for six weeks to avoid disruption of the repair. </p><p>We see patients at two weeks postoperatively for routine follow-up.

Many clinicians also advise patients to perform these exercises following pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. However, there is not high quality evidence to support the efficacy of perioperative use. This was investigated in the Operations and Pelvic Muscle Training in the Management of Apical Support Loss (OPTIMAL) randomized trial (n = 374) that compared sacrospinous ligament suspension (SSLS) with uterosacral ligament suspension (ULS), as well as perioperative behavioral therapy with pelvic floor muscle training (BPMT) with usual care; behavioral therapy included education on behavioral strategies to reduce urinary and colorectal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].
