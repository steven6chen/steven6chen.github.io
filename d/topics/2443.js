Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a more descriptive term for this process in ESRD patients; however, calciphylaxis is still widely used to describe this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. We use the term CUA to refer to calciphylaxis in ESRD patients. We continue to use the term calciphylaxis to refer to the disorder in non-ESRD patients.</p><p>This topic reviews the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of CUA.</p><p>Other issues related to vascular calcification in ESRD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CUA is a poorly understood disorder. It is believed to be part of a continuum of the systemic vascular and soft-tissue calcification that is common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, whereas many ESRD patients have vascular calcification, few develop clinical manifestations of CUA, suggesting contribution of other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of CUA result from reductions in the arteriolar blood flow. Reduced blood flow is caused by calcification, fibrosis, and thrombus formation primarily involving the dermo-hypodermic arterioles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Medial vessel calcification occurs first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Ongoing vascular endothelial injury causes cutaneous arteriolar narrowing and a hypercoagulable state that causes tissue infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Factors presumed to be involved in the widespread calcification are chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) and its treatment (including hyperparathyroidism, abnormalities in calcium and phosphate, and vitamin D administration), deficiencies in inhibitors of vascular calcifications, and chronic inflammation. These are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2270362066\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperparathyroidism, active vitamin D administration, hyperphosphatemia, and an elevated plasma calcium x phosphate product (Ca x P) have historically been implicated in CUA. A role for hyperparathyroidism was suggested by animal models that show that the administration of large amounts of parathyroid hormone (PTH) induces ischemic skin necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, parathyroidectomy has been associated with clinical improvement in patients. In a retrospective review, 38 of 58 CUA patients who underwent parathyroidectomy survived compared with 13 of 37 patients who did not undergo parathyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The benefit of parathyroidectomy may be related to the transient uptake of calcium and phosphate into bone that occurs following surgery (ie, &quot;hungry bone syndrome&quot;) and a lower Ca x P product.</p><p>However, there has been no systematic or prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of parathyroidectomy to treat CUA. Moreover, most patients with severe hyperparathyroidism do not have skin necrosis, and many patients with CUA do not have hyperparathyroidism, indicating other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Studies that report comprehensive data on PTH levels months to years prior to CUA diagnosis are required to determine the pathogenic role of hyperparathyroidism in CUA.</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> to treat hyperparathyroidism may reduce the risk of CUA. This was suggested by an analysis of adverse event reports collected during the Evaluation of Cinacalcet (EVOLVE) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Among 3861 participants who received at least one dose of the study drug, 24 developed CUA during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The risk of CUA was lower among those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> compared with placebo (6 versus 18, unadjusted relative hazard ratio [HR] 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.79).</p><p>However, our confidence in the results of this trial is limited. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> reduced the risk of hyperparathyroidism, the mechanism appears to have been unrelated to its effect on PTH. In addition, there was a high dropout rate in the cinacalcet group and a high rate of crossover in the placebo group. Further study is needed to determine whether cinacalcet prevents calciphylaxis in high-risk individuals.</p><p>The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> in treatment of CUA is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3355896936\" class=\"local\">'Treat abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, and hyperparathyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p>At high doses, vitamin D administration can induce CUA and exacerbate soft-tissue calcifications in experimental models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This observation may be relevant since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> and other vitamin D analogs are routinely administered to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in ESRD patients. Active vitamin D analogs may contribute to CUA either indirectly, through their actions to increase serum phosphate, or directly, through their effect on the vasculature. Whether excessive doses of active vitamin D analogs are associated with an increased incidence of CUA and whether there are differences in CUA risk between individual active vitamin D compounds are unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhibitors of vascular calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deficiencies in inhibitors of vascular calcifications may play a role in CUA pathogenesis. Such inhibitors include fetuin-A (2-Heremens-Schmid glycoprotein) and matrix Gla protein (MGP) in CUA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetuin-A (eg, 2-Heremens-Schmid glycoprotein) is an abundant serum glycoprotein that binds calcium and phosphate in the circulation, thereby forming &quot;calciprotein particles&quot; that help clear the circulation of excess Ca x PO<sub>4</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In animal models, fetuin-A limits organ and soft-tissue calcification and vascular calcium deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Vitamin D-mediated tissue calciphylaxis is associated with fetuin-A downregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical observations also support a role for fetuin-A. Low fetuin-A levels correlate with a chronic inflammatory state and cardiovascular calcification in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Compared with healthy individuals, serum fetuin-A levels from hemodialysis patients are lower and have diminished capacity to inhibit ex-vivo Ca x PO<sub>4</sub> precipitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fetuin-A is downregulated in inflammatory states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and has been reported to be decreased in CUA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MGP is a mineral-binding extracellular matrix protein that is synthesized by vascular smooth muscle, endothelium, and chondrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. MGP inhibits calcification of arteries and cartilage in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. MGP activity depends upon vitamin K-dependent carboxylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This is relevant because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> use is a risk factor for CUA, and warfarin is known to inhibit vitamin K-dependent mechanisms. The warfarin-induced inhibition of vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of MGP may be a mechanism by which warfarin increases the risk of CUA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/11,15,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15,25-27</a>].

Studies on the molecular regulators and inhibitors of skeletal and extraskeletal mineralization are needed to further our knowledge on the pathogenesis of CUA.

The reasons for this apparent increase are unknown and may just represent improved awareness of CUA and better recognition of clinical signs and associated risk factors.

Of the 2234 dialysis patients, 142 were on warfarin. All cases of CUA occurred in the warfarin group (4 of 142 patients). In a matched case-control study of hospitalized patients, 62 dialysis patients with biopsy-proven CUA were compared with 124 control dialysis patients without CUA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Warfarin use was associated with CUA (odds ratio [OR] 4.3, 95% CI 1.14-4.43). In the German CUA registry, 52 percent of CUA patients received warfarin prior to CUA diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Iron administration has been proposed as a risk factor for calciphylaxis.

However, a skin biopsy is frequently not performed among patients who have active infection (ie, bacteremia or sepsis), since a biopsy may invite further infection. Many clinicians reserve skin biopsy for ambiguous cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

However, despite these risks, we believe that it is critical to establish a clear diagnosis of CUA in most patients so that specific treatment may be initiated.

The incidence may be increasing due in part to the awareness and the recognition of associated clinical signs. The prognosis is poor. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations include livedo reticularis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> violaceous, painful, plaque&ndash;like subcutaneous nodules.

Lesions classically develop in areas with greatest adiposity, including the abdomen, buttock, and thigh. There are no specific diagnostic laboratory tests for calciphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is suggested by the characteristic ischemic skin lesions and their distribution.
