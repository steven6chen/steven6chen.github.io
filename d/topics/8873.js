These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with ovulation &ndash; Ovulation is the time in a woman's monthly cycle when the ovary releases an egg into the fallopian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). Hormones control ovulation. Pregnancy can occur if sperm fertilizes the egg as it travels to the uterus after ovulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73238\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73238 \">figure 2</a>). Women have the highest chance of getting pregnant if they have sex 1 to 2 days before ovulation or on the day of ovulation. In some women, ovulation does not happen on a regular basis or at all.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the uterus or fallopian tubes &ndash; For example, some women have scar tissue in their fallopian tubes from past infections or surgery. This scar tissue can cause the fallopian tubes to be blocked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometriosis &ndash; Endometriosis is a condition that can cause pain in the lower part of the belly. This can also lead to trouble getting pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age &ndash; Once women get into their mid- to late-30s, it can be harder to get pregnant, so it can take longer. Getting pregnant can be even more of a problem for women in their 40s.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458566959\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I see a doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor if you do not get pregnant after having unprotected sex for 1 year. But if you get worried before then, see your doctor sooner. And if you are older than 35 or not getting your period every month, see your doctor if you can't get pregnant after 6 months of trying.</p><p>Your doctor will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will often do tests to try to figure out the cause of the problem. Plus, your partner might need to be tested, too. But don't be surprised if your doctor cannot tell you what is wrong. It's not always possible to find out why a woman cannot get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458566966\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are overweight, losing weight might help you become pregnant. Losing weight can also help you have a healthier pregnancy when you become pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458566973\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments are available?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have trouble getting pregnant might choose to have one or more of the following treatments. You and your doctor should discuss which treatment to try first. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">clomiphene</a> (brand names: Clomid, Serophene) &ndash; This medicine improves the chances that ovulation will occur. Many times, doctors prescribe this treatment first. Your doctor will tell you how and when to take this medicine. He or she will also tell you when to have sex so the treatment has the best chance of working. If this medicine does not work after a few months, your doctor might recommend trying other medicines to help with ovulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone shots &ndash; Hormone shots are often recommended if a woman does not get pregnant with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">clomiphene</a>. Hormones improve the chances that ovulation will occur. Your doctor will tell you how and when to do this treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine insemination &ndash; For this treatment, a doctor uses a tube to place sperm directly inside a woman's uterus. This is done right before ovulation. For some women, this treatment is combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">clomiphene</a> or hormone shots to increase the chance of pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vitro fertilization, also called &quot;IVF&quot; &ndash; IVF is a procedure that is usually done if other treatments have not worked. It involves the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A woman gives herself hormone shots for a few weeks. These hormones get the ovary ready to ovulate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Just before ovulation, the doctor uses a thin needle to remove some eggs from the ovaries. He or she does this through the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The eggs are put into a test tube with sperm so that the sperm can fertilize one or more eggs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After 2 to 5 days, the fertilized egg or eggs are put in the woman's uterus. Hopefully, one of the eggs will attach to the uterus and grow into a pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IVF is usually done in women:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Whose fallopian tubes are missing or blocked</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>With male partners who have too few sperm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Who have not been able to get pregnant using other treatments</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458566980\"><span class=\"h1\">How will I know if a treatment is working?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will do tests at different times during treatment to check if it is working. These tests can include blood tests and ultrasound. Ultrasound is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458566987\"><span class=\"h1\">Do treatments always work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Treatments do not always help a woman get pregnant. The same treatment can work for one woman, but not another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458566994\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide which treatment to have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talk with your doctor about the benefits and downsides of the different treatments. To choose the treatment that is right for you, you might want to think about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well your doctor thinks the treatment will work</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cost of the treatment &ndash; Some treatments cost a lot of money. Health insurance does not pay for all types of treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long the treatment will take &ndash; Treatments might need to be done more than once to work. Getting pregnant can take months to years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects and downsides of the treatment</p><p/><p>You should also talk with your doctor about other options for having children, such as adoption.</p><p>A woman can have a tough time making these decisions. You might find it helpful to talk to a counselor or go to a support group for people who are having trouble getting pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458567001\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-couples-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in couples (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in men (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ovulation induction with clomiphene (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-treatment-with-gonadotropins-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Infertility treatment with gonadotropins (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization-ivf-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: In vitro fertilization (IVF) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infertile-couple-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Evaluation of the infertile couple (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-male-infertility-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Treatment of male infertility (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Endometriosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
