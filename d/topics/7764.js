Other more serious and aggressive periodontal diseases also are seen occasionally in children, and some of these diseases are signs of systemic diseases or conditions. Definitive diagnosis usually requires a detailed dental examination, including intraoral radiographs and periodontal probing, but signs can be recognized from visual inspection of the gingival and other oral structures.</p><p>Periodontal diseases affect the dental supporting structures, primarily the gingiva and alveolar bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67237 \">figure 1</a>). They are caused by complex communities of bacteria that grow in a biofilm on the surface of the tooth (dental plaque). Bacteria elicit an inflammatory response that can result in tissue destruction. Both gingivitis and periodontitis occur in children and adolescents. Gingivitis is a reversible dental plaque-induced inflammation limited to the gingiva, and it is common in children as young as five years of age. Periodontitis is usually accompanied by gingivitis but involves irreversible destruction of the supporting tissues surrounding the tooth, including the alveolar bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67237 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Some degree of periodontitis is seen in most adults, in whom chronic periodontitis is the major cause of tooth loss. Although chronic periodontitis often begins in adolescence, progression is slow, and cumulative signs of destruction are usually not noted before young adulthood. The more aggressive and rarer forms of periodontitis do produce destruction that is apparent during childhood. The prevalence of these diseases is probably less than 2 percent of the population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gingivitis and periodontitis in adults: Classification and dental treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Aggressive periodontitis'</a> below.)</p><p>The periodontal examination and the presentation and management of gingivitis and periodontitis in children and adolescents are reviewed here. Other soft tissue lesions, the periodontal manifestations of systemic conditions, and gingivitis and periodontitis in adults are discussed separately.

Detailed examination by a dentist is recommended every six months, but several of the signs of periodontal disease are apparent on visual inspection. Heavy plaque (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66029\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66029 \">picture 1</a>) or calculus deposits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50438\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50438 \">picture 2</a>); enlargement or edema of the gingival tissues; redness, bleeding, or recession of the gingiva; abnormal change in tooth position; and premature tooth mobility or tooth loss are indications for referral for further evaluation. In addition, smoking status (both tobacco and marijuana) should be determined because smoking is a major risk factor for the development of periodontal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Patients who smoke should be provided with information about the benefits and methods of quitting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H2589684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Benefits of smoking cessation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-smoking-cessation-in-adolescents#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of smoking cessation in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Interventions'</a>.)</p><p>Calculus, common in adults, is present in approximately 10 percent of children and one-third of adolescents. The typical locations for calculus are the lingual surface of the mandibular incisors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50438\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50438 \">picture 2</a>) and the buccal surface of the maxillary molars. It can be removed only by professional tooth cleaning and should not be allowed to remain on the teeth because it provides a habitat for the bacteria associated with periodontitis. Semiannual tooth cleaning is adequate for most children, but a small number of heavy-calculus formers may require more frequent visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gingival tissues surrounding the teeth in children should appear pink to reddish pink and be firm and resilient. A slight rolling or rounding around the neck of the tooth is normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52338\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52338 \">picture 3</a>). The root surface of the tooth should be covered by gingiva (with underlying bone), but very little of the crown should be covered. The tooth surface along the gingival margin (gum line) should be free of visible plaque deposits or calculus. The marginal gingiva should be smooth, and no bleeding should be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GINGIVITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple gingivitis, characterized by inflammation of the gingival tissues with no loss of attachment or bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70283\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70283 \">picture 4</a>), is the most common periodontal problem in childhood. Inadequate oral hygiene is the most common cause of gingivitis. Certain local factors, by interfering with oral hygiene, physiology, or homeostasis, can predispose to development of gingivitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthodontic appliances, crowding of teeth, and lingually or labially erupted teeth render achieving adequate oral hygiene difficult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66029\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66029 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic mouth breathing can cause localized gingivitis of the exposed gingiva in the maxillary labial area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61062\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61062 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eruption of primary and permanent teeth causes local inflammation and erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70283\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70283 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal changes during puberty and pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82278\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82278 \">picture 6</a>) can cause the gingiva to become inflamed and hypertrophic. Puberty gingivitis is thought to be related to increases in steroid hormones and changes in the subgingival microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Puberty gingivitis may be severe and may be associated with granulomatous changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64885\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64885 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malnutrition, viral infections, stress, and sleep deprivation can predispose to the development of a very severe and painful form of gingivitis, termed acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Longstanding gingivitis can result in chronic inflammatory gingival enlargement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81784\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81784 \">picture 8</a>), which is a particularly common occurrence in patients with orthodontic appliances and poor oral hygiene. The gingival enlargement usually will resolve slowly after effective, regular oral hygiene measures are instituted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-lesions-of-the-oral-cavity-in-children#H2297018720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue lesions of the oral cavity in children&quot;, section on 'Gingival overgrowth'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gingivitis is uncommon in young children with early primary dentition. It is present in up to one-half of the population by the age of four to five years. The prevalence of gingivitis increases with age, peaking at close to 100 percent at puberty (approximately 10 years of age in girls and 13 years of age in boys). After puberty, the prevalence declines to 50 percent and remains relatively constant into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inflammation responsible for gingivitis occurs in response to the bacteria that live in biofilms at the gingival margin and in the gingival crevice. These biofilm communities are complex. Levels of many species of bacteria are elevated in gingivitis. Gingivitis resolves when plaque is removed consistently.</p><p>Young children have less plaque and appear to be less reactive to plaque than are adults; thus gingivitis is an uncommon occurrence in children with early primary dentition. The diminished reaction may be a result of differences in bacterial colonization and developmental changes in the inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of gingivitis are those of inflammation, predominantly edema and erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70283\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70283 \">picture 4</a>). In severe cases, the gingival tissues may bleed spontaneously from ulcerations in the sulcus. Tissue hypertrophy also may develop if the inflammation is longstanding. Gingivitis can be described as localized or generalized, marginal or diffuse, desquamative, hemorrhagic, and even sometimes suppurative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Childhood gingivitis is reversible; it is treated through improved oral hygiene. Recommendations for improving oral hygiene are based on observational studies and small clinical trials. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of an appropriately sized toothbrush (smaller heads and larger handles are helpful for children; brushes labeled for specific age groups are available from several manufacturers)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of toothpaste and dental floss in flavors that appeal to children</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parental supervision and assistance in the oral hygiene routine of children younger than 8 to 10 years of age</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE NECROTIZING ULCERATIVE GINGIVITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) is a painful gingivitis with rapid onset, interproximal and marginal soft tissue necrosis, ulceration, and bleeding. It is associated with high oral concentrations of spirochetes and <em>Prevotella intermedia</em>. In developed countries, including North America and Europe, ANUG is rare and the incidence peaks in the late teens and early twenties; however, in less developed countries, ANUG commonly occurs in young children. Factors that predispose to development of ANUG include malnutrition, smoking, viral infections, stress, and sleep deprivation. Standard treatment involves local debridement, which usually produces rapid resolution. A number of chemical agents have been tested in small trials, and none appear to surpass simple debridement. Antibiotic therapy with penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metronidazole</a> may be indicated in patients with fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIODONTITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodontitis is characterized by gingival inflammation with accompanying (and irreversible) loss of supportive connective tissues, including alveolar bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67237 \">figure 1</a>). It results in apical migration of the attachment of the epithelium to the tooth surface and the development of a &quot;periodontal pocket.&quot;</p><p>Several distinct forms of periodontitis are recognized, with chronic periodontitis being the most common. Chronic periodontitis usually is not diagnosed until adulthood, although it may have its onset in childhood. Other more aggressive forms of periodontitis, although more rare, are diagnosed most frequently initially in the pediatric population. They include localized aggressive periodontitis and periodontitis associated with systemic conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodontal disease in children: Associated systemic conditions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic periodontitis and most other forms of periodontitis are caused by bacteria residing in biofilms in the gingival sulcus, and therapy is aimed at eradicating or reducing the numbers of these bacteria. Approximately 700 species of bacteria commonly reside in the sulcus, some of them not yet cultivable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Several species that have been associated consistently with chronic periodontitis include <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis</em>, <em>Bacteroides forsythus</em>, and <em>Treponema denticola</em>. These bacteria have been detected regularly in asymptomatic children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], but they do not appear to establish stable colonization, and researchers assume they do not occur in high numbers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of periodontal attachment is common in adults, with most adults being affected by chronic periodontitis. However, with increased focus on early detection and prevention of dental disease, incipient periodontitis is being identified in greater numbers of children. When careful measurements were taken, 20 percent of 14- to 17-year-old adolescents in the United States were found to have attachment loss of at least 2 mm at one or more sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], indicating chronic periodontitis often begins in adolescence.</p><p>The number and severity of affected sites increases steadily with age as the damage accumulates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but the rate of progression of disease in chronic periodontitis is similar regardless of age. Smoking is a major risk factor for developing chronic periodontitis. Other, more aggressive forms of periodontitis are more unusual, but they are seen most commonly in the pediatric population. Localized aggressive periodontitis (previously called localized juvenile periodontitis) and localized prepubertal periodontitis are described below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Localized aggressive'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, childhood periodontitis is associated with several systemic conditions, including Down syndrome, neutropenia, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, diabetes mellitus, and Papillon-Lef&egrave;vre syndrome. In addition, the signs of other systemic diseases may mimic those of periodontitis, including leukemia, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and hypophosphatasia. Although many patients with periodontitis are healthy except for subtle abnormalities in host defenses, children with periodontal disease should be evaluated for the above-mentioned conditions, some of which may be serious or even life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodontal disease in children: Associated systemic conditions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of advanced periodontitis include attachment loss, gingival recession, periodontal bone loss, tooth mobility, and tooth loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67237 \">figure 1</a>). In the early stages of disease, gingival recession may not be present. Periodontal bone loss can be localized, generalized, horizontal, or vertical. Periodontal disease may be episodic; the periods between disease activity and inactivity are unpredictable.</p><p>In most cases, early periodontitis in children is not clinically obvious without probing for attachment loss and obtaining radiographs to assess the bone levels around the teeth. Premature tooth mobility or tooth loss is a late sign and may indicate advanced periodontal disease, which may be the presenting sign of a serious systemic condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58443 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Chronic periodontitis in the early stages responds well to appropriate periodontal therapy, which must include improved oral hygiene. If detected and treated early, it can be arrested in the early stages, when attachment loss is minimal and deep pockets have not developed. The more aggressive forms of periodontitis usually require antibiotic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Aggressive periodontitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive periodontitis usually affects individuals younger than 35 years of age and is characterized by a rapid rate of bone loss and progression of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Affected individuals are otherwise clinically healthy. This type of periodontitis occurs uncommonly and in association with defects in host immunity and specific etiologic microbial flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Familial aggregation often is seen.</p><p>Because it occurs infrequently, the understanding of aggressive periodontitis is incomplete. Further research is needed to better characterize the diagnosis and management of this type of periodontal disease. Aggressive periodontitis occurs in a localized and generalized form. The generalized form usually affects young adults, usually is not seen in childhood, and will not be discussed further here. The localized form affects primarily children and is described in detail below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gingivitis and periodontitis in adults: Classification and dental treatment&quot;, section on 'Aggressive periodontitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Localized aggressive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) is characterized by loss of attachment and bone around the permanent incisors and permanent molars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The attachment loss occurs rapidly, at three times the rate of loss in adult-onset disease. The radiographic appearance is distinctive.</p><p>The prevalence of LAgP is estimated to be approximately 1 percent, and in the United States it is most commonly seen in the African American population. At least some cases appear to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. LAgP has been linked to a neutrophil chemotactic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. In addition to the genetic component, LAgP clearly is linked to the presence of high numbers of <em>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</em>, and successful treatment outcomes correlate well with eradication of the bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].</p><p>LAgP usually is detected in early adolescence. However, retrospective examination of earlier radiographs sometimes reveals undetected disease in the primary dentition, suggesting that LAgP and localized prepubertal periodontitis are the same entity. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Localized prepubertal'</a> below.)</p><p>Inflammation and accumulation of plaque in children with LAgP occur to a greater extent than they do in the average teenager. In contrast, the inflammation in LAgP is usually not as extreme as that seen in the forms of periodontitis associated with systemic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodontal disease in children: Associated systemic conditions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of LAgP consists of local debridement combined with systemic antibiotic therapy and clinical monitoring. Effective oral antibiotic regimens include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metronidazole</a> alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracycline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,30,31</a>]. Azithromycin often is preferred because of its simple regimen (once a day for three days) and relative safety. Although metronidazole or combination metronidazole and amoxicillin appears to be more effective than tetracycline, there are concerns that metronidazole may be carcinogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Reattachment and resolution of the periodontal defects may occur after antibiotic therapy.

An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been described in one extended family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>LPP is characterized by bilateral, symmetric, localized loss of attachment in the primary dentition, typically involving the molar area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. LPP typically is accompanied by greater-than-average plaque deposits, calculus, and mild to moderate inflammation.</p><p>LPP usually is diagnosed in the late primary or early transitional dentition. It may progress to LAgP in the permanent dentition. LPP and LAgP probably are the same disease, differing only in age of onset or detection. The distinctive tooth patterns probably are determined by sequence of tooth eruption and time of onset of disease. LPP has not been as extensively studied as LAgP. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Localized aggressive'</a> above.)</p><p>Treatment involves local debridement and antibiotic therapy.

The predominant clinical manifestations are edema and erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70283\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70283 \">picture 4</a>). In severe cases, the gingival tissues may bleed spontaneously. Childhood gingivitis is treated through improved oral hygiene. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Gingivitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis is a painful gingivitis with rapid onset, interproximal and marginal soft tissue necrosis, ulceration, and bleeding. Predisposing factors include malnutrition, smoking, viral infections, stress, and sleep deprivation. Treatment involves local debridement, which usually produces rapid resolution. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodontitis is characterized by gingival inflammation with accompanying (and irreversible) loss of supportive connective tissues, including alveolar bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67237 \">figure 1</a>). It results in apical migration of the attachment of the epithelium to the tooth surface and the development of a &quot;periodontal pocket.&quot; Chronic periodontitis may have its incipient onset in young patients, although it does not advance to significant disease until adulthood. Early stage disease is treated by professional debridement and improved home oral hygiene. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Periodontitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized aggressive periodontitis, although rare, occurs in adolescents and prepubertal children and involves rapid destruction of the periodontal tissues. Periodontitis is precipitated by bacteria residing in biofilms in the gingival sulcus. Therapy consists of local debridement and systemic antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Aggressive periodontitis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Position paper: epidemiology of periodontal diseases.
