The fusion between the septum primum and the endocardial cushions closes the orifice (ostium primum) separating the right and left atria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A second orifice (the ostium secundum) develops in the septum primum; this orifice is covered by the septum secundum that arises on the right atrial side of the septum primum. The septum secundum grows caudally and covers the ostium secundum forming the fossa ovalis. However, the septum secundum does not completely divide the atria in the fetus; it leaves an oval orifice (the foramen ovale) that is covered (but not sealed) on the left side by the flexible flap of the septum primum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In the fetus, the foramen ovale is held open by the pressure gradient between the right and left atria. Right atrial pressure is higher than that on the left and pushes the flexible septum primum aside, permitting right to left flow of oxygenated blood from the inferior vena cava into the left ventricle. At birth, expansion of the lungs lowers right heart pressures at the same time that systemic vascular resistance rises, causing reversal of the atrial gradient. The septum primum is then held against the septum secundum and the interatrial shunt ceases. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal physiology'</a> below.)</p><p>In approximately 70 percent of individuals, the septum primum and septum secundum fuse after birth, creating an intact interatrial septum; the remnant of the foramen ovale in the right atrium is termed the fossa ovalis. However, in a significant proportion of the population, the septae do <strong>not</strong> fuse. If the foramen ovale is completely covered, but not sealed, it is called a &quot;probe patent&quot; or simply &quot;patent&quot; foramen ovale (PFO), indicating that the foramen can be opened (by a reversal of the interatrial pressure gradient or by an intracardiac catheter). Less commonly, an open communication persists between the atria after septation. Such a communication is called an atrial septal defect (ASD).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039316642\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial septal defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embryonic abnormalities in septal formation result in the following two most common types of ASDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primum ASD results from arrested or abnormal development of the endocardial cushions, which contribute the apical portion of the atrial septum. It is associated with an anterior mitral valve cleft, which is often accompanied by mitral regurgitation. This form of ASD is also typically associated with atrioventricular (AV) canal defects, which in addition to the primum ASD at the base of the interatrial septum, include AV valve malformations and ventricular septal defects.

However, the true incidence of secundum atrial septal defect may be substantially higher because many ASDs are commonly undiagnosed in infancy and childhood, and spontaneously resolve. (See <a href=\"#H18283612\" class=\"local\">'Spontaneous closure'</a> below.)</p><p>Secundum ASDs are typically located within the fossa ovalis (remnant of the foramen ovale in the right atrium).

Multiple defects can be seen if the floor of the fossa ovalis is fenestrated. The defects vary greatly in size, from less than 3 mm to greater than 20 mm.</p><p>Secundum ASDs may be associated with or continuous with other ASDs, such as a sinus venosus defect or a primum defect.

Defects typically range from 1 to 10 mm in maximal potential diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A PFO is not considered an ASD because no septal tissue is missing. Interatrial shunting cannot occur as long as left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure and the flap valve remnant of septum primum of the foramen ovale is competent. However, persistent left-to-right shunting frequently occurs in the first few weeks of life. The presence of a mild degree of shunting during the neonatal period, particularly in premature infants, is so common that it is usually considered a normal variant finding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) depends upon the relationship of pulmonary and systemic resistances, the compliance of the right and left ventricles, and the size of the defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Perinatal physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In utero, pulmonary arterial blood flow in the fetus is limited by high pulmonary vascular resistance. As a result, the blood that flows into the right atrium is shunted across the isolated ASD into the left atrium, similar to the blood flow through the normal patent foramen ovale. At birth, left atrial pressure becomes greater than right atrial pressure resulting in left-to-right shunting across the defect. Initially, the volume of blood shunted from left to right is small because the right ventricle is still relatively thick-walled and noncompliant. As the right ventricle remodels in response to the decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, its compliance increases and the mean right atrial pressure decreases. As a result, the left-to-right shunting increases in volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life&quot;, section on 'Transition at delivery'</a>.)</p><p>In some neonates, transient right-to-left shunting may also occur during the cardiac and respiratory cycles, resulting in mild cyanosis. In these patients, there is a drop in atrial pressure at the onset of ventricular contraction due to atrial relaxation that is more rapid in the left than the right atrium. During inspiration, the decrease in intrathoracic pressure results in an increase in systemic venous return and a decrease in pulmonary venous return, decreasing left atrial pressure and increasing right atrial pressure, which results in right-to-left shunting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are several different forms of ASDs, the pathophysiology is similar.</p><p>With a small ASD, left atrial pressure is slightly higher than right atrial pressure, resulting in continuous flow of oxygenated blood from the left to the right atrium across the defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72533 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80448\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80448 \">movie 1</a>). The pressure gradient between the two atria and the amount of shunt flow depend upon the size of the defect and the relative distensibility of the right and left sides of the heart. Left-to-right shunting occurs primarily in late ventricular systole and early diastole, with some augmentation during atrial systole. Even when the right and left atrial pressures are equal, as will be seen with a large defect, left-to-right shunting still occurs because of the greater compliance of the right ventricle compared with the left ventricle.</p><p>The shunt flow constitutes a &quot;useless circuit&quot; through the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary circulation, left atrium, and defect back to the right atrium. Thus, the volume of blood flow in the pulmonary circulation is greater than that in the systemic circulation. The pulmonary flow to systemic flow ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(Qp/Qs)</span> can be over 3:1 in patients with large defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-left-to-right-shunts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of left-to-right shunts&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The increased flow leads to right-sided dilatation evident on chest radiograph and echocardiographic imaging. Right ventricular function is also occasionally decreased. The main pulmonary arteries dilate and the pulmonary vascularity is increased. These pulmonary vascular changes may be evident on the chest radiograph, and large vessels in both the lower and upper lobes may be seen. (See <a href=\"#H18284441\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> below.)</p><p>The right-sided volume overload is usually well tolerated for years. Heart failure is unusual before age 30, but the prevalence increases substantially in older uncorrected patients over time. Other complications in older patients include atrial arrhythmias such as flutter and fibrillation, thought to result from chronic stretching of the atrial muscle, and occasionally, pulmonary arteriopathy leading to progressive pulmonary hypertension resulting in right-to left shunting of blood (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H18283618\" class=\"local\">'Persistent moderate to large ASDs'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-prognosis-of-eisenmenger-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18285383\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated cardiovascular defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ASDs are often associated with other congenital cardiac anomalies. Although the associated defects are usually more important than the ASD itself, the ASD may in some cases contribute substantially to the physiology of the condition. As examples, an ASD permits mixing between the pulmonary and systemic circulations in complete transposition of the great arteries, while in tricuspid atresia, the entire cardiac output passes across the ASD.

As a result, the frequency of heart failure accompanied by fluid retention, hepatomegaly, and elevated jugular venous pressure increases with advancing age. Most such patients become symptomatic before 40 years of age. Common symptoms are palpitations reflecting atrial arrhythmias (the most frequent presenting symptom), exercise intolerance, dyspnea, and fatigue. Arrhythmias are thought to result from stretching of the atria by the increased shunting. In some patients, exercise intolerance may develop as early as the second decade of life.

In a retrospective study over a 10-year period from two tertiary centers, only 8 of 355 pediatric patients (2 percent) with isolated ASD had severe pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These eight infants (six with secundum and two with primum ASD) had elevated pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP) of 50 to 100 percent of systemic pressure and were operated on within the first year of life with subsequent normalization of PAP. These results highlight that elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in infants with ASDs is almost always reversible with correction, unlike the rare complication of fixed pulmonary vascular disease seen in affected adults.</p><p>In uncorrected older patients, severe irreversible pulmonary hypertension (Eisenmenger syndrome) may develop, and presents with signs of right ventricular failure resulting in right-to-left shunting. Clinical findings include cyanosis, dyspnea with exertion, hepatomegaly, and clubbing of the fingers and toes. These patients are also at risk for paradoxical embolization of clot from the venous system or right atrium via right-to-left shunting into the arterial system.

A similar finding is occasionally seen with normal pulmonary pressures because of the proximity of the dilated pulmonary artery to the chest wall. The second sound should be evaluated when the patient is sitting or standing, because relatively wide (though not fixed) splitting is common in normal individuals in the supine position.

The right atrium and ventricle are usually enlarged, while the left atrium and left ventricle are normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18284237\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of isolated atrial septal defect (ASD) is usually suspected clinically and is confirmed by echocardiography.</p><p>The principal features that suggest the presence of an ASD include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac auscultatory findings of a fixed splitting of the second heart sound and a midsystolic pulmonary flow or ejection murmur.

Shunt volume, shunt ratios, and pulmonary artery pressures can be measured with Doppler flow echocardiography.</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography is also often necessary to precisely measure atrial septal defect margins at the time of catheter closure of secundum ASDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93811\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93811 \">image 4</a>). Although transthoracic echocardiography is usually adequate to identify the presence of an ASD and determine overall defect size, transthoracic echocardiography is generally inferior to transesophageal echocardiography and intravascular echocardiography in characterizing the position and size of ASDs, while transesophageal echocardiography is superior in the sizing of defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79348\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79348 \">movie 4</a>), the diagnosis of sinus venosus defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93810\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93810 \">image 5</a>), and the assessment of associated congenital anomalies or other abnormalities such as mitral valve prolapse or anomalous venous connections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography more precisely measures ASD margins and, on occasion, may determine that ASD rims are inadequate for catheter device closure. Finally, not all patients have good acoustic windows for adequate transthoracic echocardiography visualization. False dropout of the thin fossa ovalis region of the atrial septum can occur even in childhood. Thus, transesophageal echocardiography prior to surgical sternotomy or planned interventional cardiac catheterization can provide an additional level of diagnostic assurance and sometimes prevent inadvisable or unnecessary therapeutic procedures.</p><p>These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H1039316238\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are classified based on their different anatomic locations, which generally reflects the abnormality of embryogenesis that led to the anomaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1039316786\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1039316630\" class=\"local\">'Embryology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Secundum ASDs account for approximately 70 percent of all ASDs and generally present as an isolated defect. It is a result of arrested growth of the secundum septum or excessive absorption of the primum septum resulting in an opening in the fossa ovalis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Secundum defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primum ASDs, which account for 15 to 20 percent of ASDs, develop when the septum primum does not fuse with the endocardial cushions resulting in a defect at the base of the interatrial septum that typically is associated with atrioventricular (AV) canal defects (eg, anomalies of the AV valves and ventricular septal defects). (See <a href=\"#H1039317071\" class=\"local\">'Primum defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less common forms of ASDs include sinus venosus defects, which are characterized by malposition of the insertion of the superior or inferior vena cava in the atrial septum, and coronary sinus ASDs, which occur when part or the entire wall between the coronary sinus and the left atrium is absent. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Sinus venosus defects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Coronary sinus defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although patent foramen ovale is also a potential open communication between the right and left atria, it is not considered an ASD because no septal tissue is missing. Interatrial shunting cannot occur as long as left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure and the flap valve remnant of septum primum of the foramen ovale is competent. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Patent foramen ovale'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiology of ASDs depends upon the relationship of pulmonary and systemic resistances, the compliance of the right and left ventricles, and the size of the defect. At birth, the blood flow shifts from a right-to-left to a left-to-right shunt through the septal defect as the left atrial pressure rises above the right atrial pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72533 \">figure 3</a>). This results in increased pulmonary blood flow, which is generally well tolerated for years in patients without correction of their ASDs. However, after 30 years of age, the incidence of heart failure and atrial arrhythmias increases with advancing age. Occasionally, pulmonary hypertension may develop, leading to right-to left shunting of blood, resulting in right ventricular failure and cyanosis (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18283618\" class=\"local\">'Persistent moderate to large ASDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural course of isolated ASDs varies with spontaneous closure, no change, or enlarging defect. Spontaneous closure is most likely to occur in younger patients with small defects. In patients with persistent uncorrected moderate to large defects, left-to-right shunting increases with age resulting in an increased risk of developing heart failure, atrial arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H1039317383\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may present prenatally, as antenatal echocardiography may detect some affected fetuses, especially those with primum ASDs. However, secundum ASDs cannot be reliably detected antenatally, and all suspected antenatal cases need to be confirmed by postnatal echocardiography. Postnatally, most patients present during a routine healthcare visit when an incidental heart murmur is detected. Infants with a large ASD may present with symptoms of heart failure (eg, tachypnea and dyspnea), recurrent respiratory infection, or failure to thrive.

Initial test findings may include an electrocardiographic QRS pattern suggestive of incomplete right bundle branch block (rSr' or rsR'), and chest radiography demonstrating cardiac enlargement (eg, right atrial and ventricular dilation) and increased pulmonary vascularity.
