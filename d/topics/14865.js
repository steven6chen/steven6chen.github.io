These insects feed on blood and will bite various animals and people, although humans are not a primary host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Triatoma bites are generally painless and asymptomatic. However, reactions can occur, ranging from local irritation at the site to allergic and anaphylactic reactions.</p><p>Triatomines are also of medical interest because they are the insect vectors for the protozoan <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em>, which causes Chagas disease. Triatoma and other closely related species found in the United States infrequently transmit <em>T. cruzi</em>, whereas the infection is endemic in some parts of South America. They do not transmit other human disease agents.</p><p>Local and allergic reactions to triatoma bites are discussed in this topic review. Chagas disease and public health measures to control populations of kissing bugs in endemic areas are presented elsewhere.

However, bite-induced anaphylaxis is less common than sting-related anaphylaxis, such as that induced by Hymenoptera species such as bees, wasps, and ants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persons at risk for triatoma bites are those living in poorly constructed houses in endemic areas, those sleeping with windows open at night, and people with homes situated in areas with an abundance of wild mammal hosts nearby, such as wood rats and other rodents, opossums, and armadillos.</p><p>In the United States, where homes are less easily penetrated, there is still evidence that Triatoma and humans regularly come into contact. In a study from California, 7 percent of the population possessed antibodies to <em>T. protracta</em> salivary antigens, suggesting that they had been fed on by these insects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A study of Triatoma captured in areas distant from human dwellings found that the majority of insects tested had recently ingested human blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTOMOLOGY OF TRIATOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kissing bugs belong to the insect family Reduviidae (sometimes called reduviid bugs), subfamily Triatominae, genus <em>Triatoma</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65111\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65111 \">figure 1</a>). Within the Triatominae subfamily, some (but not all) species are in the genus <em>Triatoma</em>. Thus, not all kissing bugs are Triatoma, and some non-Triatoma kissing bugs also may be vectors of Chagas disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triatoma are winged insects that are approximately 1.3 to 2.5 cm long with flattened, shield-shaped bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80447\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80447 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82769 \">picture 2</a>). The head is elongated and sometimes cone-shaped. They are various shades of brown or black, and some have prominent stripes of red, orange, or yellow color at the edges of the abdomen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Worldwide distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triatoma are primarily distributed throughout the western and southern United States, Central and South America, and in Mexico. Within the United States, there are at least 10 <em>Triatoma</em> species, but only about six of these are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61997\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61997 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Most reports of allergic reactions to bites have originated in the southwest and west, primarily due to <em>T. protracta</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. Kissing bugs may rarely be found in the northern United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Habitat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triatoma feed on blood from a variety of vertebrate hosts, such as rodents, opossums, other small and medium-sized mammals, birds, and humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They usually live with their animal hosts in rodent burrows, wood piles, or caves. As an example, <em>T. protracta</em> can frequently be found in wood rat nests.</p><p>Triatoma periodically fly away from their usual locations in nocturnal flights. During these flights, they may be attracted to porch lights on houses, and when daylight comes, they can crawl indoors through cracks around doors or windows in search of shelter from the sun and heat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Once indoors, they may feed on pets and people.</p><p>In the United States, human interactions with Triatoma are considered to be incidental encounters. Triatoma do not easily enter modern homes, and when they do, there is usually one or a small number of insects per home. However, large infestations can occur in homes in developing countries that have cracks and crevices, mud walls, and thatched roofs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/2,7,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,9,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Biting behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kissing bugs are active primarily at night, and are rarely sighted during the day. In addition, feeding takes place almost exclusively at night. The name kissing bugs arose from the tendency of certain species to bite near the lips, but the bugs will bite any area of exposed skin. They will not bite through clothing or bed sheets.</p><p>Bites are typically multiple, ranging from 2 to 15 in a cluster on one part of the body, most commonly the hands, arms, feet, head, and trunk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A full blood meal may take more than 30 minutes to complete, but the insect may be interrupted during this process and reinsert its proboscis several times in one area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The lifecycle includes an egg stage, five nymphal stages, and an adult stage. Maturation takes 5 to 12 months, depending on availability of blood meals and temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Some of these cause immediate pain, which does not occur with Triatoma bites. However, with the possible exception of some tick bites, identifying the insect inflicting the bite is of little clinical importance because local care is all that is required unless complications arise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of local reactions from kissing bug bites should be based upon symptoms, as there are no studies evaluating efficacy. Topical or oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids may be helpful for itching and local irritation, respectively. Oral or parenteral antibiotics should be considered if the lesion appears to be superinfected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bites of Triatoma have been recognized as a cause of allergic reactions for more than a century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

It usually develops within a few minutes to two hours of exposure to the causative trigger. As a result, anaphylaxis from Triatoma bites characteristically awakens the patient from sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This nocturnal presentation is rarely seen with other causes of anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is clinical and based primarily upon symptoms and signs, as well as a detailed description of the acute episode, including antecedent activities and events. Clinical criteria for the diagnosis and immediate management of anaphylaxis from all causes are discussed separately. There is no &quot;antivenom&quot; or other specific antidote for Triatoma-induced anaphylactic reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients survive, but a fatal case of anaphylaxis from a Triatoma bite on the leg was reported in a 54-year-old woman with no significant past medical history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Since most patients do not know that they have been bitten, the only other clues implicating Triatoma are identification of a bite on physical examination and, in patients in endemic areas for Triatoma, nocturnal anaphylaxis (which is otherwise uncommon).</p><p>The patient (or a family <span class=\"nowrap\">member/caregiver)</span> should carefully search the location where the bite took place as soon as possible, and try to retrieve the bug for identification. The engorged insect may be found in bedding, between mattresses, or <span class=\"nowrap\">in/under</span> upholstered furniture. Help from a licensed pest management professional may be needed in this effort. Successful location of the insect as a result of a thorough search was accomplished in &gt;95 percent of cases in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/8,12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,17</a>].</p><p>In addition to definitive identification, finding the insect is important in preventing further bites. Even low populations of Triatoma may lead to multiple biting events through time. However, blood-sucking insects usually require a period of digestion after feeding, so additional bites from the same insect are less likely to occur immediately. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance measures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mosquitoes, bed bugs, and various biting flies have also been implicated in rare cases of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactions-to-bites-from-kissing-bugs-primarily-genus-triatoma/abstract/21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-27</a>].

The responsible allergen is a carbohydrate, and this may underlie the atypical timing of these reactions, which occur three to six hours after ingestion. In contrast, most food-induced anaphylactic reactions are caused by allergy to proteins and occur within minutes to two hours of ingestion.

Stacks of wood or other materials should not be located near the house. Outdoor lights that are directed onto the exterior of homes should be turned to shine away from the house, so that the insects drawn to them are less likely to contact the building. Outdoor plantings near homes should be kept neatly trimmed to prevent nesting of wood rats and other natural hosts for Triatoma.</p><p>Bedrooms should be free of clutter on the floor, and bedding should not be allowed to touch the floor. Bed nets can be used, and long-sleeved and long-legged pajamas are suggested, since Triatoma rarely bite covered skin. Some recommend wearing insect repellent on the skin while sleeping in endemic areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Pesticide application</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In areas of the world where Chagas disease is endemic, kissing bugs are controlled with pesticides for the purpose of reducing disease incidence.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kissing bug bites are usually painless and undetected by the victim. However, these insects are of medical importance both because they can transmit the protozoan <em>T. cruzi</em>, which causes Chagas disease, and also because people can develop life-threatening allergic reactions to their bites. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Allergic reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Pathology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-epidemiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic <span class=\"nowrap\">reactions/anaphylaxis</span> to Triatoma bites typically occur in the middle of the night, as Triatoma are nocturnal and bite while the victim sleeps. With the exception of this one distinguishing feature, the signs and symptoms of Triatoma anaphylaxis may be identical to those resulting from other triggers. Fatal and near fatal cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Allergic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute treatment of anaphylaxis following a Triatoma bite is identical to acute treatment of anaphylaxis of any etiology. Upon discharge, all patients with anaphylaxis should be equipped with an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector and an anaphylaxis emergency action plan to manage initial treatment of recurrent episodes. Epinephrine should be kept at the bedside in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;, section on 'Immediate management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a patient with anaphylaxis has been stabilized, the home (or relevant site) should be thoroughly searched for the blood-engorged insect as soon as possible. If necessary, pest management professionals may be called upon to aid in the inspection process. Identification of the insect is important for diagnosis because reagents for skin testing and laboratory diagnosis are not available. Proper insect identification can be obtained from a local college or university entomology department or the extension service at participating land-grant universities nationwide. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Identification of the insect'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be given information about how to prevent future contact with Triatoma, including modifications of their homes, bedrooms, and surrounding environment. If kissing bugs are suspected to be present or found in the home, a pest management professional should be contacted. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific immunotherapy to reduce an allergic patient's sensitivity to Triatoma is not commercially available. Thus, avoidance and education about early recognition and treatment of recurrent allergic reactions is critical. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests and immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of local reactions are also possible following Triatoma bites, which may be managed symptomatically.
