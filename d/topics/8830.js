Among patients with AML, treatment regimens and outcomes may differ between younger and older adults. Although there is no clear dividing line between younger and older adults when dealing with AML, in most studies, &quot;older adults&quot; has been defined as over age 55 to 60 years.</p><p>The initial treatment of younger adults with de novo AML will be reviewed here.

Most remissions require only a single course. Approximately one-quarter to one-third of patients will require a second induction cycle to obtain a complete remission (CR). A &quot;double induction&quot; regimen where induction chemotherapy is quickly repeated for a second cycle is most frequently employed in Europe. The following sections review these different treatment options.</p><p>Acute promyelocytic leukemia is an important exception to the initial treatment of AML, as it has a distinct clinical presentation, complications, prognosis, and treatment.

HiDAC is associated with increased toxicity and its use during remission induction treatment does not appear to improve clinical outcomes when compared with standard dose cytarabine administered in combination with an anthracycline. Treatment-related mortality, the rate of early relapse, and overall survival (OS) are not clearly improved.

In an exploratory analysis, the overall response rate was 93 percent in patients with cytogenetically normal disease and 100 percent in patients with FLT3-ITD. Estimated median EFS and OS were 47 and 82 weeks. While these initial observations suggested a role for vorinostat in AML, a subsequent large randomized intergroup trial (NCT01802333) was suspended after this three-drug regimen was no better than a standard 7+3 regimen.</p><p>For younger adults with newly diagnosed AML, we recommend remission induction treatment with a combination of an anthracycline plus &quot;standard&quot; dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78251 \">table 3</a>) rather than HiDAC plus an anthracycline.

This approach has been used by some centers in Europe. The relative benefits provided from double induction chemotherapy compared with a single course of intensive post-remission chemotherapy or prolonged maintenance therapy are not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Rather than double induction chemotherapy for all patients, a second cycle of induction chemotherapy is given for those with gross residual disease, if needed. </p><p>Response to the initial induction treatment is evaluated with a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy seven days after completion of the first cycle of induction chemotherapy. This timing corresponds with the maximum cell killing effect of the initial treatment. The second course of induction is started with no further delay if cytologically evident residual disease (greater than 5 to 10 percent of the marrow volume) is found and the patient is expected to tolerate further therapy. If the patient is unlikely to tolerate further therapy due to complications or deconditioning, a bone marrow evaluation is typically repeated in one to two weeks allowing the patient to recover some degree of fitness prior to administering further therapy. Advances in supportive care (especially antifungal therapy) for patients with marrow hypoplasia and pancytopenia have allowed this shift in focus away from attaining a remission as quickly as possible in the setting of complications. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of response'</a> below.) </p><p>The goal of subsequent induction therapy is to adequately clear the marrow of leukemia cells to allow recovery of normal hematopoiesis within the next two to three weeks. It is unknown which of the following strategies is most successful when used for a second induction course with refractory AML: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeating the initial course (eg, 7+3)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeating the initial drugs at reduced doses to reduce cumulative toxicity (eg, 5+2)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Switching to a different treatment (eg, HiDAC)</p><p/><p>Given the paucity of prospective data, the preferred choice among these options is widely debated. Some argue that it does not make sense to use the same (ie, 7+3) or lesser (ie, 5+2) chemotherapy to treat residual disease that was resistant to initial induction. Others argue that residual disease on day 14 may be more susceptible to these drugs on second exposure because the initial course results in an increased growth fraction of residual blasts promoted into the cell cycle. More aggressive therapy may have a greater anti-leukemic benefit but also may increase the risk of death during induction due to toxicity. </p><p>A decision to use one of these regimens in this setting may be individualized according to the clinical status of the patient and the amount of disease remaining in the day 14 bone marrow biopsy. As an example, for a young adult who is medically well and has a high fraction of blasts (eg, 60 to 80 percent blasts) remaining in a cellular marrow (eg, 50 to 100 percent cellularity), which indicates primary refractory disease, one may prefer switching to a different treatment (eg, 8 to 12 doses of HiDAC or a combination using HiDAC plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a>) rather than administering 7+3 a second time. This choice accepts a higher potential for treatment complications in return for a more aggressive tumor cell kill. In contrast, 5+2 may be preferred for an older patient unlikely to tolerate more aggressive therapy or for a patient of any age with few blasts (eg, 10 percent) remaining in a hypocellular marrow (eg, 10 to 20 percent cellularity). &#160; &#160;</p><p>Initial data suggest that molecular profiling may help to individualize second induction courses in the future (eg, AML with a <em>TP53 </em>mutation or inv(3) is less likely to respond to anthracyclines). Alternatively, patients with certain gene mutations (eg, <em>IDH1</em>,<em> IDH2</em>, <em>MLL </em>rearranged leukemia, or <em>FLT3</em>) may be candidates for targeted therapy in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING DURING TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy for AML is highly toxic, primarily to the hematopoietic system and most patients will have a prolonged hospital stay and will require blood product support. The following are offered as guidelines for monitoring during induction chemotherapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily laboratory testing should be performed and generally includes a complete blood count and chemistries with renal function, glucose, and electrolytes. Calcium, phosphorus, and uric acid levels should be monitored until normal. Liver function tests should be assessed at least weekly.

The difference in the rate of severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> oral mucositis (the primary endpoint) in the palifermin group was not statistically significant (4 versus 10 percent), a finding attributed to the lower than expected rate of mucositis in the control group. There was a significantly lower rate of severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> gastrointestinal adverse events (diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis) in the palifermin arm (14 versus 37 percent), but this was mainly due to a reduction in severe diarrhea (8 versus 26 percent).

Malignant myeloblasts do express receptors for these growth factors. Their use in this setting has been studied both in an attempt to decrease the duration of neutropenia and to potentially sensitize or &quot;prime&quot; leukemia cells for chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].
