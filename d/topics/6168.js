The vast majority of cases occur sporadically. In adults and children, the primary clinical features are hyperphagia, usually leading to early-onset obesity, hypogonadism, developmental delay, and characteristic facial features. In infants, the most prominent findings are hypotonia and feeding difficulties.</p><p>The epidemiology and genetics of PWS will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and approaches to treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1887, Langdon-Down described the first girl with probable Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), manifest by mental impairment, short stature, hypogonadism, and obesity; he termed the condition polysarcia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Seventy years later, Prader and colleagues reported a series of patients with similar phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 1981, Ledbetter, et al, identified microdeletions within chromosome 15 as the site for PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most common syndromic form of obesity and affects between 350,000 and 400,000 individuals worldwide. Both sexes are affected equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Although prevalence estimates differ among studies, this is likely due to using different methods for case identification, and there is no strong evidence for increased risk in specific countries or gene pools. Within the United States, the rate of prevalence has been reported between 1 in 16,062 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] to 1 in 25,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Outside of the United States, reported prevalence rates for PWS range from 1 per 8,000 in rural Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] to 1 per 16,000 in Western Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], 1:15,830 in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and a birth incidence of 1 per 27,000 in Flanders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Within the United Kingdom, a lower population prevalence of 1 in 52,000 was estimated, with a proposed true prevalence of 1 in 45,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In each of these populations, PWS represents a very small fraction of children with obesity, or even severe obesity.</p><p>The prevalence of PWS is higher in populations referred for the key clinical features. One study reported PWS in 11 percent of infants referred for hypotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prevalence of PWS among individuals with intellectual disability is less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS AND PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) was the first genetic disorder attributed to genomic imprinting, meaning that the expression of the gene depends on the gender of the parent donating the gene. PWS arises due to the loss of the paternal copy of the PWS &quot;critical region&quot; on chromosome 15q11.2-13, whereas loss of the maternal copy of 15q11.2-13 results in Angelman syndrome. The majority of cases of PWS arise sporadically. Monozygotic twins are concordantly affected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H1457606458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Parent-of-origin effects (imprinting)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22#H8964746\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)&quot;, section on '15q11-13 paternal deletion syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome)'</a>.)</p><p>Between 65 and 75 percent of cases of PWS arise from deletion of paternal 15q11.2-13, and 20 to 30 percent of cases arise from maternal uniparental disomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61992 \">table 1</a>). The proportion caused by maternal uniparental disomy is as high as 50 percent in the most recent series, and this was attributed to advancing maternal age as well as improved techniques for molecular diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. About 2 percent of cases are caused by a defect in the imprinting center; most of these are epimutations, and a small fraction (&lt;0.5 percent of PWS cases) are caused by deletions. Very rarely, PWS is caused by a balanced translocation (&lt;0.1 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Determining the type of mutation has implications for recurrence risk. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk of recurrence in future pregnancies'</a> below.)</p><p>There appears to be some association between the type of genetic defect and the phenotypic features seen in an individual with PWS. Individuals with uniparental disomy generally have less distinct physical features, higher intelligence quotients (IQs), and milder behavioral problems than individuals with PWS caused by deletions. However, patients with uniparental disomy are also more likely to exhibit autistic-like behaviors and psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14 or microdeletions of the 14q32.2 imprinted region has been associated with a PWS-like phenotype, especially during infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of recurrence in future pregnancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of PWS in siblings of an affected child depends on the type of molecular defect causing PWS in that individual. Thus, genetic testing is important not only to establish the diagnosis of PWS, but to determine the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies.</p><p>The recurrence risk is less than one percent if the affected child has a deletion or maternal disomy, or an imprinting defect without a deletion (an epimutation). Two rare molecular defects that cause PWS are associated with a higher recurrence risk: if the affected child has a deletion of the imprinting control center (representing a small fraction of those with imprinting defects and less than 0.5 percent of PWS cases), the recurrence risk for siblings is up to 50 percent; if the affected child has a parental chromosomal rearrangement (representing less than 1 percent of PWS cases), the recurrence risk for siblings is up to 25 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61992 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome&quot;, section on 'Genetic testing'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several genes have been mapped to the 15q11.2-13 region. Genetic analysis of many different individuals with PWS progressively narrowed the candidate region, and it now appears that the major manifestations of PWS are caused by paternal deficiency for SNORD116-1 (HBII-85) &quot;small nucleolar RNA&quot; (snoRNA) cluster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. SnoRNAs are noncoding molecules that guide post-transcriptional modification of ribosomal RNA and other small nuclear RNAs. The modifications include methylation, which is the mechanism for sex-specific imprinting. The precise mechanisms through which HBII-85 deletions cause the clinical features of PWS have not been established. </p><p>SNORD116-1 and several other snoRNA clusters are located just downstream of the SNURF-SNRPN, NDN (necdin), MAGEL2, and MKRN3 genes, explaining the apparent association of PWS with these candidate genes in previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. These genes, or others in the PWS region, may account for some associated features but are unlikely to be exclusive causes. As an example, truncating mutations in MAGEL2 have been identified in four patients with autism spectrum disorder and some or all of the clinical features of PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Also, the P gene encodes for tyrosinase-positive albinism and is likely responsible for the hypopigmentation observed in 30 percent of individuals with PWS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR GENETIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molecular testing for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is highly sensitive, as standard panels with a methylation analysis will detect over 99 percent of PWS cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For probands with a strong clinical suspicion of PWS, the testing is done in a sequence that allows identification of all potential genetic defects.

If microsatellite markers detect no uniparental disomy, then a mutation or deletion in the imprinting center is suspected. Further sequencing diagnostic studies may be required to determine the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. The majority of imprinting defects are &quot;epimutations&quot;, in which the imprint, but not the underlying DNA sequence, is abnormal; in these cases the recurrence risk for future pregnancies is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/16,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24</a>].
