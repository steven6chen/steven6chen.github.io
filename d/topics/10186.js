It is also classified as glycogen storage disease type II (GSD II) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54417\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54417 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. GAA deficiency leads to accumulation of glycogen within the lysosome in all tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81164 \">figure 1</a>). The defect in the lysosomal GAA enzyme affects lysosomal-mediated degradation of glycogenesis, unlike the defects in most other GSDs that affect glycogen synthesis or regulation of energy production. Therapies developed for GAA deficiency resemble those used for other lysosomal storage diseases since they share similar disease mechanisms.

Serum creatine kinase is typically elevated in all types of GAA deficiency, and leukocyte GAA activity is usually decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. GAA activity is also decreased to less than 10 percent of normal in other tissues, such as fibroblasts and muscle. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Muscle biopsy reveals vacuolar myopathy with glycogen storage within lysosomes and free glycogen in the cytoplasm by electron microscopy. The vacuoles are periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive, digestible by diastase, and positive for acid phosphatase.

The classic infantile form is characterized by cardiomyopathy and severe, generalized muscular hypotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Clinical findings present at a median age of approximately four months, including cardiomegaly (92 percent), respiratory distress (78 percent), muscle weakness (63 percent), feeding difficulties (57 percent), and failure to thrive (53 percent) in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The tongue may be enlarged. Hepatomegaly also may be present and is usually due to heart failure. There is no metabolic derangement. An early-onset &quot;nonclassic&quot; phenotype presenting with hypotonia without cardiomyopathy during the first one to two years of life has also has been described.

In a multinational survey of 255 children and adults (aged 2.6 to 81 years) with late-onset GAA deficiency, the age at first complaint ranged from 0 to 62 years and the age at diagnosis from 0 to 66 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a survey of 54 Dutch patients, the mean age of onset of symptoms was 28 years, but 18 percent of patients had symptoms before age 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Clinical and histologic features are also variable and can range from asymptomatic to severe, progressive myopathy with typical histologic features. In the juvenile and adult form, the primary clinical finding is skeletal myopathy, with a more protracted course leading to respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Early involvement of the diaphragm is a common feature, and sleep-disordered breathing may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This usually leads to respiratory failure and death in the second or third decade of life. Older children with GAA deficiency usually do not have cardiomegaly.</p><p>Adult patients also present with progressive, proximal weakness in a limb-girdle distribution, particularly the hip flexors in the earliest stages of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The weakness is accompanied by diaphragmatic involvement, leading to respiratory insufficiency early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Three patients over the age of 50 years were diagnosed when they presented with camptocormia (severe anterior flexion of the spine, also called bent spine syndrome) despite initial development of symptoms prior to 21 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These patients were found to be compound heterozygous for the c.-32-13T&gt;G mutation and another Pompe disease mutation. Dilative arteriopathy, carotid artery dissection, and basilar artery dolichoectasia have been reported in a small number of patients with late-onset GAA deficiency; however, the real incidence of these vascular complications is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Both upper gastrointestinal and, less commonly, lower gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported, including swallowing difficulties, gastroesophageal reflux, diarrhea, and constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>].</p><p>In a review that included 74 patients with nonclassic GAA deficiency who had a muscle biopsy, 97 percent reported lysosomal pathology, although 15 had normal glycogen content (including 13 who were over 18 years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of early-onset GAA deficiency should be suspected in an infant with profound hypotonia and cardiac insufficiency. Elevations of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are commonly seen. The electrocardiogram reveals a short PR interval with giant QRS complexes in all leads, suggesting biventricular hypertrophy, although this is not unique to GAA deficiency.</p><p>The late-onset form of GAA deficiency should be suspected in children and adults with progressive proximal weakness in a limb-girdle distribution. The electromyogram is characteristic, with evidence of myopathic discharges that are sometimes associated with abundant myotonic and complex repetitive discharges, most prominently in the paraspinal muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The forced vital capacity (FVC) on pulmonary function testing typically is reduced substantially in adults. The forearm ischemic lactate test is normal in patients with GAA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

This assay is available through clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">biochemical/genetics</span> diagnostic laboratories. The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acarbose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acarbose</a>, an inhibitor that blocks interfering alpha-glucosidase present in granulocytes, to enzyme assays performed with blood samples is recommended because it improves the sensitivity of the assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The assay of GAA enzyme activity is a reliable detection tool for the diagnosis of all forms of GAA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/13,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,36</a>]. Measurement of GAA activity in another tissue (skin fibroblast or muscle) is useful when results of the assay performed on a blood sample are ambiguous or in the indeterminate range.</p><p>Gene sequencing is the preferred test to confirm the diagnosis since it is routinely available, is less invasive, may provide genotype-phenotype information, and may help predict cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status (amount of residual endogenous GAA production) in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The finding of two pathogenic mutations in trans in the <em>GAA</em> gene is considered confirmatory. Assay of GAA enzyme activity in fibroblasts can be performed as the confirmatory test in patients that require skin biopsy for antibody-based analysis to determine CRIM status. Measurement of GAA activity in muscle obtained by biopsy is another option for confirming the diagnosis, but this approach is complicated by increased invasiveness, anesthesia, and the potential for false positives due to poor sample processing.</p><p>Urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc(4)) is elevated in patients with GAA deficiency. It is useful as an adjunctive diagnostic test, as well as for monitoring treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

More than 206,000 newborns (approximately 45 percent) were screened. Repeat samples and additional evaluation were required for less than 1 percent of infants. Six infants were detected through screening. The number of infants with confirmed GAA deficiency was similar in the screened and unscreened populations, but the infants who were screened were diagnosed earlier (less than one month versus three to six months of age). In a follow-up analysis from January 2008 to January 2014, 47 of 669,797 infants screened were referred for evaluation, and 14 were diagnosed with infantile-onset Pompe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>In a statewide pilot study in Illinois in the United States from November 2014 through August 2016, there were 139 positive or borderline tests for GAA deficiency with 10 cases confirmed (two with the infantile form and the rest with late-onset disease) out of 219,793 infants screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The two cases with early-onset disease had evidence of cardiomyopathy and were started on ERT, whereas the eight infants diagnosed with late-onset disease were asymptomatic and will be followed over time (therapy will commence once active disease is noted).

It is caused by mutations in the gene for lysosomal acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase. Deficiency of lysosomal GAA leads to accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes and cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81164 \">figure 1</a>), which results in tissue destruction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infantile form (early onset) of GAA deficiency is characterized by cardiomyopathy and severe, generalized hypotonia. Most patients with this form die within the first year or two of life without treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Infantile form'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1728246913\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The juvenile and adult form (late onset) is characterized by skeletal myopathy (usually in a limb-girdle distribution) and a protracted course leading to respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile and adult form'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1728246913\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infantile-onset GAA deficiency should be suspected in infants with profound hypotonia and cardiac insufficiency. Juvenile or adult-onset GAA deficiency should be considered in patients with progressive weakness in a limb-girdle distribution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Supportive findings may include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrocardiogram demonstrating short PR interval and giant QRS complexes in all leads, suggesting biventricular hypertrophy, although this is a nonspecific finding (infantile form).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electromyogram demonstrating myopathic discharges, sometimes associated with abundant myotonic and complex repetitive discharges, most prominent in the paraspinal muscles (juvenile and adult form).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elevated serum creatine kinase (all forms).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Demonstration of reduced GAA activity in a dried blood spot or leukocytes, followed by sequencing of the <em>GAA</em> gene, confirms the disease. Enzyme activity assays using skin fibroblasts or muscle tissue are alternatives to genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GAA deficiency is treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), physical and occupational therapy, and supportive care (eg, mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The advent of ERT has improved clinical outcomes and survival for both early- and late-onset GAA deficiency. However, patients on ERT may still develop gradual pelvic girdle muscle weakness. Additional complications may include fractures and sleep-disordered breathing.
