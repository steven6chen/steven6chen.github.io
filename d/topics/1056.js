They are made by the body's infection-fighting system, which is also called the immune system.</p><p>Normally, a person's immune system makes antibodies when he or she gets an infection. The antibodies attack the germs causing the infection.</p><p>If a person's immune system isn't working normally, it sometimes makes antibodies that attack his or her own body. This is called an autoimmune disease. Antibodies that attack a person's own body are also called autoantibodies. ANA are specific autoantibodies that attack substances inside of cells.</p><p>Autoantibodies can damage different parts of the body, including the blood, skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, and nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82309622\"><span class=\"h1\">What is an ANA test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ANA test is a blood test that measures the amount of ANA in your blood.</p><p>A &quot;negative&quot; result means that you have no (or very little) ANA in your blood.</p><p>A &quot;positive&quot; result means that you have ANA in your blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82309637\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might a doctor or nurse order an ANA test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A doctor or nurse will order an ANA test to help figure out if you have an autoimmune disease. Many types of autoimmune diseases can cause a positive ANA test result. Some autoimmune diseases affect the whole body. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scleroderma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed connective tissue disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymyositis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatomyositis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis</p><p/><p>Other autoimmune diseases affect only one part of the body, such as the thyroid (a gland in the neck), liver, or lungs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82309652\"><span class=\"h1\">What does a negative ANA test result mean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a negative result, you probably do <strong>not</strong> have an autoimmune disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82309667\"><span class=\"h1\">What does a positive ANA test result mean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a positive result, you might have an autoimmune disease.</p><p>It's important to know that a positive result does not always mean a person has an autoimmune disease. Some people with a positive ANA result do not have an autoimmune disease and never get one. The higher the number (called the &quot;titer&quot;) of your ANA test, the greater the chance that you have an autoimmune disease.</p><p>Also, some people with a positive ANA result do not have an autoimmune disease, but have an infection instead.</p><p>To figure out whether you have an autoimmune disease, your doctor will also learn about your symptoms, do an exam, and order other lab tests. He or she might order blood tests that look for more specific autoantibodies. These can help your doctor figure out which type of autoimmune disease you might have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82309682\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatomyositis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dermatomyositis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyositis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Polymyositis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-scleroderma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Systemic scleroderma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarteritis-nodosa-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Polyarteritis nodosa (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vasculitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sjogrens-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=antinuclear-antibodies-ana-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=antinuclear-antibodies-ana-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyositis-dermatomyositis-and-other-forms-of-idiopathic-inflammatory-myopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and other forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vasculitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sjogrens-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
