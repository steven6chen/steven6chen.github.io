These clusters are called &quot;granulomas.&quot; If many granulomas form in an organ, they can keep the organ from working normally. For example, granulomas can form in the lungs and cause breathing problems.</p><p>Sarcoidosis can affect many different organs. Often it affects the lungs, but it can also affect the skin, eyes, nose, and lots of other body parts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481783480\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of sarcoidosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcoidosis causes different symptoms depending on which body part it affects. Often the symptoms are mild and go away on their own.</p><p>When it affects the lungs, sarcoidosis can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness or weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p>When it affects the skin, sarcoidosis can cause a mild rash or painful bumps. Sometimes the rash and bumps go away completely. Other times, they leave a scar.</p><p>Sometimes, sarcoidosis causes no symptoms even though it is damaging certain organs. For this reason, people with sarcoidosis might need to have tests to check for organ damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481783487\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I have sarcoidosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single &quot;test&quot; that can tell if you have sarcoidosis. To diagnose it, doctors and nurses look at:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms and your physical exam</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays (or special X-rays called CT scans)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab work on tissue taken from your body (called a biopsy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests that can rule out other causes of your condition</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481783494\"><span class=\"h1\">How is sarcoidosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors and nurses do not know what causes sarcoidosis, so they do not have a treatment to cure it. Luckily, they do have ways to treat its symptoms. Even so, if your symptoms are mild, you might not need treatment.</p><p>Medicines called steroids can relieve the symptoms of sarcoidosis and prevent some of the damage it can cause. These steroid medicines are not the kind that athletes take to build up muscle. These steroids reduce swelling and shrink the granulomas caused by sarcoidosis. Sometimes, people can use skin creams, eye drops, and inhalers that have steroids in them. Other times, if their symptoms are severe, they take steroid pills.</p><p>Even though steroid pills can help with the problems caused by sarcoidosis, they can also cause problems of their own. For instance, steroids can cause weight gain and mood swings, and make diabetes worse. For this reason, doctors and nurses try to take people off steroids as soon as possible.</p><p>Medicines besides steroids can also help with sarcoidosis. Doctors and nurses usually use these medicines only in people who cannot take steroids or who do not get better with steroids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481783501\"><span class=\"h1\">How will sarcoidosis affect my life?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcoidosis usually goes away on its own or does not get worse. Sometimes it does get worse and can spread to many organs. Even so, people do not usually die from sarcoidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481783508\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoidosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sarcoidosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
