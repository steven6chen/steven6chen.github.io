Cardioversion is the delivery of energy that is synchronized to the QRS complex, while defibrillation is the nonsynchronized delivery of a shock randomly during the cardiac cycle. In 1956, alternating current (AC) for transthoracic defibrillation was first used to treat ventricular fibrillation in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Following this breakthrough, in 1962 direct current (DC) defibrillators were introduced into clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Subsequent studies in the early 1960s demonstrated that electrical countershock or cardioversion across the closed chest could abolish other cardiac arrhythmias in addition to ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation. The clinical indications for these procedures, procedural sedation, potential side effects, and the use of the automated external defibrillator (AED) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardioversion for specific arrhythmias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-external-defibrillators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated external defibrillators&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27614653\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON DEFIBRILLATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most defibrillators are energy-based, meaning that the devices charge a capacitor to a selected voltage and then deliver a prespecified amount of energy in joules. The amount of energy that arrives at the myocardium is dependent upon the selected voltage and the transthoracic impedance (which varies by patient).</p><p>Two other types of defibrillators are used less frequently in clinical practice:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impedance-based defibrillators allow selection of transthoracic current based upon the transthoracic impedance; the latter is assessed initially with a test pulse with the capacitor subsequently charged to the appropriate voltage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current-based defibrillation, in which a fixed dose of current is delivered, results in defibrillation thresholds that are independent of transthoracic impedance and are invariant for the individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Defibrillation success for a current-based method is independent of both transthoracic impedance and body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, this method achieves defibrillation with considerably less energy than does the conventional energy-based method.</p><p/><p>Defibrillators can also deliver energy in a variety of waveforms, broadly characterized as monophasic or biphasic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51842\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51842 \">figure 1</a>). Initially defibrillators delivered only monophasic waveforms. Although monophasic defibrillation is highly effective, biphasic defibrillation terminates arrhythmias more consistently and at lower energy levels. Biphasic defibrillators have largely replaced monophasic defibrillators. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monophasic versus biphasic waveforms'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY OF DEFIBRILLATION AND CARDIOVERSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardioversion terminates arrhythmias by delivering a synchronized shock that depolarizes the tissue involved in a reentrant circuit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52134 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82249 \">figure 3</a>). By depolarizing all excitable tissue of the circuit and making the tissue refractory, the circuit is no longer able to propagate or sustain reentry. As a result, cardioversion terminates those arrhythmias resulting from a single reentrant circuit, such as atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, or monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite its widespread clinical use, controversy remains concerning the electrophysiologic mechanisms by which electrical cardioversion or defibrillation terminates atrial or ventricular fibrillation, arrhythmias which involve multiple microreentrant circuits. Fibrillation involves the entire atrial or ventricular myocardium and is considered to be a very persistent rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of VF'</a>.)</p><p>Most investigators agree that defibrillation occurs when a certain amount of current density reaches the myocardium. However, it is unclear what amount of current density is needed and what energy setting is necessary to achieve a homogeneous current density. At the cellular level, the delivered current flows around and through the myocardial cells, resulting in alteration of the transmembrane potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At the organ level, the mechanisms responsible for termination of fibrillation are still controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Two explanations have been proposed, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive: the critical mass hypothesis and the upper limit of vulnerability.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Critical mass hypothesis &ndash; There is general agreement that total elimination of fibrillatory activity can be achieved with relatively high defibrillation energy levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. According to the critical mass hypothesis, a certain amount of myocardium must be available to sustain atrial or ventricular fibrillation and the entire myocardium must be uniformly depolarized in order to terminate the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Electrophysiological evidence to support this theory has been obtained using a computerized mapping system that recorded simultaneous electrograms from 120 sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Defibrillation was successful only when fibrillatory activity was annihilated at all sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper limit of vulnerability hypothesis &ndash; According to the upper limit of vulnerability hypothesis, low-energy shocks can induce fibrillation up to a limit where further increases in energy do not induce fibrillation, and the largest shocks that do not induce fibrillation are slightly weaker than necessary for defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although shocks abolish small areas of localized reentry during ventricular fibrillation, shocks at strengths below the upper limit of vulnerability stimulate other regions of myocardium during their vulnerable period, giving rise to new areas of local reentry that reinitiate ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. To successfully defibrillate, therefore, the shock strength must be greater than the largest shock that reinitiates fibrillation (the upper limit of vulnerability). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that almost identical changes in the upper limit of vulnerability and the defibrillation threshold occur with changes in electrode polarity and waveform duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Transcardiac shocks of up to 30 joules were delivered to canine myocardial tissue at different times of the cardiac cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A shock applied 10 milliseconds (msec) before the end of the refractory period extended the refractory period by 63 msec, whereas the same shock given 40 msec earlier produced only a 25 msec increase in the refractory period. In contrast, a five-joule shock applied at the same times during the cardiac cycle produced only a 36 and 10 msec increase in the refractory period, respectively.</p><p>Because the higher intensity shock selectively extends the refractory period of the myocardium, it may establish a zone of tissue in which repolarization is delayed. This zone is always immediately in front of the newly depolarized tissue, and the inability of the depolarizing impulse to propagate across these refractory zones may be the mechanism responsible for terminating fibrillation. The size of these zones and the duration of increased refractoriness both increase with increasing shock intensity; this may account for the relatively high shock energies required for defibrillation relative to the intensities required to directly depolarize the tissue.</p><p>An electrical shock will also induce different degrees of action potential duration prolongation and dispersion of ventricular repolarization, depending upon shock strength and timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One study, performed during the post-implantation testing of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, found that shocks delivered on the T wave generated variable degrees of action potential prolongation, depending upon myocardial repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The creation of high dispersion of repolarization facilitated reentry by creating functional blocks and subsequently favored the induction of ventricular fibrillation and the prevention of its termination by a shock.</p><p>Defibrillation and cardioversion do not appear to cause significant myocardial necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

As an example, in one study of 301 patients, sinus rhythm was restored in 87 percent using an anteroposterior position compared with 76 percent with an anterolateral orientation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In the same study, the mean energy required for successful cardioversion was lower in patients with an anteroposterior electrode position (237 versus 287 joules) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>However, other reports have failed to confirm these findings and suggest that there is no clear advantage to either electrode configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In some patients one, but not the other position, may be effective.

One study analyzed the outcome of cardiac arrests in 105 patients using self-adhesive defibrillator pads of different sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A single shock of 200 joules was successful in 31 percent of cardiac arrests using two small pads (each 8 cm in diameter), in 63 percent with one small and one large pad (8 and 12 cm in diameter), and in 82 percent when two large pads (each 12 cm in diameter) were used.</p><p>A larger pad or paddle surface is associated with a decrease in resistance and increase in current and may cause less myocardial necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. However, there appears to be an optimal electrode size (approximately 12.8 cm) above which any further increase in electrode area causes a decline in current density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Hand-held versus patch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of hand-held paddle electrodes may be more effective than self-adhesive patch electrodes.

Therefore, the decision to use hand-held or self-adhesive electrodes should be made based on the available equipment and the opinion of the operator regarding which electrodes are more likely to be effective for the patient at hand. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Monophasic versus biphasic waveforms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defibrillators can deliver energy in a variety of waveforms that are broadly characterized as monophasic or biphasic. Defibrillators developed prior to 2000 deliver a monophasic wave of direct electrical current. Since then, &quot;biphasic&quot; devices, which reverse current polarity 5 to 10 milliseconds after discharge begins, have been developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51842\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51842 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Biphasic waveforms defibrillate more effectively and at lower energies than monophasic waveforms.

However, monophasic defibrillation is still highly effective in most situations, and it is not clear that the superior efficacy of biphasic defibrillation results in important clinical advantages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h4\">Ventricular fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several randomized trials have compared monophasic and biphasic waveforms in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Optimized Response to Cardiac Arrest (ORCA) trial, 115 patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation were randomly assigned to defibrillation using a 150 joule biphasic shock or traditional high-energy (200 to 360 joules) monophasic shocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Successful defibrillation was significantly more likely with biphasic waveforms compared with monophasic waveforms after one shock and total treatment under Emergency Medical Services care (96 versus 59, and 100 versus 84 percent respectively). In addition, the rate of return of spontaneous circulation was higher with biphasic shock therapy (76 versus 54 percent).</p><p/><p>However, there was no difference in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the two therapies.

Defibrillation was initially performed by Emergency Medical Service with an automated external defibrillator (AED), and if necessary, with a manual defibrillator by paramedics who arrived later. Patients were included only if all shocks were delivered with the same waveform. In contrast to the ORCA trial, in TIMBER the defibrillation energies were the same for both waveforms (200 followed by 200 and then 360 joules).</p><p/><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms with regard to the success of initial shocks, the rate of survival, or neurologic outcomes. However, biphasic defibrillation did result in nonsignificant trends towards earlier return of spontaneous circulation and increased overall survival (41 versus 34 percent, compared with monophasic defibrillation).</p><p>There is no clear explanation for the discrepant findings in these three trials. Due to the complexities and urgencies associated with resuscitation, in combination with the small sample sizes available for controlled studies, it is difficult to demonstrate or exclude important clinical benefits.

The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of successful defibrillation with the first shock was the same in both groups (37 versus 38 percent in the escalating higher and fixed lower treatment groups, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients requiring multiple shocks (n = 106), patients assigned to the escalating higher-energy protocol were significantly more likely to be successfully cardioverted (37 versus 25 percent, compared with patients assigned to the fixed lower-energy protocol).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no significant differences between regimens in adverse events including cardiac enzyme elevation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no differences between regimens in survival outcomes, although this could be due in part to the relatively small sample size. </p><p/><p>Based upon the absence of adverse events and the greater efficacy in patients requiring multiple shocks, we agree with the use of escalating higher-energy shocks with biphasic defibrillators in the treatment of cardiac arrest due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia that does not respond to an initial lower energy shock.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2155703\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient-related variables</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Transthoracic impedance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To compensate for transthoracic impedance during transthoracic defibrillation, a considerably larger current must be delivered to the thorax than is required for internal defibrillation. Impedance results in the dissipation of energy due to shunting to the lungs, the thoracic cage, and other elements of the chest. In an animal study, 82 percent of the transthoracic current was shunted to the thoracic cage, 14 percent to the lungs, and only 4 percent passed through to the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Transthoracic impedance is determined by multiple factors including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Energy level</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrode-to-skin interface</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interelectrode distance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrode pressure (with hand-held electrodes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase of ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial tissue and blood conductive properties</p><p/><p>In animals, repetitive shocks delivered at three minute intervals decrease the transthoracic impedance to a greater extent than repetitive shocks delivered at 15 or 60 second intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Similar trends have been reported in humans, but the changes in impedance were not found to be clinically relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. With repeated shocks, impedance decreased by as much as 8 percent and the peak current increased by 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Therefore, despite only a minimally larger amount of energy being delivered to the heart, an unsuccessful shock should be followed promptly by a higher energy shock.</p><p>An animal study examined the mechanisms responsible for the decline in transthoracic impedance after direct current (DC) shocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. After three 100-joule shocks, there was an 11 percent decline in transthoracic impedance which correlated with a tenfold increase in skeletal muscle blood flow. This observation suggests that tissue edema contributes to the DC shock-induced decline in transthoracic impedance.</p><p>A second report evaluated the effect of prior sternotomy on transthoracic impedance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Transthoracic impedance decreased after sternotomy and remained below preoperative measurements even after wound healing was complete, suggesting that the hyperemia, inflammation, tissue edema, and pleural effusion associated with sternotomy were the major contributors to the reduction in impedance.</p><p>The phase of ventilation is another factor that alters transthoracic impedance. Inspiration (and the increased volume of air within the lungs) is associated with a 13 percent higher transthoracic impedance than expiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>The composition of the gel used during cardioversion also affects the transthoracic impedance. In a study comparing a non-salt-containing gel with a salt-containing gel, transthoracic impedance was 20 percent higher with the non-salt-containing gel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of arrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of arrhythmia and the patient's clinical condition are important determinants of defibrillation success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. As an example, patients with ventricular fibrillation as the primary event are easier to defibrillate than patients with secondary ventricular fibrillation resulting from uncompensated congestive heart failure and hypotension.</p><p>The different energy requirements between organized and non-organized arrhythmias may be related to the electrophysiologic characteristics of the arrhythmia. Organized arrhythmias, such as sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, arise from a discrete reentrant circuit which is easily depolarized by smaller amounts of current [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. In contrast, in non-organized rhythms such as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, the wavefronts are multiple and involve more myocardial mass, thereby requiring more energy for termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The electrical current and energy required to terminate ventricular tachyarrhythmias vary by arrhythmia. Ventricular tachycardia generally requires less energy than ventricular fibrillation. In one study of 203 patients who received 569 shocks for ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, the heart rate and electrocardiographic degree of organization of the tachycardia were important determinants of transthoracic energy and the current requirements for cardioversion or defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Transthoracic termination of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia required relatively low energy (70 to 100 joules) while polymorphic ventricular tachycardia required more energy (150 to 200 joules).</p><p>The varying energy requirements for cardioversion for ventricular tachyarrhythmias are analogous to those of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Atrial flutter, a more organized rhythm than atrial fibrillation, generally terminates with lower electrical doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of arrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An additional factor in the likelihood of a successful cardioversion or defibrillation, for both ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, is the amount of time an arrhythmia has been present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In ventricular fibrillation the duration of the arrhythmia is a determinant of the degree of organization of the electrical impulse. Even when using a biphasic waveform, the effectiveness of defibrillation is reduced when the arrhythmia is of longer duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The more recent the onset of ventricular fibrillation, the coarser are the fibrillatory waves and the greater the success with defibrillation. As the arrhythmia persists (ie, more than 10 to 30 seconds), the fibrillatory waves become finer and the likelihood of successful termination decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>].<br/><br/>This relationship has also been demonstrated in a study of 22 patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Defibrillation was effective in 82 percent of patients when delivered after five seconds compared with 45 percent when delivered after 15 seconds. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In atrial fibrillation there is a similar relationship between duration of atrial fibrillation and the success of cardioversion, although longer time periods are usually involved. One study of 198 patients found that sinus rhythm was restored in 98 percent of patients when the duration of atrial fibrillation was less than 24 hours compared with a success rate of 62 percent when the duration was more than 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The overall success rate for sinus rhythm restoration is approximately 90 percent when atrial fibrillation is of less than one year's duration compared with 50 percent when atrial fibrillation has been present for more than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667739759\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of antiarrhythmic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiarrhythmic drugs can increase or decrease the defibrillation energy requirements for ventricular fibrillation and the cardioversion energy requirements for atrial fibrillation. In general, sodium channel blockers increase the energy required for defibrillation, while potassium channel blockers and catecholamines decrease the energy needed. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> increases defibrillation energy requirements, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a> decrease the energy needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Epinephrine's effect on cycle length, synchronization, and dispersion of repolarization of fibrillatory waves may be the mechanisms by which it facilitates defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. These observations are relevant to external defibrillation success in the setting of a cardiac arrest, the ability to successfully defibrillate a patient with an implantable defibrillator during defibrillation threshold testing, and the use of ibutilide to facilitate restoration of sinus rhythm in patients undergoing elective cardioversion for atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6508517\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with an underlying cardiac implantable electronic device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an underlying cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) such as a permanent pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator require special attention to electrode placement.

Cardioversion is the delivery of energy that is synchronized to the QRS complex, while defibrillation is the non-synchronized delivery of a shock during the cardiac cycle. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardioversion terminates arrhythmias by delivering a synchronized shock that depolarizes the tissue involved in a reentrant circuit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52134 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82249 \">figure 3</a>). By depolarizing all excitable tissue of the circuit and making the tissue refractory, the circuit is no longer able to propagate or sustain reentry.

Most investigators agree that defibrillation occurs when a certain amount of current density reaches the myocardium. However, it is unclear what amount of current density is needed and what energy setting is necessary to achieve a homogeneous current density.
