The methodology, indications, and contraindications of stress testing, including exercise testing protocols, the endpoints of exercise testing, the electrocardiographic manifestations of exercise-induced ischemia, the role of stress testing for the diagnosis of stable CHD, for the estimation of prognosis in patients who have had a recent acute coronary syndrome, and in the evaluation of patients with a suspected acute coronary syndrome are discussed separately.

Exercise capacity or workload is one of the most important determinants of prognosis and, in some studies of exercise testing, has been the strongest predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events, particularly in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Among patients who undergo exercise stress, a number of variables, either alone or in combination, are associated with an increased risk of an adverse outcome in patients with CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2,5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-12</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor exercise capacity </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise-induced angina, particularly that which is exercise-limiting or occurs at a low workload</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormally low peak systolic blood pressure (&lt;130 mmHg) or a fall in systolic blood pressure below baseline during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronotropic incompetence (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Heart rate response to exercise'</a> below)</p><p/><p>There are also a number of ECG findings during exercise that are important.

Independent of past history, patients with poor exercise capacity are at increased cardiovascular risk, while those with excellent exercise capacity (a measure of fitness) are at reduced risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The importance of exercise capacity was illustrated in a report of 6213 consecutive men referred for exercise testing who were then followed for a mean of 6.2 years: 59 percent had an abnormal exercise test <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of cardiovascular disease, while 41 percent had a normal exercise test and no history of cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After adjustment for age, peak exercise capacity, measured in metabolic equivalents (METs), was the strongest predictor of mortality among men with and without cardiovascular disease. One MET is defined as 3.5 mL O2 <span class=\"nowrap\">uptake/kg</span> per minute, which is the resting oxygen uptake in a sitting position. For each 1 MET increase in exercise capacity, there was a 12 percent improvement in survival. The achieved exercise capacity and workload have also been shown to be predictive in older adult populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Exercise capacity, which is a measure of fitness, also has prognostic value in the general population. Individuals with poor exercise capacity are at increased cardiovascular risk, while those with excellent exercise capacity are at reduced risk. The relationship between fitness and long-term outcomes in asymptomatic individuals is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise and fitness in the prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Relation to fitness'</a>.)</p><p>A history of dyspnea (&quot;do you experience shortness of breath?&quot;) has been an adverse predictor in most but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Such a relationship was demonstrated in a review of almost 18,000 patients free of known cardiomyopathy or valvular disease who underwent rest and stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At 2.7 year follow-up, the 6 percent of patients with a history of dyspnea but not chest pain had, after multivariable analysis, significant increases in cardiac and all-cause mortality compared with all other subgroups, including those with typical angina and those with or without stress-induced ischemia. Among the patients with dyspnea, the prognosis varied with the rMPI findings as cardiac mortality ranged from 4.2 percent with a normal rMPI to 9.5 percent with a mild defect to 17.0 to 21.4 percent with moderate to severe defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403208739\"><span class=\"h2\">Exertional hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exertional hypotension, defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure below that measured standing at rest, is a fairly rare occurrence during exercise testing, but when present is often indicative of severe heart failure or multivessel coronary disease (including severe left main coronary stenosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In patients with exercise-induced ischemia or prior myocardial infarction, exertional hypotension is associated with an increased risk for new cardiac events. Other causes of exercise-induced hypotension include fixed cardiac output as seen with stenotic valvular heart disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, volume depletion, anemia, or certain drugs such as vasodilators. The exercise test should stop when exertional hypotension is detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403208759\"><span class=\"h2\">Exertional hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients develop exercise-induced hypertension, defined as a peak systolic blood pressure &ge;210 mmHg in men and &ge;190 mmHg in women. The following observations have been made regarding the prognostic significance of exercise-induced hypertension:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonhypertensive individuals with exaggerated blood pressure (BP) responses during Bruce or ergonomic stress protocols, compared with those without, are more likely to develop hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hypertensive response during exercise, particularly at peak exercise, is not associated with increased mortality when baseline BP is taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hypertensive response during submaximal exercise may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death in nonhypertensive individuals. In a study of 6578 asymptomatic individuals from the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study (74 percent without hypertension at baseline) who underwent submaximal Bruce treadmill tests and were followed for 20 years, exercise BP was not significantly associated with cardiovascular death after adjustment for rest BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, among individuals with baseline BP <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/90</span> mmHg, Bruce stage 2 BP <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;180/90</span> mmHg was associated with a significant increase in risk of cardiovascular death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A delayed decline in BP during recovery may be an adverse prognostic finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Upsloping ST depression may increase sensitivity at the price of reduced specificity and is not recommended as a criterion by the guidelines.

The positive predictive value of ST depression occurring during recovery for significant angiographic disease is not significantly different from that occurring during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The prognostic significance also may be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart rate response to exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An impaired heart rate (HR) response to exercise, known as chronotropic incompetence, is generally defined as failure to achieve 85 percent of the age-predicted maximum heart rate in the absence of medications known to slow or blunt the heart rate response to exercise (ie, beta blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers). While there are some conflicting data, chronotropic incompetence is generally thought to be predictive of all-cause mortality and CHD risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26-28</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort of 2953 patients referred for exercise ECG testing with myocardial perfusion imaging, 11 percent failed to achieve at least 85 percent of the age-predicted maximal heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At a mean follow-up of two years, chronotropic incompetence was associated with a significant increase in mortality (absolute increase 4 percent, adjusted relative risk 1.84) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70339\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70339 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a report of 3221 patients undergoing treadmill exercise echocardiography in which 495 patients (15 percent) failed to achieve at least 85 percent of the age-predicted maximal heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

As opposed to the studies of symptomatic patients described above, this study enrolled healthy asymptomatic women expected to have a lower event rate, which may have limited the ability of the study to detect a significant difference in mortality.

(See <a href=\"#H403209858\" class=\"local\">'Normal rMPI'</a> above.)</p><p>The combined utility of the Duke treadmill score and exercise echocardiography was illustrated in a study of 5375 patients with known or suspected CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 5.5 years, the following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with a low-risk Duke treadmill score, the yearly mortality in those with a normal rest echo study or evidence of disease in a single or multivessel territory was 0.7, 1.8, and 3 percent, respectively. However, although multivessel territory disease on echocardiography was associated with increased risk, it was present in only 1.4 percent of patients with a low risk Duke treadmill score.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with a moderate-risk Duke treadmill score, the yearly mortality in the three echocardiographic groups was 2.4, 3.7, and 7 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with a high-risk Duke treadmill score, the yearly mortality in the three echocardiographic groups was 4.6, 5, and 12 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with a normal echocardiographic study, the yearly mortality was 1 percent overall, and 0.7, 2.4, and 4.6 percent, respectively, in patients with a low-, moderate-, and high-risk Duke treadmill score.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER RISK SCORES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other treadmill scores have also been devised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5,105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,105,106</a>]. One model used exercise testing data from 4083 patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry who were treated medically and followed prospectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The presence of significant (&ge;1 mm) exercise-induced ST depression, the stage of exercise completed, and the extent of left ventricular dysfunction were important determinants of one-year mortality and of the likelihood of three-vessel or left main disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Flat or downsloping ST depression'</a> above.)</p><p>The Cleveland Clinic nomogram-illustrated model was developed from the results of electrocardiogram (ECG) exercise testing in 30,000 patients referred for suspected coronary heart disease, all of whom had normal baseline ECGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. It was validated in a separate group of over 5000 patients. The Cleveland Clinic model was better able to predict all-cause mortality over three years than the Duke score. However, the Cleveland Clinic model is more difficult to use due to the inclusion of multiple clinical variables such as age, sex, and presence of risk factors, as well as more exercise variables.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress testing provides important prognostic information in all patients undergoing stress testing. (See <a href=\"#H2949813\" class=\"local\">'Indications for stress testing for prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test#H458218799\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test&quot;, section on 'Indications for stress testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing is a preferred component of stress testing in most patients. Exercise capacity or workload is one of the most important determinants of prognosis, and in some studies of exercise testing, has been the strongest predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events. (See <a href=\"#H403208476\" class=\"local\">'Exercise capacity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exertional hypotension, defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure below that measured standing at rest, is a fairly rare occurrence during exercise testing, but when present is often indicative of severe heart failure or multivessel coronary disease. (See <a href=\"#H403208739\" class=\"local\">'Exertional hypotension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST segment depression during exercise testing is more commonly used for purposes of diagnosing coronary heart disease (CHD), but exercise-induced ST depression during exercise or recovery also has prognostic significance. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Flat or downsloping ST depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress myocardial imaging using either radionuclide perfusion or echocardiography provides incremental prognostic information over clinical characteristics and exercise testing results. (See <a href=\"#H403209758\" class=\"local\">'Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H403211812\" class=\"local\">'Stress echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Duke treadmill score, which uses three exercise parameters (exercise time, maximum ST segment deviation, and presence of angina), has been shown in a variety of patient populations to be useful for stratifying patients into low-, moderate-, or high-risk categories for future cardiovascular events.
