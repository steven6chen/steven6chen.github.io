The hypermetabolic response in burn patients is characterized by hyperdynamic circulatory, physiologic, catabolic, and immune system responses. Early recognition and treatment improves clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>Attenuation of the hypermetabolic response is accomplished by altering the physiologic and biochemical environment of the burn patient with early burn wound excision, grafting, and pharmacologic treatments. Nonpharmacologic therapies, such as providing specific nutrients and growth factors as well as activities and exercise, are also emerging as essential components of the management of burn patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The metabolic changes that occur following moderate-to-severe burns and the attenuation of the hypermetabolic response are reviewed here. The general care of the burn patient, including burn wound care and nutritional support, is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of the severely burned patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nutritional support for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERMETABOLIC RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypermetabolic response to injury is characterized by increased blood pressure and heart rate, peripheral insulin resistance, and increased protein and lipid catabolism, which lead to increased resting energy expenditure, increased body temperature, total body protein loss, muscle wasting, and stimulated synthesis of acute-phase proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/1-3,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5-9</a>]. These responses occur in all trauma, surgical, or critically ill patients, but the magnitude with which they occur and their duration are particularly severe and sustained for burn patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The cause of this complex response is not well understood. A marked and sustained increase in the secretion of catecholamines, glucocorticoids, glucagon, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> initiates the cascade of events leading to an acute hypermetabolic response with its ensuing catabolic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/7,10-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10-17</a>]. Interleukins 1 and 6, platelet-activating factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), endotoxin, neutrophil-adherence complexes, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and coagulation and complement cascades have been implicated in regulating this response to burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Once these cascades are initiated, their mediators and byproducts appear to perpetuate the persistent and increased metabolic rate associated with altered glucose metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Perturbations in the innate immune response to the burn injury are caused by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs bind to toll-like receptors to initiate an immunosuppressive state. Collectively, burns lead to an increased risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3380880629\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2546480057\"><span class=\"h3\">Phases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two distinct phases of metabolic regulation are described following injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ebb phase &ndash; The changes associated with the &quot;ebb phase&quot; occur within the first 48 hours of a burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Sustained hypermetabolic alterations include persistent elevations of the stress mediators (24-hour urine cortisol levels, serum cytokines, catecholamines, and basal energy requirements). Impaired glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity can persist for up to three years after severe burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnitude</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolic rate increases proportionally with burn size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A 15 to 20 percent total body surface area (TBSA) burn injury initiates a catabolic response, including impaired immunity and accentuating fluid shifts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Adults with a 20 percent TBSA burn injury develop a metabolic rate between 118 to 210 percent of that predicted by Harris-Benedict equations for basal metabolic rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients with burns greater than 40 percent TBSA almost always experience hypermetabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A further increase in hypermetabolism occurs in patients with burns of 50 to 60 percent TBSA, after which there is minimal further increase in hypermetabolic rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In a prospective longitudinal study in which resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry, stable isotope study, and body composition, children with burns greater than 40 percent TBSA developed a metabolic rate of 180 percent of the basal metabolic rate (BMR) during the acute admission, which persisted at an elevated rate of 150 percent of BMR following complete wound closure and was maintained at 110 percent of BMR at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>].

Both populations will go into a hyperdynamic state of tachycardia with increased cardiac output. </p><p>Depending upon the comorbidities of the adults, the patient may experience atrial fibrillation or any other rhythm that they are prone to experiencing. However, compared with children, the magnitude of hemodynamic changes in adults may not be as profound due to coexisting comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. For children, heart rates can exceed 180 percent of predicted values for age-matched children, and cardiac outputs can exceed 150 percent; both can remain elevated for up to two years after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered glucose metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under normal circumstances, a postprandial increase in blood glucose concentration stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Insulin mediates peripheral glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, thereby maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. Glucose metabolism in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin action&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In critical illness, metabolic alterations can significantly change energy substrate metabolism. In order to provide glucose, release of stress mediators opposes the anabolic actions of insulin. By enhancing adipose tissue lipolysis and skeletal muscle proteolysis, stress mediators (ie, counterregulatory hormones) increase gluconeogenic substrates, including glycerol, alanine, and lactate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68962\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68962 \">figure 1</a>), thus augmenting hepatic glucose production in burned patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>].</p><p>Hyperglycemia fails to suppress hepatic glucose release during this time, and the suppressive effect of insulin on hepatic glucose release is attenuated, significantly contributing to persistent hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/31,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,42,43</a>]. Catecholamine-mediated enhancement of hepatic glycogenolysis as well as direct sympathetic stimulation of glycogen breakdown further aggravate the hyperglycemia in response to stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Catecholamines also impair glucose disposal via alterations of the insulin-signaling pathway and GLUT4 translocation in muscle and adipose tissue, resulting in peripheral insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/38,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,44</a>]. </p><p>Insulin resistance in severely burned patients begins as early as three days postinjury, predominantly in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and lasts up three years postinjury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It is primarily mediated by the persistent elevation in catecholamines and cortisol levels, which lead to increased endogenous glucose production, in conjunction with the impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered protein and lipid metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in metabolic pathways and proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), contribute to lean-muscle protein breakdown, both during the acute and convalescent phases in response to burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-an-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: An overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to starvation, in which lipolysis and ketosis provide energy and protect muscle reserves, a moderate-to-severe burn considerably reduces the ability of the body to use lipids as an energy source. Skeletal muscle becomes the major source of substrate for glucose production, which leads to marked wasting of lean body mass (LBM) within days after burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/2,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,48</a>] and which persists for at least nine months post-burn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/7,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,49</a>]. Since skeletal muscle is responsible for 70 to 80 percent of whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, decreases in muscle mass may significantly contribute to this persistent insulin resistance post-burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin resistance: Definition and clinical spectrum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interestingly, the observed white adipose tissue (WAT) browning after burn&nbsp;injury appears to be a culprit, if not the main facilitator, of cachexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The sustained catecholamine surge in burns initiates WAT browning and the cascade of events leading to the hypermetabolic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], indicating that&nbsp;WAT browning may be detrimental for burn patients.&nbsp;Despite these findings, it remains to be determined if the&nbsp;attenuation of WAT browning is sufficient to overcome the impaired muscle and liver metabolic processes that have already occurred in the hypermetabolic response to the injury. </p><p>A 10 to 15 percent loss in LBM is associated with a significant increase in infection rates and marked delays in wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The resultant muscle weakness further prolongs mechanical ventilatory utilization, inhibits sufficient cough reflexes, and delays mobilization in protein-malnourished patients, thus contributing to mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Persistent protein catabolism may also account for growth and developmental delay frequently observed in pediatric patients with burns greater than 40 percent TBSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The profound wasting of lean body mass is further exacerbated by immobility. The classic teaching for critically ill burn patients was prolonged bed rest and immobility; however, this increases the risk for hypertrophic ossification, contractures, muscle wasting and weakness, neuropathies, pressure necrosis and pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, prolonged psychological disturbances, longer lengths of stay, and increased ventilator days. Current evidence demonstrates the safety and efficacy of early mobility protocols to shift this paradigm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].

A number of different strategies are used to alter the physiologic and biochemical environment.</p><p>The hypermetabolic response can be attenuated using nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic modalities. Nonpharmacologic modalities include early wound excision and closure, nutritional support, environmental support, exercise, and other adjunctive measures. </p><p>Specific pharmacotherapies that can attenuate the hypermetabolic response include pain relievers, anabolic hormones, anabolic steroids, catecholamine antagonists, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human growth hormone</a>, if needed, for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some pharmacotherapies are more effective in the acute rather than chronic phase of the burn injury. The acute phase is defined as the period immediately following the resuscitation phase, when the patient is hemodynamically stable, capillary permeability is restored, and diuresis has begun. It generally starts 48 to 72 hours post-burn injury. The chronic or rehabilitation phase begins when wounds are healed.</p><p>For adults and children, we recommend early burn excision and grafting, aggressive pain control using opioids acutely, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxandrolone</a> in both the acute and chronic phases of burn injury, insulin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> to maintain blood glucose levels between 110 and 150.

Wound closure alone, however, does not eliminate the hypermetabolic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis of six randomized trials showed a significant reduction in mortality with early excision and grafting in burn patients without inhalation injury (risk ratio [RR] 0.36, 95 percent CI 0.20-0.65) compared with conservative treatment of dressing changes and delayed skin grafts following eschar separation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter for the early excision group (standardized mean difference [SMD] 8.89), but the requirement for blood transfusions was significantly higher (SMD 1.65). There was no difference in duration of sepsis, wound healing time, and skin graft take between the two groups.</p><p>While burn wound closure within the first five days is optimal, it is not always possible. A retrospective study of 143 burn patients showed that a delayed primary wound closure (days 6 to 12) had a similar advantage of early wound closure in reducing risk of septicemia, mortality, morbidity, hospital stay, and cost of treatment in comparison with 449 patients treated with delayed closure, a practice that allowed wounds to granulate prior to skin grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Early excision and skin grafting is also associated with decreased severity of hypertrophic scarring, joint contractures, and stiffness and promotes faster rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].
