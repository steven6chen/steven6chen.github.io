They function both to prevent abrupt closure of the stented artery soon after the procedure as well as to lower the need for repeat revascularization compared to balloon angioplasty alone (formerly referred to as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty).</p><p>Stent thrombosis is an uncommon but serious complication of PCI with stenting. Most patients present with an acute coronary syndrome, usually with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram. Its cause is total or subtotal thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery by thrombus that originates in or close to an intracoronary stent. This finding is seen at the time of coronary angiography and it is necessary in most cases to secure the diagnosis. Death and myocardial infarction are not infrequent complications of stent thrombosis.</p><p>This topic will discuss the presentation and management of and outcomes after acute coronary artery stent thrombosis. Issues related to its incidence, timing, risk factors, and prevention are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.) In a report from the United States CathPCI Registry, among almost 7100 cases of stent thrombosis identified during a 16-month period, approximately 60 percent presented with STEMI, 23 percent with NSTEMI, and 17 percent with unstable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with early stent thrombosis (&lt;1 month after stent placement) are somewhat more likely to develop cardiogenic shock than those with late (1 to 12 months) or very late (&gt;12 months) stent thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The culprit lesion is more common in the left anterior descending artery (48 percent) in patients with early and late stent thrombosis, whereas the right coronary artery (38 percent) is more commonly involved in cases of very late stent thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Stent thrombosis should be considered in any patient who presents with an ACS after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting, particularly within the past year. In the CathPCI Registry, 1.8 percent of all PCI for ACS were attributable to stent thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a 2012 report from two hospitals in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, nearly 11 percent of all STEMI was attributable to definite stent thrombosis according to the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>While the possibility of stent thrombosis should be considered in any patient who presents with ACS after stent placement, there is no information from the history, physical examination, or electrocardiogram (ECG) that can be used to clearly discriminate between stent thrombosis and ACS due to ischemia from a lesion(s) not related to prior stent placement. In the presence of ST-elevation or other changes suggestive of target (stented) vessel ischemia, the suspicion for stent thrombosis should be higher. Such an event would be classified as probable stent thrombosis by the ARC criteria unless angiography confirms another culprit. We accept the ARC criteria for the diagnosis of stent thrombosis; these criteria include categories of definite, probable, and possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients who have unexplained death after stent placement for which stent thrombosis is a reasonable cause are categorized as having either probable or possible stent thrombosis.

Definite stent thrombosis may also be determined by pathologic confirmation of stent thrombosis at the time of an autopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients#H406428135\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;, section on 'Duration'</a>.) </p><p>While the (incidental) finding of thrombus within a stent in a patient without clinical findings is possible, this is likely infrequent.

The approach to the management of patients with unstable angina or acute MI is discussed elsewhere.

However, as outcomes in these patients appear to be worse than in individuals with ACS due to plaque rupture in a native coronary artery, it is critically important that the time to reperfusion be as short as possible. (See <a href=\"#H1043309842\" class=\"local\">'Compared to de novo coronary thrombosis'</a> below.) While a non-urgent invasive or a conservative strategy may be reasonable for some patients with unstable angina or non-ST elevation MI who have not had prior stenting,&nbsp;urgent coronary angiography should be considered for most patients in whom the diagnosis of stent thrombosis has been considered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128708648\"><span class=\"h2\">Periprocedural considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recanalization of the occluded artery is possible in over 95 percent of cases. Manual thrombus aspiration can be used in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and, in one study, was associated with greater epicardial and microvascular myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similar to patients with STEMI due to de novo thrombosis, we perform thrombectomy in most cases of stent thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suboptimal-reperfusion-after-primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suboptimal reperfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Thrombectomy'</a>.)</p><p>In some cases, contributing factors such as suboptimal stent apposition or prior placement of an undersized stent are present. We perform intravascular ultrasound in most cases of stent thrombosis and use this information for subsequent stent sizing and to confirm complete stent apposition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Some experts feel that new stent implantation should be avoided unless there is a clear indication such as a flow-limiting dissection. However, in many cases, we repeat stent placement unless thrombus aspiration and balloon angioplasty yield an optimal result. We generally guide the decision making about the type of stent placement (bare metal versus drug-eluting) in a manner similar to patients with de novo stenting, with drug-eluting stents preferred if the patient is able to comply with the recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients#H1840123222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>The periprocedural antithrombotic approach, including the use of parenteral antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, does not differ from that recommended for patients with acute STEMI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticoagulant-therapy-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticoagulant therapy in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet agents in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128708655\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term antiplatelet therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor compliance with the recommendation for DAPT may be the primary cause of development of stent thrombosis.

In addition, resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> may be an important contributing factor in many cases. The optimal approach to antiplatelet therapy after stent thrombosis in patients who demonstrate clopidogrel nonresponse on platelet testing, or a genetic predisposition to it, is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clopidogrel resistance and clopidogrel treatment failure&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>In patients who present with stent thrombosis while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, it is likely the risk of recurrent stent thrombosis is increased. While no trials of alternate antiplatelet regimens, such as switching to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> or higher-dose clopidogrel, have been performed in these patients, we believe that the benefit from the use of more potent antiplatelet therapy outweighs the increase in risk of bleeding in most patients. Therefore, we suggest discharging the patient on prasugrel 10 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. The minimum duration of DAPT should be one year, with longer courses for patients who are tolerating such therapy. </p><p>Similarly, for patients who present with stent thrombosis after completing the recommended duration of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, the optimal preventative antiplatelet strategy is unknown. We suggest initiating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> 10 mg daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> 90 mg twice daily rather than restarting clopidogrel and continuing DAPT for a minimum of one year or longer in patients tolerating this regimen. However, in patients who will not receive either prasugrel or ticagrelor, clopidogrel 75 mg daily (in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) should be restarted.</p><p>In patients who have sustained stent thrombosis, the optimal duration of DAPT is unknown.

IPST is not included in the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definitions and thus its presentation and management are not evaluated uniformly in studies of stent thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors#H176751508\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Intraprocedural stent thrombosis'</a>.)</p><p>In a study of over 10,000 individuals who underwent PCI with stenting, patients with IPST had a higher rate of composite ischemia (death, MI, ischemia-driven revascularization, or new-onset out-of-laboratory stent thrombosis) at 48 hours and 30 days compared to those without IPST (29.2 versus 4.5 and 31.5 versus 5.7 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The finding of a significantly higher rate of ARC definite or probable stent thrombosis at 30 days has been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most cases were in the setting of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome or ST elevation myocardial infarction. The impact of thrombus burden and the no-reflow phenomenon may be important contributors. While clearly distinguished from classic stent thrombosis after a successful procedure, the known adverse consequences of procedural complications remain important and ongoing studies are needed to assess methods for improved procedural success in these high-risk patients. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1043308826\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stent thrombosis is an uncommon but serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting. Most patients present with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), usually with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram. Its cause is total or subtotal thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery by thrombus that originates in or close to an intracoronary stent. This finding is seen at the time of coronary angiography and it is necessary, in most cases, to secure the diagnosis. Death and myocardial infarction are not infrequent complications of stent thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H1043309813\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the acute management of patients with stent thrombosis is similar to that for other patients with an ACS. Important points include considering the diagnosis in any patient ACS with prior stent placement and a rapid attempt to restore vessel patency. (See <a href=\"#H1128708641\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients diagnosed with stent thrombosis while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, we suggest switching the patient to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> 10 mg daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> 90 mg twice daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

The ultimate duration of DAPT will require continual assessment of the benefits and risks (in particular, bleeding risk). </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Cutlip DE, Windecker S, Mehran R, et al.
