Beh&ccedil;et syndrome may have been described by Hippocrates, but it was brought to the attention of the modern medical community by Hulusi Beh&ccedil;et in 1937 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Most clinical manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome are believed to be due to vasculitis. Among the systemic vasculitides, Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is remarkable for its ability to involve blood vessels of all sizes (small, medium, and large) on both the arterial and venous sides of the circulation.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome are reviewed here. The pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-behcet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-behcet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H591878\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is more common (and often more severe) along the ancient silk road, which extends from eastern Asia to the Mediterranean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. It is most common in Turkey (80 to 370 cases per 100,000) while the prevalence ranges from 13.5 to 35 per 100,000 in Japan, Korea, China, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By comparison, the prevalence ranges from 1 per 15,000 to 1 per 500,000 in North American (Olmsted County, Minnesota) and Northern European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The prevalence is similar in men and women in the areas where it is more common, but women are affected more commonly in reports from the United States and northern Europe. It typically affects young adults 20 to 40 years of age but is infrequently also seen in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The disease appears to be more severe in young, male patients from Middle- or Far-Eastern Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. Most cases of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome are sporadic, although families with multiple affected members, which is known as familial clustering, have been reported, and having a first-degree relative with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome does increase risk for the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Earlier onset of disease in successive generations, known as genetic anticipation, has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common clinical feature in patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is the presence of recurrent and usually painful mucocutaneous ulcers. Other clinical manifestations of this disorder are more variable among different patients and populations.</p><p>The severity is generally greater in men. The greatest morbidity and mortality occur with ocular disease (affecting up to two-thirds of patients), vascular disease (affecting up to one-third of patients), and central nervous system disease (affecting 10 to 20 percent of patients). Cutaneous and articular manifestations are common. Renal disease and peripheral nervous system involvement are rare compared with other vasculitides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Although there are limited data on children with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, clinical manifestations appear to generally be similar to those in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/7-9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,21</a>]. Among some populations, there may be differences in the frequencies or types of certain manifestations, including neurologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral ulcerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most, but not all, patients initially manifest recurrent oral aphthous ulcerations (also known as canker sores), which are grossly and histologically similar to common oral ulcers and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), but which tend to be more extensive and often multiple (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76223\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76223 \">picture 1</a>). The ulcers are painful and, in severe cases, may limit eating. They are rounded and range in size from a few millimeters to 2 cm. They have well-defined borders, have a white-yellow necrotic base, and may have surrounding erythema. Minor ulcers are defined as those less than 1 cm in diameter, and major ulcers are defined as those at least 1 cm in diameter. Major ulcers may scar. Outer portions of the lips are not involved.</p><p>Healing of oral ulcers is typically spontaneous within one to three weeks; with recurrent lesions, however, some patients will have ulcers present continuously. Oral ulcers are typically the first to come and last to leave in the course of the disease; they may become less common after about 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. They may be a less frequent manifestation in cigarette smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-lesions#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral lesions&quot;, section on 'Beh&ccedil;et syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Urogenital lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genital ulceration, the most specific lesion for Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, occurs in 75 percent or more of patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. The ulcers are similar in appearance to the oral aphthae and are usually painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Genital ulcers are most commonly found on the scrotum in men and the vulva in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81014\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81014 \">picture 2</a>). Recurrence is typically less frequent than with oral ulcerations. Scar formation is frequent for genital lesions. Scrotal scarring secondary to ulcers is rarely, if ever, seen in conditions other than Beh&ccedil;et syndrome.</p><p>Epididymitis, salpingitis, varicocele, and other genitourinary inflammatory conditions may also occur in patients with this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Urethritis is an unusual feature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous lesions also occur in over 75 percent of patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. The skin manifestations vary and may include acneiform lesions, papulo-vesiculo-pustular eruptions, pseudofolliculitis, nodules, erythema nodosum (septal panniculitis), superficial thrombophlebitis, pyoderma gangrenosum-type lesions, erythema multiforme-like lesions, and palpable purpura. Biopsy of erythema nodosum lesions reveals a septal panniculitis, with medium vessel vasculitis in up to half of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Acneiform lesions may be more common in those with associated arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. These lesions consist of papules and pustules that are indistinguishable from ordinary acne and share characteristic microbiologic flora with papulopustular lesions of acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Pustular skin lesions are often not sterile and may contain <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Prevotella</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Pathergy refers to an erythematous papular or pustular response to local skin injury. It is defined as a pustule-like lesion or papule that appears 48 hours after skin prick by a 20-gauge needle. Pathergy is less common in North American and North European patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome (10 to 20 percent) than in patients from more endemic areas (50 to 75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Dermographism is a response to light scratching of the skin that may be present in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A vascular pathergy-like response may be evident after vascular procedures, resulting in phlebitis or aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Vascular disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Nailfold capillary abnormalities, mainly enlarged capillaries, may also be observed in patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular disease occurs in 25 to 75 percent of patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, depending upon the population studied, and in most cases progresses to blindness if not treated. Ocular disease typically is less severe in North American populations, resulting in a lower incidence of vision loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Male patients are more likely to get eye disease, with about 75 to 80 percent developing involvement, and also have worse visual outcomes, even with treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uveitis is often the dominant feature of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. It is typically bilateral and episodic, often involves the entire uveal tract (pan uveitis), and may not resolve completely between episodes. Isolated anterior uveitis is rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypopyon is a severe anterior uveitis with purulent material in the anterior chamber that is characteristically seen in about 20 percent of patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. Many patients with hypopyon will demonstrate retinal vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64705%7ERHEUM%2F63242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64705 graphicRef63242 \">picture 3A-B</a>), vascular occlusion, and optic neuritis require systemic immunosuppressive treatment and may irreversibly impair vision and progress to blindness if untreated. Intermediate and posterior uveitis cannot be assessed reliably without the use of a slit lamp. Parenchymal central nervous system disease is more common in patients with optic neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other changes that can be seen include neovascularization, secondary cataracts, glaucoma, frosted branch angiitis, and, in approximately 3 percent of patients, conjunctival ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Neovascularization most commonly occurs due to inflammation, and treatment with immunosuppression, particularly with interferon, may be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Conjunctivitis, scleritis, episcleritis, and sicca syndrome are uncommon. Ocular signs may be helpful in making the diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, even in the absence of other clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective review of 880 Turkish patients with Beh&ccedil;et uveitis, 68 percent were male, and the mean age of onset was 28.5 years for men and 30 for women. Ocular disease was bilateral in 78.1 percent, and panuveitis was the most common finding. Risk of losing useful vision at 10 years was 30 percent for men and 17 percent for women, but prognosis was better in the 1990s than in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>A retrospective review of childhood-onset uveitis in 36 Beh&ccedil;et syndrome patients reported diagnostic and treatment findings similar to those seen in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic disease occurs in less than 10 percent of patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome in most series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. It is observed more frequently in men than women. Neurologic disease is classified as parenchymal or non-parenchymal:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parenchymal disease</strong> is subdivided into brainstem disease, multifocal (diffuse) disease (including brainstem, cerebral, or spinal cord disease), myelopathy, cerebral disease (including encephalopathy, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, seizures, dysphagia, and mental changes such as psychosis and cognitive dysfunction), and optic neuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Parenchymal disease may also be divided into acute and chronic progressive neuro-Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. A meta-analysis reviewed 184 acute and 114 chronic progressive cases, and fever and higher cerebrospinal fluid cell counts were found more commonly in acute disease, and sphincter disturbances, ataxia, confusion, brainstem atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebral changes on MRI were more common in chronic progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Focal parenchymal lesions and complications of vascular thrombosis are the most common abnormalities. Progressive personality change, psychiatric disorders, and dementia may develop. Unlike many other systemic vasculitic disorders, peripheral neuropathy is not a common feature of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, though it may develop in a subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Parenchymal disease may be due to lesions in the corticospinal tract, brainstem, periventricular white matter, spinal cord, and basal ganglia. Brainstem disease (which may extend to the midbrain, basal ganglia, and diencephalon) including focal lesions or atrophy with signs and symptoms including ophthalmoparesis, cranial neuropathy, and cerebellar or pyramidal dysfunction are more characteristic of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome than multiple sclerosis. Cerebral lesions are often multiple though may be single, are often subcortical, and are not particularly peri-ventricular, as in multiple sclerosis. Spinal cord lesions (myelitis) may occur in isolation, but are more common in patients with other central nervous system lesions. The clinical presentation of parenchymal disease is often subacute and manifestations may include headache, behavior changes, and deficits reflecting areas of parenchymal involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These central nervous system lesions are detectable with MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/46,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,54</a>]. Acute and subacute lesions are hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted images; hyperintense on T2-weighted, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted images; and commonly enhance with contrast. In the chronic phase, lesions may be smaller or resolve, atrophy may be present, nonspecific white matter lesions may be present, and lesions usually do not enhance. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may show increased protein and increased cells, and neutrophils may predominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Pathology reveals local perivenular lymphocytic cuffing, inflammatory cell infiltration, gliosis, necrosis, and neuronal loss. Although frank vasculitis is not always observed in parenchymal lesions, it is sometimes noted in larger cerebral vessels, including arteries or veins. Arteritis may lead to ischemic strokes, dissection, aneurysmal dilatation, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Non-parenchymal disease</strong> includes cerebral venous thrombosis, intracranial hypertension syndrome (pseudotumor cerebri), acute meningeal syndrome, and uncommonly stroke due to arterial thrombosis, dissection, or aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Central nervous system manifestations may result from arterial or venous thrombosis, including dural sinus thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Cerebral venous thrombosis may present with headache, papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, and an elevated CSF pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/12,23,46,56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23,46,56-59</a>]. An association has been observed between dural sinus thrombosis and peripheral deep venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Thrombosis of the cerebral arteries may also be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/46,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,56</a>]. One analysis of neurologic Beh&ccedil;et syndrome from Turkey, involving 26 children and 702 adults, found that dural venous sinus thrombosis was much more common in children than parenchymal neurologic involvement, although parenchymal disease was more frequent in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one large series, the clinical features and outcomes of 200 patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome and neurologic involvement were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. On average, a period of approximately five to six years elapsed between the onset of the earliest non-neurologic symptoms of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome and the appearance of neurologic symptoms or findings. Nevertheless, neurologic findings may also appear concurrently (7.5 percent) or precede non-neurologic features (3 percent). Twenty percent of those with neurologic findings were asymptomatic.

In particular, pulmonary artery aneurysm carries a high mortality of approximately 25 percent, and early recognition is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H357862568\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular disease in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is more common in men. A study of 2319 Turkish patients with Beh&ccedil;et found a prevalence of vascular disease of 14.3 percent and was most common in males. In this study, 53.3 percent suffered superficial venous thrombosis, 29.8 percent deep venous thrombosis, and 3.6 percent arterial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Another study of 796 Chinese patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome found vascular involvement in 12.8 percent of patients. The male-to-female ratio was approximately 4:1 and the mean age of onset was 29.5 years. Vascular disease was the presenting manifestation of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome in 25.5 percent of cases; 54.9 percent had arterial disease, 70.6 percent had venous disease, and 25.5 percent had both. Women were more likely to have arterial disease. Patients with vascular manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome were more likely to have cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H357862671\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial disease is most commonly a small vessel vasculitis, but medium and large vessel disease may also develop.</p><p>Large vessel vascular involvement occurs in approximately one-third of patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In these patients, perivascular and endovascular inflammation may lead to hemorrhage, stenosis, aneurysm formation, thrombus formation in both arteries and veins, and varices.

Oral ulcerations also tend to be more frequent and severe in patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. Genital ulcerations are more specific and less sensitive for the detection of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. Beh&ccedil;et syndrome should also be considered more strongly in patients with the aforementioned symptoms who live along the Silk Road from eastern Asia to the Mediterranean Sea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265677260\"><span class=\"h2\">Our diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are <strong>no</strong> pathognomonic laboratory tests in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome; as a result, the diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical findings. In the absence of other systemic diseases, we diagnose Beh&ccedil;et syndrome in patients with recurrent oral aphthae (at least three times in one year) plus two of the following clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent genital aphthae (aphthous ulceration or scarring).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye lesions (including anterior or posterior uveitis, cells in vitreous on slit lamp examination, or retinal vasculitis observed by an ophthalmologist).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin lesions (including erythema nodosum, pseudo-vasculitis, papulopustular lesions, or acneiform nodules consistent with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive pathergy test.

Most clinical manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome are believed to be due to vasculitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is more common (and often more severe) along the ancient silk road, which extends from eastern Asia to the Mediterranean; it is most common in Turkey, while the prevalence is much lower in North America and northern Europe. It typically affects young adults 20 to 40 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H591878\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The common clinical feature in patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is the presence of recurrent and usually painful mucocutaneous ulcers. Other clinical manifestations of this disorder are more variable among different patients and populations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Oral ulcerations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Urogenital lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The greatest morbidity and mortality occur with ocular disease (affecting up to two-thirds of patients), including uveitis and other changes; with vascular disease, including pulmonary artery aneurysms; and with central nervous system disease, including focal parenchymal lesions, complications of vascular thrombosis, and other abnormalities. Vasculitis in patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is remarkable for its ability to involve blood vessels of all sizes and to involve both arteries and veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68660\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68660 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Vascular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ocular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous manifestations are common, which included acne, folliculitis, and erythema nodosum lesions. Pathergy may be seen as an erythematous papular or pustular response to local skin injury. Arthritis may be present which is characteristically intermittent, inflammatory but nonerosive, asymmetric, and, usually, nondeforming; it often occurs during disease exacerbations and most commonly affects the medium and large joints. A variety of gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Arthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less common manifestations include renal disease and peripheral nervous system involvement. Cardiac and pulmonary disease may also be present. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Renal disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H265676823\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are <strong>no</strong> pathognomonic laboratory tests in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome; as a result, the diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical findings. In the absence of other systemic diseases, we diagnose Beh&ccedil;et syndrome in patients with recurrent oral aphthae (at least three times in one year) plus two of the following clinical features:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent genital aphthae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eye lesions (including anterior or posterior uveitis, cells in vitreous on slit lamp examination, or retinal vasculitis observed by an ophthalmologist)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin lesions (including erythema nodosum, pseudo-vasculitis, papulopustular lesions, or acneiform nodules consistent with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A positive pathergy test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This approach is consistent with the International Study Group (ISG) criteria published in 1990 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54762 \">table 2</a>).
