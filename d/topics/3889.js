It occurs in people who have pollen allergy, although not all patients have obvious hay fever or seasonal allergy symptoms. Patients typically report itching <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild swelling of the mouth and throat immediately following ingestion of certain uncooked fruits (including nuts) or raw vegetables. The symptoms result from contact urticaria in the oropharynx caused by pollen-related proteins in these foods. Only a small proportion of affected individuals experience systemic allergic reactions, although the disorder must be differentiated from more serious forms of food allergy.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of OAS and describes associations between specific pollens and foods. The pathogenesis, management, and prognosis of OAS are presented separately.

However, it has been imprecisely applied in the literature to describe oropharyngeal reactions due to a variety of nonplant foods as well as both oropharyngeal and systemic symptoms due to plant foods in subjects with pollen allergy. This imprecision has led to considerable confusion. In this review, OAS is used to describe reactions caused by pollen-related foods that are <strong>limited to the oropharynx</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1250209\"><span class=\"h3\">Pollen-food allergy syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;pollen-food allergy syndrome,&quot; &quot;pollen-food syndrome,&quot; and &quot;pollen-associated food allergy syndrome&quot; (abbreviated PFAS or PFS) are increasingly used instead of OAS, both to emphasize the pathogenesis of these reactions and to describe the full range of oropharyngeal and systemic symptoms that can occur in response to pollen-related foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In this review, PFS is the preferred term for the entire spectrum of reactions caused by pollen-related plant foods.</p><p>Nonplant foods, such as cow's milk, egg, or seafood, do not cause PFS.

Usually, patients develop allergic rhinitis to pollen first and then develop PFS following an increase in the severity of allergic rhinitis. A small study found that the prevalence of PFS increased with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, PFS is the first manifestation with no or minimal allergic rhinitis symptoms reported by the patient. The mechanisms underlying these variations in clinical presentation are unknown. It is our clinical experience that when PFS develops in a child, the number of foods that cause symptoms tends to increase over time. Some adults with pollinosis also progress to experiencing PFS to an increasing number of plant foods. In many patients, PFS tends to be a persistent condition that is lifelong, unless the patient undergoes immunotherapy for treatment of the underlying pollen allergy, and this is only successful in controlling symptoms of PFS in a subset of patients.

Allergy to grass pollens and weed pollens (commonly ragweed or mugwort) are less commonly associated with PFS. In a population of 936 unselected adults, for example, 24 percent were sensitized to pollen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Pollen-sensitized individuals were evaluated for PFS with clinician-supervised oral food challenges.

However, among patients with comparable serum levels of pollen-specific IgE antibodies, some patients react to one plant food, while others react to multiple foods. It is possible, although not proven, that both the affinity of the IgE antibodies as well as the recognition of the specific epitopes on pollen allergens affect the clinical expression of PFS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sensitization to multiple pollens</strong> &ndash; Individuals sensitized to multiple pollens are most likely to be affected by PFS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the study described previously, 52 percent of people allergic to three pollens reacted to related foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In an Italian study of children with allergy to grass pollen (mean age of eight years), PFS was reported in 20 percent of those allergic to grass alone and up to 46 percent of those sensitized to both grass and birch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Having symptomatic pollinosis (nasal, ocular, or respiratory symptoms of pollen allergy)</strong> &ndash; Patients with nasal, ocular, and respiratory symptoms of pollen allergy (pollinosis) are at greater risk for PFS, compared with patients who are sensitized to pollen but have no symptoms. In one large study of pollen-sensitized patients, the odds ratio of a clinical reaction to pollen-related fruits and vegetables was four times higher among those with symptoms of pollinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In Japan, Japanese cedar and plane tree pollens are associated with PFS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sensitization to birch pollen is very common in the United States, although birch trees are not particularly prevalent.

Patients usually tolerate the culprit food in various cooked forms. Cooking, baking, or even briefly microwaving raw fruits and vegetables is usually sufficient to alter the allergens that are responsible for PFS. Tree nuts and peanuts are an important exception to this generalization, as roasted nuts can cause PFS. Implications for management are discussed separately.

A few patients complain of nausea and abdominal discomfort, which may represent esophageal and gastric symptoms that develop before the allergen is fully degraded. Some birch-allergic individuals develop analogous contact urticaria on their hands after handling raw potato. These two presentations are better classified as local reactions because the involved tissues are directly contacting the undigested food. Ingestion of large quantities of the raw plant foods tends to be associated with more severe symptoms.</p><p>True systemic reactions involve tissues that do not come into direct contact with undigested food. Symptoms may include the entire range of IgE-mediated allergic manifestations, such as urticaria, angioedema, nasal congestion, sneezing, flushing, wheezing, cough, diarrhea, and hypotension.</p><p>In a review of several studies of patients with PFS, which included a total of 1361 subjects, the following was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>9 percent experienced associated symptoms outside of the gastrointestinal tract</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3 percent at some time experienced systemic symptoms without oral symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1.7 percent experienced anaphylactic shock</p><p/><p>Patients who react to plant foods but do not report allergic rhinitis in response to pollens are at higher risk for systemic reactions, because these patients may not be sensitized to pollen and may have an independent food allergy, rather than PFS. Such patients may be sensitized to more stable allergens, such as nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs). In one study, 82 percent of patients with birch-related fruit allergy without allergic rhinitis had systemic symptoms, while only 45 percent of those with both fruit allergy and allergic rhinitis had systemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Anaphylactic shock occurred in 36 percent of those without allergic rhinitis, versus 9 percent of those with allergic rhinitis. The high rate of systemic reactions in the subjects with allergic rhinitis in this preselected population was unusual and probably not representative of a general population of patients with PFS. A report of patients with severe hazelnut allergy without concomitant pollinosis documented IgE binding to heat-stable hazelnut proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

This is called latex-fruit or latex-food syndrome. An increasing number of plant foods, such as avocado, banana, kiwi, chestnut, peach, tomato, white potato, and bell pepper, have been associated with this syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60713\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60713 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>].

Sensitization to peach and related Rosaceae fruits without clinical symptoms is also common, and sensitization alone is not sufficient to diagnose clinical allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Peach allergy in Spain appears to be particularly prevalent and is associated with more systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/33,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,60</a>].

Both skin testing and in vitro testing in the diagnosis of PFS are complicated by the variable and unstable nature of the responsible allergens and the extensive cross-reactivity among them. Both false-negative and false-positive results are common in patients with PFS. Positive tests may result from the presence of cross-reactive panallergens in fruits and vegetables from the same family, as well as in plant foods and the related pollens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Prick-by-prick testing is performed by inserting the test device into the fruit, withdrawing it, and then immediately pricking the patient's cleaned skin. It is important to prick all edible parts of the food (eg, both the outer skin and the flesh of fruits) with the testing device, in order to recreate the allergen exposure that would result from eating these foods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Testing with fresh fruits and vegetables is sometimes confounded by natural variations in allergen levels due to differences among the various varieties (eg, cultivars), ripeness, or changes induced by storage.

Reactions are immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and caused by allergens in plant foods that are homologous to pollen allergens. PFS is a more general term that encompasses both oropharyngeal and systemic reactions due to these allergens. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PFS is believed to be the most common type of food allergy in adults and likely affects at least 5 percent of the population.

Individuals with nasal, ocular, and respiratory symptoms in response to pollen are at greater risk for PFS than pollen-sensitized subjects without clinical pollen allergy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PFS usually presents with pruritus and swelling of the mouth and throat during or just after ingestion of fresh, uncooked fruits and vegetables. Oropharyngeal symptoms usually resolve promptly when food is swallowed, and cooked forms of the culprit foods are generally tolerated because the responsible allergens are susceptible to gastric acid, digestive enzymes, and heat. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although uncommon, systemic symptoms and reactions to cooked foods are both possible in PFS. Fewer than 10 percent of patients with PFS experience systemic symptoms, although these may be severe.
