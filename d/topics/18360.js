Upper urinary tract infections (ie, acute pyelonephritis) may lead to renal scarring, hypertension, and end-stage renal dysfunction. Although children with pyelonephritis tend to present with fever, it can be difficult on clinical grounds to distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis, particularly in young children (those younger than two years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-older-than-one-month-and-young-children-acute-management-imaging-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Indications for hospitalization may include age &lt;2 months, clinical urosepsis, immunocompromised patient, vomiting or inability to tolerate oral medication, lack of outpatient follow-up, and failure to respond to outpatient therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Decision to hospitalize'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric antimicrobial therapy immediately after appropriate urine collection is warranted in children with suspected UTI and a positive urinalysis. This is particularly true for young children with fever (especially if &gt;39&deg;C [102.2&deg;F] or &gt;48 hours), ill appearance, costovertebral angle tenderness, known immune deficiency, or known urologic abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that empiric therapy for UTI in children include an antibiotic that provides adequate coverage for <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The agent of choice should be guided by local resistance patterns. Definitive therapy is based upon the results of urine culture and sensitivities. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest a cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefixime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefdinir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefdinir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftibuten-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftibuten</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cephalexin</a>) as the first-line oral agent in the treatment of UTI in children without genitourinary abnormalities (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Amoxicillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> should be added if enterococcal infection is suspected.

Renal bladder ultrasonography (RBUS) should be performed as soon as possible to evaluate the presence of renal abscess or surgically correctable anatomic abnormalities or obstruction.
