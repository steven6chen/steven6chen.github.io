Immunologic abnormalities, particularly the production of a number of antinuclear antibodies, are another prominent feature of the disease. Women are affected more frequently than men.</p><p>SLE has protean clinical manifestations that can affect virtually every organ, and can vary dramatically from patient to patient. The most common pattern is a mixture of constitutional complaints with skin, musculoskeletal, mild hematologic, and serologic involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70386\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70386 \">table 1</a>). However, some patients have predominately hematologic, renal, or central nervous system manifestations. The pattern that dominates during the first few years of illness tends to prevail throughout the disease course. The clinical course of SLE is highly variable among patients and may be characterized by periods of remissions and of chronic or acute relapses.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of SLE in adults are presented here. The diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of SLE in adults are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>). The clinical manifestations of SLE in children are also presented separately.

The disease course is marked by remissions and relapses and may vary from mild to severe.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of SLE are presented below. Most of these manifestations have been included as part of classification criteria for SLE, as a means of categorizing patients for study purposes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F86633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86633 \">table 2</a>). The criteria can be useful for helping clinicians recognize and document some of the key disease manifestations of SLE. The classification criteria are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults#H690922880\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;, section on 'Classification criteria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Constitutional symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and weight loss are present in most lupus patients at some point during the course of the disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue &ndash; Fatigue is the most common complaint, occurring in 80 to 100 percent of patients, and can sometimes be disabling. Its presence is not clearly correlated with other measures of disease activity, and is more frequently associated with depression, sleep disturbances, and concomitant fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Fever can be a manifestation of active disease, and is seen in over 50 percent of patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, in clinical practice, distinguishing fever associated with a lupus flare from other causes of fever such as infection, a drug reaction, or malignancy can be difficult. Clinically, there are no specific features that definitively distinguish fever due to SLE from fever due to other causes. However, the history may be helpful in determining the cause of the fever. As an example, fever in the setting of moderate or high doses of glucocorticoids should lead one to strongly suspect new infection, particularly if other signs are remitting. Fever that does not respond to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low to moderate doses of glucocorticoids should raise the suspicion of an infectious or drug-related etiology, since most fevers due to active SLE will remit with use of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, a low white blood cell (WBC) count in the setting of fever would be more consistent with lupus activity rather than infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serious infections are a major cause of morbidity among patients and should be considered in all immunocompromised SLE patients with fever. (See <a href=\"#H693022519\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myalgia &ndash; Myalgia is also common among patients with SLE, whereas severe muscle weakness or myositis is relatively uncommon. Myalgia and muscle weakness are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Muscle disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight change &ndash; Weight changes are frequent in patients with SLE and may be related to the disease or to its treatment. Weight loss often occurs prior to the diagnosis of SLE. Unintentional weight loss may be due to decreased appetite, side effects of medications (particularly diuretics and occasionally <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>), and gastrointestinal disease (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, abdominal pain, peptic ulcer disease, or pancreatitis) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>). Weight gain in SLE may be due to salt and water retention associated with hypoalbuminemia (eg, due to nephrotic syndrome or protein losing enteropathy) or alternatively, due to increased appetite associated with the use of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H331674036\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Protein-losing enteropathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthritis and arthralgias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthritis and arthralgias occur in over 90 percent of patients with SLE and are often one of the earliest manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Arthritis, with demonstrable inflammation, occurs in 65 to 70 percent of patients and tends to be migratory, polyarticular, and symmetrical. The arthritis is moderately painful, usually does not cause erosion, and rarely deforming (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78325%7ERHEUM%2F65248\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78325 graphicRef65248 \">picture 1A-B</a>). However, occasionally SLE patients also develop a deforming erosive arthritis which is similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

There is tremendous variability in the type of skin involvement in SLE. The most common lesion is a facial eruption that characterizes acute cutaneous lupus erythema (ACLE) (also known as &quot;the butterfly rash&quot;) that presents as erythema in a malar distribution over the cheeks and nose (but sparing the nasolabial folds), which appears after sun exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75781%7EDERM%2F55875\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75781 graphicRef55875 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Some patients may develop discoid lesions, which are more inflammatory and which have a tendency to scar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75833%7EDERM%2F64844\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75833 graphicRef64844 \">picture 3A-B</a>). Photosensitivity is also a common theme for skin lesions associated with SLE. The various cutaneous manifestations of SLE are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many patients develop oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nasal ulcers, which are usually painless, in contrast to herpetic chancre blisters. Nasal ulcers may lead to nasal septal perforation. Nonscarring alopecia is also observed in many SLE patients at some point during the course of their disease. Scarring alopecia can occur in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE).

The clinical spectrum of vasculitis in the setting of SLE is broad due to the potential for inflammatory involvement of vessels of all sizes. Small vessel involvement is the most common, often manifesting as cutaneous lesions; however, medium and large vessel involvement have also been observed. Other specific types of vasculitic involvement in SLE include mesenteric vasculitis, hepatic vasculitis, pancreatic vasculitis, coronary vasculitis, pulmonary vasculitis, retinal vasculitis as well as vasculitis of the peripheral or central nervous system. A few cases of aortitis, similar to that seen in Takayasu arteritis, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

As an example, a large series including 670 SLE patients identified vasculitis among 11 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Cutaneous lesions were the main clinical presentation of vasculitis, present in 89 percent of patients. The remaining 11 percent of patients with vasculitis had visceral involvement (eg, peripheral nerves, lung, pancreas, and kidney).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1192579153\"><span class=\"h3\">Thromboembolic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thromboembolic disease can complicate SLE, particularly in the context of antiphospholipid antibodies. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, thromboembolic disease can affect both the venous and arterial circulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As an example, in a large observational cohort of 554 newly diagnosed SLE patients followed for a median of 6.3 years, an arterial thrombotic event (ATE) occurred in 11 percent, a venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurred in 5 percent, and the estimated 10-year risks were 10 percent for VTE, 26 percent for ATE, and 33 percent for any thrombotic event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Antimalarials may be protective for the development of thromboembolic disease in SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal involvement is clinically apparent in approximately 50 percent of SLE patients, and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, periodic screening for the presence of lupus nephritis with urinalyses, quantitation of proteinuria, and estimation of the glomerular filtration rate is an important component of the ongoing management of SLE patients. Several forms of glomerulonephritis can occur, and renal biopsy is useful to define the type and extent of renal involvement. The clinical presentation of lupus nephritis is highly variable ranging from asymptomatic hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria to nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with loss of renal function. Some patients with lupus nephritis also have hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in SLE patients, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients. The majority of gastrointestinal symptoms are caused by adverse medication reactions and viral or bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. SLE-related gastrointestinal abnormalities can involve almost any organ along the gastrointestinal tract and include esophagitis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, protein-losing enteropathy, lupus hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, mesenteric vasculitis or ischemia, and peritonitis. The gastrointestinal manifestations of SLE are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the course of their disease, many patients develop symptoms secondary to pulmonary involvement of SLE. Pulmonary manifestations of SLE include pleuritis (with or without effusion), pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, shrinking lung syndrome, and alveolar hemorrhage. Respiratory symptoms must also be distinguished from infection, particularly in patients on immunosuppressive therapy. The risk of thromboembolic involvement is increased in those with antiphospholipid antibodies or with lupus anticoagulant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac disease among patients with SLE is common and can involve the pericardium, myocardium, valves, conduction system, and coronary arteries. Pericarditis, with or without an effusion, is the most common cardiac manifestation of SLE occurring in approximately 25 percent of patents at some point during their disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Verrucous (Libman-Sacks) endocarditis is usually clinically silent, but it can produce valvular insufficiency and can serve as a source of emboli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79709\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79709 \">picture 5</a>).
