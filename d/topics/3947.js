In low- and middle-income countries, they are a significant source of rabies transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, there is an annual incidence of two to five million occurrences which account for about 1 percent of all visits to emergency departments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. More than one million victims of bites seek medical attention; medical costs for dog bites alone may be as much as USD $1 billion per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The vast majority of mammalian bites are inflicted by dogs (60 to 90 percent), with the remainder caused by cats (5 to 20 percent), rodents (2 to 3 percent), humans (2 to 3 percent), and rarely, other animals.</p><p>Approximately 10 percent of bite wounds presenting for medical attention require suturing and follow-up care, and 1 to 2 percent result in hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/4,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10-12</a>].

Extensive morbidity, including disability and cosmetic damage, can also result from infection.</p><p>Epidemiology differs among dog, cat, and human bites:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dog bites</strong> &ndash; Dog bites are frequently caused by animals known to the victim. This was demonstrated in a large observational study that described dog bite wounds sustained by children who were treated in an Austrian pediatric trauma center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The dog was familiar to the child in 82 percent of cases. German Shepherds were responsible for 34 percent of bites, although the breed comprised only 12 percent of the local dog population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In other studies, male dogs and certain breeds of dog (eg, German Shepherds, Pit Bull Terriers) are more commonly associated with bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/5,9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dog bites to the head and neck occur in 60 to 70 percent of attacks in children below the age of five years and in 50 percent of those 5 to 10 years old, presumably because of the proximity of the young child's head to the level of the mouth in a large dog and their uninhibited behavior around dogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the Austrian series, 50 percent of injuries were to the face, head, and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cat bites</strong> &ndash; Cats usually cause wounds with their teeth or claws. In contrast to dogs, which often bite males and children without overt provocation, females and adults are more commonly bitten by cats; 89 percent of these bites are provoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Human bites</strong> &ndash; Bites by humans occur in two basic categories: occlusive wounds (similar to dog or cat bites, with teeth closing over and breaking the skin) and clenched-fist or fight bites (in which the skin surface, usually of the hand and frequently overlying a joint, strikes a tooth resulting in damage to the skin and underlying structures). The latter are more common in males, while the former are more common in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>]. These wounds are less often deeply penetrating but can be associated with notable local soft tissue injury and hand fractures. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominant pathogens in animal bite wounds are the oral flora of the biting animal and human skin flora. Infection usually results from a mixture of organisms. Common pathogens (in order of prevalence) include <em>Pasteurella</em>, S<em>taphylococcus</em>, and S<em>treptococcus </em>species and anaerobic bacteria. <em>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</em>, a fastidious gram-negative rod, can cause bacteremia and fatal sepsis after animal bites, especially in asplenic patients, chronic alcohol abusers, or those with underlying hepatic disease. Cat bites can also transmit <em>Bartonella henselae</em>, the organism responsible for cat scratch disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pasteurella-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pasteurella infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cat scratch disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capnocytophaga\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Capnocytophaga&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogens involved in human bite wound infections usually reflect normal human mouth and skin flora. The types of organisms recovered differ from animal bites:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Pasteurella multocida </em>is a rare isolate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Eikenella corrodens</em>, a gram-negative anaerobe, is a common constituent of normal human mouth flora and is recovered from 7 to 29 percent of human bite wounds but rarely from animal bites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerobic gram-positive cocci (eg, Group A <em>Streptococcus</em>) and anaerobes are found more frequently in bites from humans than from other animals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical location and nature of the injury differs depending upon the animal inflicting the bite:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dog bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dog bites cause a range of injuries from minor wounds (eg, scratches, abrasions) to major complicated wounds (eg, deep open lacerations, deep puncture wounds, tissue avulsions and crush injuries) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56399\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56399 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>]. The jaws of large dogs can exert a strong force that may inflict serious injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Lethal injuries, although rare, usually involve the head and neck, or direct penetration of vital organs in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>The extremities, particularly the dominant hand, are the most frequent site of injury in older children or adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/5,6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cat bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-thirds of cat bites involve the upper extremities; cat scratches typically occur on the upper extremities or face. Deep puncture wounds are of particular concern because cats have long, slender, sharp teeth. When the hand is the target of such a puncture wound, bacteria can be inoculated below the periosteum or into a joint and result in osteomyelitis or septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>]. Because scratches and small puncture wounds may appear insignificant, victims may seek early medical attention less frequently than with dog bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Human bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human bites are the third most common after dog and cat bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. When a patient is bitten by another human, a semicircular or oval area of erythema or bruising is usually visible; the skin itself may or may not be intact.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pediatric wounds</strong> &ndash; In young children, human bites are typically located on the face, upper extremities, or trunk. They frequently occur as the result of aggressive play with another child who inflicts the bite. These wounds may not break the skin and are often trivial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, if a bite mark has a maxillary intercanine distance (distance between left and right canine measured from the outer edge of the tooth) greater than 2.5 cm, the bite probably came from an adult and should raise concerns about child abuse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69917\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69917 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H1593427205\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Inflicted bruises'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Self-inflicted bites may also occur from nail-biting and thumb-sucking but can also be associated with psychiatric illness or metabolic disease. Occasionally, paronychia in infants has been reported to result from a parent biting rather than cutting the child's nails.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clenched fist injury</strong> &ndash; Clenched fist injuries are not bites but are clinically similar to bite wounds because the skin is disrupted by teeth. They are typically sustained when a clenched fist strikes the teeth of another person. They occur most commonly among adolescents and adults. Skin breaks over the knuckles can lead to the introduction of both skin and oral flora into fascial layers of the hand with potential spread to the nearby joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The lacerations typically occur over the third and fourth metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joints of the dominant hand. Although they are usually quite small (up to 15 mm), they are highly prone to infection given the proximity of the skin over the knuckles to the joint capsule. Relaxation of the fist may carry organisms into the deep compartments and the deep tendon spaces of the hand. Thus, patients with such injuries are at risk for deep soft tissue infection, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hand-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hand infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many patients ignore these wounds until the onset of pain, swelling or purulent discharge; as a result, these injuries are often complicated by established infection at the time patients seek medical attention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;, section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other sites</strong> &ndash; Bites to the breasts and genitals may occur during sexual activity or sexual assault.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Infected wound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of bite wound infections may include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74167\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74167 \">picture 3</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purulent drainage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphangitis &#160;</p><p/><p>Complications include subcutaneous abscesses, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, tendonitis, and bacteremia.

Systemic signs of infection, such as fever and lymphadenopathy, are infrequent. Localized cellulitis caused by this organism can be subacute in onset, beginning 24 to 72 hours after the injury; systemic infection occurs in fewer than 20 percent of these cases, but may involve the bone, joints, blood, and meninges. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pasteurella-infections#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pasteurella infections&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>A delay in treatment from the time of bite injury is one of several factors that can affect the incidence of infection following dog or cat bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients who wait more than 24 hours after injury to seek medical attention have probably developed infection and are often seeking care for infectious signs or symptoms rather than evaluation of an uninfected wound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures are warranted prior to antibiotic therapy in patients with an infected bite wound <strong>and</strong> signs of systemic infection.

Wound cultures are <strong>not</strong> indicated in clinically uninfected bite wounds as results do not correlate with likelihood of infection or the pathogen that is present in patients with subsequent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29</a>].</p><p>If a bite wound appears to be infected, Gram stain and aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be obtained prior to the initiation of antibiotics. The laboratory requisition should note that an animal or human bite wound is the culture source. <em>Eikenella corrodens </em>(human bites) and <em>Pasteurella multocida</em> (dog and cat bites) are fastidious organisms and are often misidentified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs and ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep bite wounds near joints warrant AP and lateral plain radiographs to evaluate for disruption of bone or joints and evidence of foreign bodies, such as embedded teeth.</p><p>Plain radiographs are also indicated in markedly infected wounds to detect bony and soft tissue injury, subcutaneous gas, and changes associated with osteomyelitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68154\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68154 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p>Ultrasound may be helpful for identifying abscess formation as well as locating radiolucent foreign bodies in infected wounds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Head computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dog bites to the head occasionally penetrate the skull.

Debridement of devitalized tissue is important to remove any nidus for infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once anesthetized, the wound should be carefully explored to identify injury to underlying structures and the possible presence of a foreign body. Wounds over or near the metacarpophalangeal joints should be explored carefully in the anatomical <strong>and</strong> the clenched-fist position to assess for damage to the underlying tendon sheath, fascia, joint capsule, and metacarpal head.

A clinician with prior training and experience in laceration repair may perform primary wound closure of simple lacerations due to dog bites. By contrast, most cat or human bites are left open to heal by secondary intention. However, when cosmesis is paramount (eg, facial lacerations), the experienced clinician may choose to repair these wounds as well.</p><p>In addition to these indications for primary wound closure of open lacerations, we suggest that the laceration meets <strong>all</strong> of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically uninfected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 12 hours old (24 hours on the face)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Not</strong> located on the hand or foot</p><p/><p>In particular, wounds to the face are usually closed promptly because good cosmesis is especially important, and infection of these wounds is uncommon, perhaps due to the excellent blood supply to the face and scalp. Subcutaneous sutures should be used sparingly, if at all, because foreign material in a contaminated wound increases the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
