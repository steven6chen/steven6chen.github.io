They have been recovered from surface water, tap water, soil, domestic and wild animals, milk, and food products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. These organisms can also inhabit body surfaces or secretions without causing disease. Thus, occasional isolates of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) were largely considered contaminants or colonizers until the second half of this century. However, as tuberculosis declined and modern microbiological methods were developed, the importance of NTM in human disease became increasingly evident. </p><p>In broad terms, NTM cause four distinct clinical syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive pulmonary disease especially in older persons caused primarily by <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) and <em>Mycobacterium kansasii</em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial lymphadenitis, especially cervical lymphadenitis, in children caused mostly by MAC, <em>Mycobacterium scrofulaceum</em>, and, in northern Europe, <em>Mycobacterium malmoense</em> and <em>Mycobacterium haemophilum</em>; the most common cause in adults, however, is <em>M. tuberculosis</em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated disease in severely immunocompromised patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin and soft tissue infection usually as a consequence of direct inoculation</p><p/><p>The epidemiology of NTM will be reviewed here.

Less common human pathogens include the slowly growing species <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em>, <em>Mycobacterium xenopi</em>, <em>Mycobacterium simiae</em>, <em>M. malmoense</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium ulcerans</em>, and the rapidly growing species <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em>, <em>Mycobacterium fortuitum</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium chelonae</em>.</p><p>The precise frequency of disease due to the different species of NTM is unknown. Determining the incidence and prevalence of NTM lung disease is difficult because disease reporting is not mandatory in the United States nor in many other countries. Furthermore, many studies use &quot;isolation prevalence&quot; as a surrogate for disease prevalence, although the mere isolation of an NTM does not necessarily indicate disease. One study suggested that meeting the American Thoracic Society (ATS) microbiologic criteria for pulmonary disease correlated well (in 86 percent) with ATS clinical criteria for disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Based upon the available data, it appears that the burden of NTM disease has been increasing in the United States and other resource-rich settings. In a systematic review that included 22 studies that evaluated trends in the rate of NTM disease across the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Japan between 1946 and 2014, NTM disease incidence increased in 75 percent of regions evaluated, remained stable in 12.5 percent, and declined in 12.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, specifically, a study using mycobacterial culture data from electronic laboratory databases and billing codes from four health care delivery systems (southern California, Seattle, Denver, and Pennsylvania) estimated the average site-specific prevalence between 2004 and 2006 to range from 1.4 to 6.6 cases per 100,000 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Prevalence increased by 2.6 and 2.9 percent per year among women and men, respectively. In a separate study focusing on adults &ge;65 years that used billing codes to identify disease, the estimated prevalence of NTM lung disease increased from 20 to 47 cases per 100,000 individuals between 1997 and 2007, or 8.5 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similarly, in a study from Oregon, the incidence of NTM lung disease, as defined by the ATS microbiologic criteria, increased with age and overall rose 2.2 percent per year between 2007 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Most cases were MAC (86 percent) followed by <em>M. abscessus</em> or <em>M. chelonae</em> (6 percent). </p><p>Similar trends have been reported in other countries. In Ontario, Canada, prevalence of patients meeting ATS microbiologic criteria for NTM lung disease increased 10 percent per year from 2003 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a study of pulmonary NTM cases in Queensland, Australia, where NTM disease is a notifiable condition, the incidence of cases rose from 2.2 to 3.2 per 100,000 population between 1999 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to adults, the predominant NTM disease in children is cervical lymphadenitis due to MAC and <em>M. scrofulaceum</em> and cutaneous disease due to <em>M. marinum</em> and <em>M. ulcerans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Rare cases of disseminated disease have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>NTM strains are commonly isolated from sputum in patients with cystic fibrosis and may be clinically significant. In a study from 21 cystic fibrosis centers in the US, NTM were isolated from the sputum of 13 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Many of these host immune defects are associated especially with disseminated infection.

Epidemiologic studies from Sweden and Finland have suggested that childhood immunization with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is associated with a reduced risk of childhood cervical lymphadenitis due to NTM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM COMPLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The members of the <em>M. avium</em> complex (MAC) are ubiquitous, free-living organisms readily recovered from natural reservoirs including soil and water, domestic and wild animals, and foodstuffs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Environmental MAC isolates and clinical isolates belong to different serovars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, mycobacteria can become aerosolized from aqueous sources, and the more easily aerosolized strains are often phenotypically the same as those that cause pulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Isolates similar or identical to clinical isolates have also been recovered from naturally occurring surface water, hot tubs, and piped hot water systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/20,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23-25</a>]. Prolonged exposure to soil has also been identified as a risk factor for MAC infection in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A study demonstrated that rRNA gene sequences from NTM were enriched to high levels in many showerhead biofilms, supporting previous theories that showers may represent another potential source of MAC infection in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Unlike <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, there are no convincing data demonstrating human-to-human transmission of infection. Thus, the concept prevails that these organisms are acquired from the environment. Furthermore, environmental exposure to these organisms must be common because data from several countries showed that a substantial fraction of children have delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to MAC antigens, a fraction that increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>A smaller survey of skin test reactivity to <em>Mycobacterium intracellulare</em> antigen was reported from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) comparing results from 1971 to 1972 with 1999 to 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Between these two time periods, the prevalence of <em>M. intracellulare</em> sensitization increased from 11.2 to 16.6 percent. The authors concluded that from 1999 to 2000, an estimated one in six persons in the US demonstrated <em>M. intracellulare</em> sensitization, up from one in nine persons from 1971 to 1972. They felt that the observed rising prevalence of sensitization was consistent with observed increases in rates of pulmonary NTM isolates in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of disease'</a> above.)</p><p>The geographic distribution of skin test reactivity to MAC is not uniform. A survey of skin test reactivity to a MAC antigen among 275,000 naval recruits who had lived their entire lives in a single county showed skin test reactivity to be most frequent among recruits from the southeastern and gulf coast states (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56050\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56050 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In these areas, more than 70 percent of individuals had been exposed to or infected with MAC or an antigenically similar organism. </p><p>More recent dual skin test studies have been conducted among healthy individuals in the United States using <em>M. avium</em> sensitin, a reagent that has been shown to be both sensitive and specific in distinguishing past disease due to <em>M. avium</em> from past disease due to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Among 784 subjects from the northern and southern United States, 40 percent of US-born subjects had <em>M. avium</em>-dominant reactions consistent with prior infection with <em>M. avium</em> or other NTM; <em>M. avium</em>-dominant reactions were found in 46 percent of subjects from southern sites and 33 percent from northern sites.

Of the 270 cases identified, 187 were HIV positive, 33 HIV negative, and 50 with HIV status unknown.
