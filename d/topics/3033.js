MN is most often primary (idiopathic), although it has been associated with hepatitis B antigenemia, autoimmune diseases, thyroiditis, malignancies, and the use of certain drugs such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), gold, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a>. In the majority of cases of tumor-associated MN, the malignancy has been diagnosed or is clinically apparent at the time that proteinuria is discovered.</p><p>The pathogenesis, causes, and diagnosis of MN will be reviewed here. The treatment and prognosis of MN are presented separately.

MN in young women should raise the suspicion of lupus. MN is less commonly seen in children, in whom it is often associated with hepatitis B or, less commonly, autoimmune or thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic histologic lesion on light microscopy is diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) throughout all glomeruli in the absence of significant hypercellularity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74698%7ENEPH%2F55226%7ENEPH%2F69629%7ENEPH%2F62937%7ENEPH%2F69348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74698 graphicRef55226 graphicRef69629 graphicRef62937 graphicRef69348 \">picture 1A-E</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the glomeruli may appear entirely normal by light microscopy in early cases of MN, and &quot;spikes&quot; of GBM extending between the immune deposits may be seen with appropriate stains in more advanced cases. Chronic sclerosing glomerular and tubulointerstitial changes develop as the disease progresses.</p><p>Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals a diffuse granular pattern of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C3 staining along the GBM. The hallmark lesions on electron microscopy are subepithelial electron-dense deposits on the outer aspect of the GBM, effacement of the foot processes of the overlying podocyte, and expansion of the GBM by deposition of new extracellular matrix between the deposits (which are the &quot;spikes&quot; seen with special stains).</p><p>Expansion of the GBM occurs over time as the immune deposits separate from the basal surface of the podocytes and become incorporated into the expanded GBM as new extracellular matrix is deposited by the injured podocytes. Thus, the disease may be staged according to the extent to which the subepithelial immune deposits are surrounded by the GBM. This staging, though, bears no relationship to the severity of the proteinuria or responsiveness to treatment.

As an example, in lupus-associated MN, IgG1 and IgG3 may predominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]; by contrast, a predominance of IgG1 and IgG2 has been reported in the putative malignancy-associated MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of the antigen phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) or thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) within immune deposits in a fine, granular, capillary-loop pattern by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry is strongly suggestive of primary MN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F114640\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114640 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Even in the absence of an identifiable underlying systemic disease or offending drug, patients with mesangial deposits may have a more favorable long-term prognosis than those with idiopathic MN limited to the subepithelial space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Animal models of MN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experimental models of MN suggest that the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) immune deposits develop in situ with the movement across the GBM of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against endogenous antigens expressed on or near the podocyte foot processes or against circulating cationic or low-molecular-weight antigens that have crossed the anionic charge barrier in the GBM.</p><p>The pathogenic mechanisms leading to MN have been primarily elucidated from the rat model of Heymann nephritis, which closely resembles the human disease at both the clinical and histologic level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In Heymann nephritis, circulating antibodies target the endocytic receptor megalin (gp330) on podocyte foot processes.

In this study, circulating autoantibodies to PLA2R were identified in 26 of 37 (70 percent) patients with idiopathic MN and could be associated with disease activity in patients for whom serial serum samples were available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. By contrast, there was no evidence of PLA2R antibodies in serum from eight patients with secondary MN due to lupus or hepatitis B; from 15 patients with proteinuric conditions other than MN (such as diabetic nephropathy or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis); or from 30 healthy control individuals. The circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies were predominantly IgG4, the IgG subclass that is most abundant in the glomerular immune deposits in idiopathic (but not secondary) MN. PLA2R colocalized with IgG4 in immune deposits of kidney tissue obtained by kidney biopsy from patients with MN, and anti-PLA2R antibodies could be eluted from this tissue. This was in contrast to the findings in secondary MN biopsies, in which there was no colocalization of IgG4 and PLA2R and from which no anti-PLA2R antibodies could be eluted.</p><p>The majority of anti-PLA2R autoantibodies appear to target a specific region of the PLA2R protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Two independent studies identified three domains near the N-terminus of PLA2R as the dominant epitope for anti-PLA2R [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], and one study further identified a small, nine-amino acid sequence that could largely inhibit the antibody-antigen interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Anti-PLA2R antibodies have been identified in 57, 74, 75, 78, 80, and 82 percent of patients with primary MN in six additional cohorts from Europe and China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-31</a>]. In one study, anti-PLA2R strongly correlated with clinical status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; in another study, lower anti-PLA2R titers were associated with a higher rate of spontaneous remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and, in two other studies, a decline in anti-PLA2R predicted the clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. A fifth study found that higher anti-PLA2R titers within two years of diagnosis predicted substantially greater progression of kidney function decline over the subsequent five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, this may have reflected increased disease activity at the time the serum was collected; lower titers may have identified individuals already undergoing immunological and clinical remission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Resistant disease'</a>.)</p><p>Staining the kidney biopsy specimen for PLA2R, either by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, provides another assay by which to identify PLA2R-associated primary MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/26,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,33,34</a>]. As an example, in the study mentioned above that reported a relatively low sensitivity of circulating anti-PLA2R (57 percent), an additional 24 percent of patients who did not have circulating antibodies had the PLA2R antigen detected within immune deposits by immunofluorescence of the biopsy specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This may occur as patients enter serological remission with still unresolved proteinuria and persistent immune deposits in glomeruli. Theoretically, it could also occur in the early stages of disease as anti-PLA2R antibodies are &quot;soaked up&quot; in the immune deposits and have not yet reached sufficiently high levels to be detected in the serum by existing immunoassays (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F114639\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114639 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. In general, tissue staining for PLA2R may be more sensitive (69 to 84 percent in various studies) than circulating anti-PLA2R in patients with primary MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/26,33,34,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,33,34,38,39</a>]. Specificity is close to 100 percent; however, PLA2R has been detected in the immune deposits of some patients with secondary MN associated with hepatitis B virus infection, neoplasms, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use, or sarcoidosis, but not systemic lupus nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/33,34,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,38,39</a>]. It is possible that this represents a coincidental association, and we regard such cases as having PLA2R-associated MN.</p><p>The detection of circulating anti-PLA2R <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PLA2R kidney immune deposits in the majority of adult patients with idiopathic MN represents a large step forward in our understanding of the disease as investigators will now be able to test whether the pathogenetic mechanisms learned from experimental models are also involved in human disease. The sensitivity and specificity of anti-PLA2R autoantibodies in individuals with immunologically active idiopathic MN have also enabled the development of a serologic immunoassay for the noninvasive diagnosis of primary MN and monitoring of disease activity. It should be noted that, while the association of these anti-PLA2R autoantibodies with disease suggests a causal role, this has not yet been confirmed experimentally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481796210\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>THSD7A is, like PLA2R, a transmembrane protein expressed on podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. THSD7A may be the responsible antigen in approximately 10 percent of patients with idiopathic MN who are negative for anti-PLA2R antibodies. The association of THSD7A with MN was examined in a study of 154 patients with anti-PLA2R-negative idiopathic MN, 74 patients with anti-PLA2R-positive idiopathic MN, 76 patients with other glomerular disease, and 44 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Autoantibodies specific for THSD7A were identified in sera from 15 of 154 patients with anti-PLA2R-negative idiopathic MN but not in the sera from other individuals. In addition, the IgG that was eluted from the kidney biopsies of 1 of these 15 patients was specific for THSD7A, providing further support that THSD7A was the target antigen in these patients. THSD7A-associated MN has been found at a low frequency in North American and European cohorts, but it may be more prevalent in Japanese patients with primary MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>THSD7A may also be involved in the pathogenesis of some cases of malignancy-associated MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The transplacental passage of anti-NEP antibodies (from mothers genetically deficient in NEP who were alloimmunized during a prior pregnancy) caused MN with subepithelial immune deposits (anti-NEP and NEP) in the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/neonate</span>. Nephrotic syndrome resolved several months after birth, with disappearance of the deposits, upon clearance of the maternal antibodies. Although noncomplement-fixing IgG4 was the predominant IgG subclass of anti-NEP in alloimmunized NEP-deficient mothers, the development of proteinuria in their babies correlated with the additional presence of complement-fixing IgG1 anti-NEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

It has yet to be determined, however, whether the IgG4 anti-PLA2R antibodies that predominate in idiopathic MN or accompanying IgG1 antibodies are responsible for complement activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5350192\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracellular antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the PLA2R, THSD7A, and NEP, antibodies directed against other antigens expressed by podocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. In one study, for example, serum IgG4 reactivity against aldose reductase, superoxide dismutase 2, and alpha-enolase, as well as the PLA2R and neutral endopeptidase, was measured in 186 patients with MN, 36 patients with focal glomerulosclerosis, and 60 patients with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Elevated titers of IgG4 against the PLA2R, alpha-enolase, aldose reductase, and superoxide dismutase 2 were found in 60, 43, 34, and 28 percent of patients with MN, respectively, but not in patients with other glomerular diseases. Approximately one-half of the patients who were negative for antibodies against the PLA2R had an elevated titer for one of the other three antibodies. Although these antigens are predominantly intracellular, it has been proposed that podocyte injury causes the intracellular enzymes to translocate to the cell surface where they are accessible to the circulating antibodies, causing amplification of the immune injury and possibly aggravating the course of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93126072\"><span class=\"h3\">Cationic bovine serum albumin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies to a cationic form of bovine serum albumin (BSA) are present in a small number of children with MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

However, there are certain findings on electron microscopy and immunofluorescence that suggest secondary disease (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary MN'</a> above). In addition, the identification of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies in primary but not secondary forms of MN permits the discrimination of these two entities in most cases.

Homozygous expression of the HLA-DQA1 allele conferred a higher risk for disease compared with the PLA2R allele (odds ratios of 20.2 versus 4.2, respectively). The homozygous expression of both alleles additively increased the risk of disease (odds ratio 78.5).

One possibility is the coincident production of ANCA or anti-GBM antibodies and the antibody responsible for MN in an individual predisposed to autoimmune disorders. An alternative mechanism is that GBM injury induced by the membranous lesion may expose previously &quot;unseen&quot; antigens, leading to anti-GBM antibody production.</p><p>A study from a major renal pathology laboratory identified 14 patients with both MN and ANCA-associated necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis; both conditions were diagnosed simultaneously in most of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. In a review of over 13,000 native kidney biopsies processed by the same laboratory, idiopathic MN was present in 8.8 percent and ANCA-associated necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis was present in 3.4 percent. Based upon these numbers, concurrent disease would have been expected by chance in 39 patients, well above the observed 14 cases. It was therefore concluded that concurrent disease represented a chance occurrence of two unrelated disease processes.</p><p>The findings were different in a retrospective review of 218 patients with MN; 10 (4.6 percent) had crescentic glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. The incidence was much higher than would be expected for the random co-occurrence of the two disorders. ANCA were present in four of the nine patients who were tested. In one such case, the patient tested positive for both ANCA and anti-PLA2R [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with MN (approximately 80 percent) present with the nephrotic syndrome; the remainder are diagnosed following an evaluation for asymptomatic proteinuria.

Proteinuria is typically present for several months prior to the diagnosis of MN by renal biopsy, which highlights the more gradual development of this disease process. Other common abnormalities on urinalysis and urine microscopy include oval fat bodies, lipid droplets, and fatty casts.

Glucosuria in the presence of normal blood glucose levels is common in patients with nephrotic syndrome, probably a consequence of tubular dysfunction from the heavy albuminuria.</p><p>Hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperlipidemia are almost always present at diagnosis in patients with the nephrotic syndrome but usually not in patients with subnephrotic proteinuria.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is uncommon and may be due to hypovolemia due to aggressive diuresis, acute interstitial nephritis due to diuretics or other offending drugs, superimposed crescentic glomerulonephritis (which is associated with an active sediment), or, rarely, from acute renal vein thrombosis leading to renal infarction.

However, it is important to note that positive testing for serum anti-PLA2R antibodies can coexist with other markers of secondary disease (eg, hepatitis B antigen, antinuclear antibodies [ANAs]), and a kidney biopsy would be indicated in such cases to look for other histopathologic clues that would help to differentiate between primary versus secondary MN. In addition, patients with other atypical features such as red blood cell or white blood cell casts on examination of the urinary sediment or rapidly worsening renal function should undergo a kidney biopsy to exclude superimposed crescentic glomerulonephritis and to assess the degree of chronic damage, even in the presence of positive anti-PLA2R serology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1874185895\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to the diagnosis of MN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all patients with proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrotic syndrome who are suspected of having MN, we obtain a thorough history to determine if the patient has had a history of drug use (such as excessive use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), infections (such as hepatitis B or C), autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), or cancer.

Thus, a positive test, although highly suggestive of primary MN, does not exclude the coexistence of hepatitis virus infection, malignancy, or another associated rheumatologic or inflammatory disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrotic patients without MN seldom (and perhaps never) have a positive test for the anti-PLA2R antibody. Thus, a positive test essentially rules out other causes of nephrotic syndrome (such as minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/29,136\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,136</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with primary MN, testing for anti-PLA2R antibodies may provide additional information regarding treatment response. In one study involving 514 patients with primary MN and positive staining for PLA2R on kidney biopsy, patients with anti-PLA2R antibodies at the time of biopsy had a lower rate of complete remission (proteinuria of &lt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> at 24 months compared with those without anti-PLA2R antibodies (36 versus 61 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. In addition, some data suggest that a falling anti-PLA2R titer indicates that an immunological remission is underway, whereas a persistently high titer is associated with a less favorable clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/29,30,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30,137</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1377658577\"><span class=\"h3\">When to monitor anti-PLA2R titers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial assessment of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibody titers may be useful for both diagnosis and for monitoring the immunological activity of disease when treatment decisions are being considered (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>). As mentioned above, there are several reported cases of patients who were initially negative for anti-PLA2R and subsequently tested positive several months later as their disease progressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>] (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Phospholipase A2 receptor'</a> above). Thus, in an otherwise-stable patient who has an initially negative serum anti-PLA2R antibody test but wishes to avoid kidney biopsy, we would repeat testing three to four months later as part of an ongoing diagnostic evaluation of their kidney disease.</p><p>The trajectory of the immunologic disease course in MN may also be determined by monitoring serial anti-PLA2R titers, several months apart. A declining titer in the absence of immunosuppressive treatment may suggest that the patient is undergoing a spontaneous remission, while increasing or persistently high titers of anti-PLA2R suggest worsening disease that is likely to require immunosuppressive treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2587949258\"><span class=\"h2\">Utility of anti-THSD7A testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the availability of clinical assays for anti-thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) remains limited and there is no US FDA-approved test to date, such testing is likely to become more routine in the future. An indirect immunofluorescence test has already been developed that can provide semiquantitative titers for anti-THSD7A in much the same way as the US FDA-approved indirect immunofluorescence test for anti-PLA2R [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Given the low frequency of THSD7A-associated cases relative to PLA2R-associated cases of MN, we generally limit serum testing for anti-THSD7A antibody to patients who are seronegative for anti-PLA2R <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exhibit negative PLA2R staining on kidney biopsy. The one caveat to this approach is the fact that rare cases of dual-positive (anti-PLA2R and anti-THSD7A) MN have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should have age- and risk-appropriate cancer screening, whether or not they are diagnosed with MN.

In most patients, the cancer has already been diagnosed or is clinically apparent (overt) when the patient presents with proteinuria. Uncommonly, the diagnosis of MN precedes that of the malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, patients without known cancer who are diagnosed with MN should undergo age- and risk-appropriate cancer screening, if not already performed. A diagnosis of MN should <strong>not</strong> prompt an extensive search for occult malignancy in the absence of some suggestive finding such an extensive smoking history, guaiac-positive stools, or unexplained anemia or weight loss. Although microscopic hematuria is common in MN, cystoscopy is indicated among patients with risk factors for bladder cancer.

Patients with a positive anti-PLA2R antibody test <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those whose kidney histology is consistent with primary MN therefore only require cancer screening at the same frequency as the general population.</p><p>However, if the anti-PLA2R antibody test is negative or the kidney histology is consistent with secondary MN and if there is no other clear cause of secondary MN, then such patients may require, in our opinion, more frequent age- and risk-appropriate screening for malignancy. In one study of patients with biopsy-proven MN, a negative test for serum anti-PLA2R conferred a nearly 10-fold higher risk of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].

Mesangial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subendothelial deposits may also be seen with secondary forms of MN, which suggest an associated immune complex disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary MN'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immune deposits that are characteristic of this disorder may develop in situ with the movement across the GBM of circulating IgG antibodies directed against endogenous antigens expressed on or near the podocyte foot processes or against circulating cationic or low-molecular-weight antigens that have crossed the anionic charge barrier in the GBM. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), a major antigen expressed on podocytes, are specifically found in a high proportion of patients with primary (idiopathic) MN. Antibodies to thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A), another podocyte antigen, have been found to identify a smaller subset of patients with primary MN. Neutral endopeptidase is an antigen in an antenatal form of MN, and antibodies to cationic bovine serum albumin (BSA) may be found in some children with MN. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MN is most often primary (idiopathic), associated with the presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies; although, it has been associated with a variety of conditions, including hepatitis B antigenemia; autoimmune diseases (eg, lupus); malignancy; and the use of certain drugs such as gold, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). MN may also be seen in conjunction with other glomerular diseases such as diabetic nephropathy and crescentic glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Membranous nephropathy with other glomerular diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with MN present with the nephrotic syndrome, but some have only asymptomatic proteinuria. The serum creatinine is generally normal or near normal on initial presentation, and the majority of patients are normotensive. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Historically, a kidney biopsy was required to establish the diagnosis of MN; however, due to the identification of target antigens and the specificity of serologic assays for anti-PLA2R antibodies, many clinicians elect to begin with a serologic-based diagnostic approach, particularly if there are relative contraindications to performing a biopsy. In general, we prefer to use a serologic-based diagnostic approach, which may obviate the need for a kidney biopsy in patients with positive anti-PLA2R serology, normal kidney function, and no evidence of secondary causes of MN. (See <a href=\"#H1874185895\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the diagnosis of MN'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial assessment of anti-PLA2R antibody titers may be useful for both diagnosis and for monitoring the immunological activity of disease when treatment decisions are being considered. Patients who are initially negative for anti-PLA2R may subsequently test positive several months later as their disease progresses. Thus, in an otherwise-stable patient who has an initially negative serum anti-PLA2R antibody test but wishes to avoid kidney biopsy, we would repeat testing three to four months later as part of an ongoing diagnostic evaluation of their kidney disease. The trajectory of the immunologic disease course in MN may also be determined by monitoring serial anti-PLA2R titers, several months apart. A declining titer in the absence of immunosuppressive treatment may suggest that the patient is undergoing a spontaneous remission, while increasing or persistently high titers of anti-PLA2R suggest worsening disease that is likely to require immunosuppressive treatment.

The frequency of cancer screening after a diagnosis of MN depends, in part, upon whether or not the disease is primary or secondary and, if secondary, whether or not there is another clear cause of secondary MN.
