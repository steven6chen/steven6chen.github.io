The clinical manifestation of hypothermia in children, neonatal hypothermia, and frostbite are discussed separately.

The stage of hypothermia, defined by core temperature, has a major impact on both recognition and treatment. The most commonly used definitions found in the literature are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild</strong> &ndash; Core temperature 32 to 35&deg;C (90 to 95&deg;F)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate</strong> &ndash; Core temperature 28 to 32&deg;C (82 to 90&deg;F)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe</strong> &ndash; Core temperature below 28&deg;C (82&deg;F)</p><p/><p>Some experts regard a core temperature &lt;25&deg;C (77&deg;F) as profound hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Exact temperature cutoffs vary slightly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; all cutoffs are approximate because of variation in individual patients and imprecise temperature measurement. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of mild hypothermia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of moderate or severe hypothermia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothermia in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Core body temperature should be measured as soon as possible. Clinical recognition schemes have been suggested for rescue and prehospital settings but emphasize that, except in the presence of obvious lethal injuries, the clinical declaration of death should not be made without a thermometer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].

Several modifications to standard pediatric advanced life support guidelines are suggested for patients with moderate or severe hypothermia.

Hypothermic patients without circulation have made intact recoveries from core temperatures as low as 14&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Intact recoveries have been reported after submersion for up to 66 to 83 minutes, after hours of transport without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), with CPR times as long as six and a half hours, and after total resuscitation up to nine hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/1,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-10</a>]. A large number of cases and case series document intact survival from severe hypothermia with clinical indicators that would otherwise signify death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Core temperature measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The accurate measurement of core body temperature in children with hypothermia is essential to proper treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Ideally, children with suspected hypothermia should have their core temperature taken with a low-reading flexible thermometer probe either rectally or ideally, at a central site (eg, bladder, esophageal, nasopharyngeal, or central venous site).</p><p>Rectal temperature may lag behind core body temperature, sometimes severely. When possible, central sites are preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Measurement artifacts are reduced if two or more separate central sites can be measured in critical care cases (eg, rectal and esophageal or central venous catheter probe).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prehospital rescue and triage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians may be involved in directing prehospital care and triage of hypothermic patients. Suspicion of hypothermia is vital. Rescuers and medical control clinicians should consider hypothermia not only in children with obvious environmental exposure but also in all children who have altered mental status or who require critical care.</p><p>The measurement of core temperature in the field is difficult. Though subject to artifact, low-reading indirect tympanic thermometers may be useful if they identify the presence of hypothermia. However, these thermometers should not be relied upon to determine definitive warming techniques once the patient arrives in the hospital. The degree of hypothermia may also be estimated from clinical findings in the field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62978 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].

Moreover, such patients often lack findings that make severe hypothermia detectable without proper temperature measurement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothermia in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p>A few rare circumstances may suggest prehospital declaration of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rescue is impossible </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other injuries are clearly lethal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valid &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; orders are in place.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Prehospital patient care and transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prehospital providers should avoid patient exertion and rough handling during rescue of patients with hypothermia because these actions may cause mobilization of cold and acidic blood to the heart and cause cardiac arrhythmias or arrest in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients should be extracted from the cold environment in a horizontal position, if possible.</p><p>Many hypothermic patients arrive at the hospital colder than they left the scene. Rescue, transport, and treatment involve multiple risks for iatrogenic cooling. During transport, rescuers should do all that is possible to prevent further patient heat loss. Key interventions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of wet clothing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gentle insulation of the patient with blankets or sleeping bags</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warming of the transport vehicle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of warm IV fluids, if possible</p><p/><p>For children with moderate or severe hypothermia, external rewarming is generally avoided in transport. Evidence even in adults suggests that such rewarming may promote afterdrop, a continued decline in temperature after rescue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The child's increased ability to vasoconstrict the peripheral circulation would suggest that afterdrop might be more likely in children than adults. </p><p>We prefer to avoid active external rewarming in transport. If external rewarming is considered for advanced-care transport, then forced-air rewarming is suggested. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Active external rewarming'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with moderate hypothermia warrant transport to a hospital with pediatric intensive care capability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/3,5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,22</a>]. Those patients with severe hypothermia should ideally undergo transport to a hospital with active core rewarming or cardiopulmonary bypass facilities. Level I designated pediatric trauma centers usually have such capabilities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2163193876\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial hospital care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothermic children should be maintained in a horizontal supine position and handled gently. The clinician should remove wet clothing and insulate the victim from further exposure (eg, dry blankets). The application of external heat, although almost automatic in many centers, should be avoided when circulation is impaired. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Severe hypothermia with absent circulation'</a> below.)</p><p>Administration of heated, humidified oxygen is an acceptable therapy for all hypothermic patients. The amount of rewarming provided by this treatment is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The ideal gas temperature, based on the highest delivered temperature that will not cause harm, is 45&deg;C (113&deg;F). However, even at 41&deg;C, inspiration of humidified oxygen prevents further heat loss.</p><p>Any intravenous (IV) fluid (eg, normal saline) administered in volume should be heated to 40 to 44&deg;C (104 to 111&deg;F) because rapid IV infusion of room temperature (eg, 21&deg;C [70&deg;F]) solutions will cause further cooling and may precipitate ventricular fibrillation or asystole. </p><p>Although heating of IV fluids is vital to prevent further cooling, this method alone cannot transmit enough heat to achieve rewarming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Delivery of warmed IV fluids requires the use of specific technologies, such as trauma-style fluid warmers with short, large-bore, insulated, or countercurrent tubing. Standard coil blood warmers will not effectively warm fluid and standard IV tubing will not keep it warm as it passes to the patient. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Vascular access and intravenous fluid therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Rewarming techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rewarming is an essential procedure when managing the hypothermic patient. The clinician needs to understand the classes of rewarming methods available, the proper choice of rewarming class based upon core body temperature given the presence or absence of circulation, and the potential drawbacks of different methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Passive rewarming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passive rewarming involves removing cold or wet clothing and applying dry insulation, such as blankets, in a warm environment. Passive rewarming requires the child to generate heat and does not offer specific patient support. Passive methods may help prevent further cooling but must be accompanied by appropriate active rewarming techniques when treating children with hypothermia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Active external rewarming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active external rewarming techniques apply heat externally to the patient. These include forced air rewarming (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51942\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51942 \">picture 1</a>), radiant heat, and the application of chemical heat packs or plumbed water heating pads. </p><p>Active external rewarming techniques are simple to perform and are widely available. However, they have the potential to promote afterdrop (further cooling), hypotension (rewarming shock), ventricular fibrillation, or asystole in patients with moderate or severe hypothermia. These adverse effects arise from mobilization of cold and acidic blood into the central circulation, especially if the extremities are warmed early. Thus, if these methods are used, the trunk should be warmed first. </p><p>Forced air rewarming may lessen the potential for burns of under-perfused skin sometimes seen with the application of direct heat by heating packs or pads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Small adult series suggest it may also decrease afterdrop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>Active external rewarming may be harmful or ineffective or both in patients with severe hypothermia or absent circulation and should be avoided in such cases unless no other measures are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Although simple, and useful to prevent further cooling, these methods do not promote much rewarming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Invasive</strong> &ndash; Invasive techniques have included heated saline lavage of the pleura, bladder, stomach, or peritoneum. Invasive techniques, especially pleural lavage, are suggested for patients with severe hypothermia (core temperature &lt;28&deg;C [82&deg;F]), especially with some preserved circulation, or those with inadequate response to initial rewarming (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63502 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Administration of warmed intravenous normal saline lessens further cooling. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Vascular access and intravenous fluid therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Ongoing monitoring of core temperature and continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm and circulatory status are essential to ensure that these patients respond appropriately to rewarming (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63502 \">table 1</a>). Children can show marked core afterdrop (further cooling) even in mild hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>If environmental exposure is not a factor, underlying medical conditions (eg, sepsis, hypoglycemia, or hyponatremia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88088 \">table 3</a>)) may be the etiology for mild hypothermia. Such children may be more ill-appearing or display symptoms that cannot be attributed to mild hypothermia alone (eg, lethargy, hypotension). Diagnostic testing and appropriate treatment should be instituted as soon as possible in these circumstances. Rewarming may be incomplete in these patients until the underlying medical etiology is identified and treated.

Cardiac rhythm should be closely monitored during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Direct laryngoscopy may be difficult in severe hypothermia, because muscular rigidity prevents jaw movement. Oral intubation using advanced airway adjuncts (eg, fiberoptic bronchoscope, video laryngoscopy, bougie) may be helpful.

Rapid bedside cardiac ultrasound may assist in differentiating cardiac contractions with a perfusing rhythm from pulseless electrical activity. However, these determinations may be difficult, and standard chest compressions should be provided without delay if there is any uncertainty about core temperature or a perfusing rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Patients with nonperfusing rhythms should receive chest compressions using standard rates and depths. Chest compressions will be difficult due to muscular rigidity, but the former use of open cardiac massage is now discouraged because the myocardium will also be rigid in such cases, and the closed-chest mechanics of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) will be lost.

However, vascular access is vital because aggressive, warmed volume expansion is a cornerstone of treatment for moderate and severe hypothermia. If adequate peripheral intravenous (IV) access (two 22 gauge or larger peripheral IVs) is not rapidly available, then the clinician should place an intraosseous needle or central line via the femoral vein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraosseous-infusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraosseous infusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular (venous) access for pediatric resuscitation and other pediatric emergencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with moderate or severe hypothermia become disproportionately hypovolemic from diuresis and fluid shifts.

Delivering fluid that is less than normal body temperature (37&deg;C [98.6&deg;F]) can worsen core hypothermia. Additional IV boluses should be repeated as per standard pediatric shock resuscitation protocols, bearing in mind that aggressive and ongoing volume expansion is usually required in hypothermia.

Measurements of central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation may help guide resuscitation. Femoral central line placement is preferred since catheters placed above the diaphragm may contact the myocardium and precipitate ventricular arrhythmias in hypothermic patients.

Because water temperature is seldom known with any certainty, resuscitation and rewarming should be provided if any doubt exists. </p><p>In our experience, the best approach is to rewarm and support the patient and then let the course declare itself. Although concern exists about producing hypothermia survivors who are neurologically devastated, limited evidence suggests that severely impaired survival may be uncommon. In a series of 46 adults with severe hypothermia (core temperature &lt;28&deg;C [82&deg;F]) and cardiac arrest, 32 patients were selected for rewarming by extracorporeal methods. Fifteen of these patients had long-term survival, and none had serious long-term neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, patients who are hypothermic after drowning in water that is obviously not cold (eg, a summertime swimming pool) will not be protected from anoxia.

Cold, acidemic blood pooled in the vasoconstricted extremities returns to the core circulation, causing a drop in temperature and pH. At the same time, peripheral vasodilation may trigger hypotension, inadequate coronary perfusion, and ventricular fibrillation. Rewarming shock may be fatal if rewarming is not accompanied by vigorous support of hypovolemic shock and circulatory instability typically seen in children with moderate or severe hypothermia. Thus, children with moderate hypothermia should have appropriate intravenous access and receive rapid infusion of warmed normal saline from the initiation of rewarming.

These methods include heated saline lavage of the pleural space, bladder, stomach, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peritoneum. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Left pleural lavage with heated normal saline is our preferred active internal rewarming method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/43-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-48</a>]. This procedure is performed by placing two chest tubes in the left pleural cavity that are positioned so that inflow is anterior and drainage is posterior. Fluid heated to 40 to 44&deg;C (104 to 111&deg;F) is instilled through the anterior chest tube and warms the heart directly. Some clinicians have chosen right pleural lavage because it avoids the theoretical risk of the left ventricle being struck by the chest tube during insertion and causing ventricular fibrillation. Right pleural lavage may, however, be a slightly less effective method of rewarming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Heated normal saline lavage of the stomach, bladder, colon, and peritoneum are generally less effective than pleural lavage, but all have been used successfully in some cases. Gastric lavage risks pulmonary aspiration in these critically ill patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The need to rapidly provide large quantities of heated saline presents a practical challenge for all of the lavage techniques. Preplanning may suggest solutions, such as using trauma-suite IV warmers or peritoneal-dialysis heating tubs. In one case, successful resuscitation was achieved with pleural lavage using 75 L of heated tap water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Forced air external rewarming</strong> &ndash; Heated forced air rewarming alone may be tried in children if active internal rewarming methods are delayed or if large volumes of heated fluid are <strong>not</strong> available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/3,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27-29</a>]. Successful rewarming using forced air rewarming in patients with absent circulation is not well documented.

Delays, however, have not prevented success.

Although impaired circulation limits the effectiveness and increases the hazards of external rewarming, combined measures including active external rewarming have at times been effective. Forced air rewarming has at times been used in these combined rewarming efforts. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other extracorporeal methods</strong> &ndash; Successful core rewarming with intact survival has been described using hemodialysis and hemofiltration systems as well as arteriovenous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and venovenous shunts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, these methods have much slower rewarming rates than ECMO or bypass methods (2 to 3&deg;C per hour [3.6 to 5.4&deg;F per hour] versus 9.8&deg;C per hour [17.6&deg;F per hour]). The methods are not widely available, and may be difficult to perform in infants and young children. When these methods are used, prolonged CPR up to and beyond four hours may be required but may still produce intact recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endovascular temperature control catheter</strong> &ndash; Endovascular temperature control catheters can be placed in a central vein (eg, inferior vena cava) and allow for warmed or cooled fluid, contained in a closed loop system in the tip, to directly heat or cool blood in the central circulation. For example, a case report describes the successful use of this technique in rewarming an adult with severe hypothermia (core temperature of 22.7&deg;C [73.0&deg;F]) and a poorly perfusing cardiac rhythm. Rewarming occurred at a rate of 2.8&deg;C (3.8&deg;F) per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In this instance, the endovascular temperature control catheter was used instead of cardiac bypass or left pleural lavage and was felt to be less invasive. Further study appears warranted before this method is widely adopted for children.</p><p/><p>In the past, choosing a rate of warming was emphasized, but experience suggests that the rewarming rate is determined more by the patient's circulation and metabolism than by the clinician. In addition, excessively rapid rewarming is not an issue if sufficient support is provided for blood volume and circulation.

The stage of hypothermia, defined by core temperature, has a large impact on both recognition and treatment. The most commonly used definitions are as follows (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition of hypothermia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Mild</strong> &ndash; Core temperature 32 to 35&deg;C (90 to 95&deg;F)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Moderate</strong> &ndash; Core temperature 28 to 32&deg;C (82 to 90&deg;F)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Severe</strong> &ndash; Core temperature below 28&deg;C (82&deg;F)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The degree of hypothermia may be estimated from clinical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62978 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accurate measurement of core body temperature in children with hypothermia is essential to proper treatment. Children with suspected hypothermia should have their core temperature taken with a low-reading flexible thermometer probe either rectally or ideally, at a central site (eg, bladder, esophageal, nasopharyngeal, or central vein). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Core temperature measurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cases of severe hypothermia, almost all prognostic features that suggest discontinuation of resuscitation prior to rewarming may be dangerously misleading. (See <a href=\"#H2274972869\" class=\"local\">'Decision to resuscitate and rewarm'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of hypothermia is directed toward resuscitation, assessment of the extent of injury, and rewarming as guided by core body temperature and circulatory status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63502 \">table 1</a>). Delivery of heated (41 to 45&deg;C [105.8 to 113&deg;F]), humidified oxygen and IV fluids heated to 40 to 44&deg;C (104 to 111&deg;F) prevents further cooling and is desirable for any patient. The clinician should perform endotracheal intubation in patients with respiratory failure, coma, or shock. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Airway and breathing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderate or severe hypothermia are almost always hypovolemic and warrant aggressive fluid resuscitation. All intravenous fluids delivered in high volume should be warmed (40 to 44&deg;C [104 to 111&deg;F]) to avoid worsening of hypothermia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63502 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Vascular access and intravenous fluid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to warmed humidified oxygen and heated intravenous normal saline, we suggest that children with intact circulation and moderate hypothermia (core temperature 28 to 32&deg;C [82 to 90&deg;F]) receive active external rewarming, preferably by forced air rewarming (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51942\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51942 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). When other external methods are used, rewarming of the trunk should occur <strong>before</strong> the extremities to minimize the chance of hypotension (ie, rewarming shock), ventricular fibrillation, or asystole caused by core afterdrop. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Moderate hypothermia with intact circulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Severe hypothermia with intact circulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Active external rewarming'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that children with severe hypothermia (core temperature &lt;28&deg;C [82&deg;F]) but preserved circulation be warmed by active internal rewarming (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These methods include heated saline lavage, especially of the left pleural space, or possibly the bladder, stomach, or peritoneum. Heated forced air rewarming may be useful if active internal rewarming methods are delayed or large volumes of heated fluid are unavailable. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Severe hypothermia with intact circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with moderate or severe hypothermia and nonperfusing cardiac rhythms, extracorporeal or aggressive active internal rewarming is the primary therapy. We suggest that children with severe hypothermia (core temperature &lt;28&deg;C [82&deg;F]) and absent circulation undergo rapid rewarming with extracorporeal methods (eg, cardiac bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), if available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Severe hypothermia with absent circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfusing rhythms associated with hypothermia include sinus bradycardia, first degree atrioventricular block, and atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response. Cardiac pacing is typically ineffective and is not employed in children with significant hypothermia because perfusing slow cardiac rhythms are felt to be adequate for maintaining sufficient oxygen delivery in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Perfusing bradycardic rhythms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hypothermia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) without a pulse may be refractory to conventional therapy until the patient has been rewarmed. These patients may receive initial defibrillation and pharmacologic therapy as indicated by pediatric advanced life support, but if initial attempts are unsuccessful, basic life support and aggressive rewarming must be promptly initiated. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular arrhythmias with hypothermia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asystole or pulseless electrical activity and severe hypothermia (core temperature &lt;28&deg;C [82&deg;F]) should receive airway support (endotracheal intubation), chest compressions, and active internal rewarming (eg, extracorporeal warming). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Asystole or pulseless electrical activity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Chest compressions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the neuroprotective effects of hypothermia, complete recovery of patients with hypothermia and cardiac arrest has been well documented despite prolonged resuscitation. Thus, under usual circumstances, resuscitative efforts should be continued at length (if need be, for hours) until the core temperature is approximately 34 to 35&deg;C (93 to 95&deg;F) or there is a return of spontaneous circulation. Resuscitation can be withheld if obviously lethal injuries are present. Some experts also suggest that survival is also unlikely in patients with a serum potassium &gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.
