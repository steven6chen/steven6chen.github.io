Microdeletions, or submicroscopic deletions, are chromosomal deletions that are too small to be detected by light microscopy using conventional cytogenetic methods. Specialized testing is needed to identify these deletions. Microdeletions are typically 1 to 3 Mb long and involve several contiguous genes. The exact size and location of a microdeletion that causes a syndrome may vary, but a specific &quot;critical region&quot; is consistently involved. Most phenotypic effects of these microdeletions are due to haploinsufficiency of a few critical genes or, in some cases, a single gene.</p><p>This topic reviews microdeletion syndromes involving chromosomes 12 through 22. Microdeletion syndromes involving chromosomes 1 through 11 are discussed separately, as are microduplication syndromes and congenital abnormalities of the sex chromosomes. Other congenital chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomies, are also reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 1 to 11)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microduplication-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microduplication syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-chromosome-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sex chromosome abnormalities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4404803\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF GENOMIC DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genomic disorders are diseases that result from the loss or gain of <span class=\"nowrap\">chromosomal/DNA</span> material. The most common and better delineated genomic disorders are divided in two main categories: those resulting from copy number losses (deletion syndromes) and copy number gains (duplication syndromes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Copy number variations (CNVs) are submicroscopic genomic differences in the number of copies of one or more sections of DNA that result in DNA gains or losses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67644 \">figure 1</a>). Some CNVs are pathogenic and cause syndromic disorders with consistent phenotypic features, as are discussed here. Other CNVs are associated with disease susceptibility or resistance, and the same CNV can be associated with several diverse disorders. Still other CNVs are part of normal genetic variation and have no recognized disease association. Contiguous gene syndromes can occur when CNVs affect several adjacent genes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;, section on 'Copy number variations (CNVs)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease#H1031916\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;, section on 'Copy number variation'</a>.)</p><p>The main mechanism that leads to disease in genomic disorders secondary to deletions and duplications is a change in the copy number of a dose-sensitive gene or genes. Other disease mechanisms include interference with imprinted genes and with regulatory elements outside genes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview#H16722227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;, section on 'Disease mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>Genomic disorders are typically detected by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58888\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58888 \">figure 2</a>). Some laboratories confirm gains or losses detected on an array with an independent method, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), multiple ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA), or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR).

Intellectual disability and facial dysmorphic features also may occur and depend upon the size of the deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Retinoblastoma is caused by mutational inactivation of both alleles of the retinoblastoma (<em>RB1</em>) gene that encodes a tumor suppressor. Children with an <em>RB1</em> germline mutation or with deletions of <em>RB1</em>, as is seen in patients with 13q deletion, are at increased risk for retinoblastoma and need regular eye examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The evaluation and management of retinoblastoma are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinoblastoma-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinoblastoma: Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinoblastoma: Treatment and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8964739\"><span class=\"h1\">15q11.2 DELETION SYNDROME (BP1-BP2)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The region proximal (more centromeric) to the Prader-Willi syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(PWS)/Angelman</span> syndrome (AS) region in chromosome 15 has significant variability in the general population. The deletions and duplications of the region between breakpoints 1 and 2 (BP1-BP2) were considered benign and probably familial variations. However, several reports indicate that deletions in this region may be associated with developmental delay and behavioral abnormalities in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Many people who carry these deletions are asymptomatic, which can be attributed to nonpenetrance or the need of additional modifiers (genetic and environmental factors). There are four highly conserved genes in this region: <em>NIPA1</em>, <em>NIPA2</em>, <em>CYFIP1</em>, and <em>GCP5</em>. These genes are not imprinted, and patients with this deletion have normal methylation studies for the 15q11-q13 region. These deletions are not be confused with larger deletions that cause AS or PWS. As shown in many other deletion syndromes on chromosome 15, these rearrangements occur around well-known breakpoints. These breakpoints are areas of the genome that are more prone to recombination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86261867\"><span class=\"h1\">15q11-13 MATERNAL DELETION SYNDROME (ANGELMAN SYNDROME)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small interstitial deletion between 15q11 and 15q13 can result in two completely different clinical syndromes depending upon the parental origin of the chromosome. A paternally derived chromosome 15 with this deletion results in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), whereas a maternally derived chromosome 15 with a similar deletion is associated with Angelman syndrome (AS). (See <a href=\"#H8964746\" class=\"local\">'15q11-13 paternal deletion syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome)'</a> below.)</p><p>AS (MIM #105830) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, and a movement or balance disorder, usually in the form of gait ataxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tremulous movement of limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. AS patients may have any combination of the following behavior characteristics: frequent laughter or smiling; apparent happy demeanor with emotional lability; an easily excitable personality, often with hand flapping movements; hypermotoric behavior; fascination with water; mouthing behaviors; and a short attention span. More than 80 percent of individuals with AS have seizures by the time they reach two years of age. Abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) are common with large-amplitude slow-spike waves that can be seen even in the absence of seizures. Sleep is often compromised with frequent waking and altered sleep cycles. Reported gastrointestinal problems include constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cyclic vomiting, swallowing dysfunction, and eosinophilic esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Many of these manifestations continue into adolescence and adulthood, and additional features include obesity, scoliosis, limited verbal communication, and self-injurious behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>AS is caused by absence of the maternally inherited copy of the <em>UBE3A</em> gene. <em>UBE3A</em> maps to chromosome 15q11-q13 and encodes E6 associated protein ubiquitin protein ligase 3A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. <em>UBE3A</em> is subject to genomic imprinting (the differential expression of genetic information depending upon whether the information is inherited from the father or the mother). The maternally inherited copy of the <em>UBE3A</em> gene is functional, and the paternally inherited copy is inactive or silenced. In the normal situation, a functional copy or active of <em>UBE3A</em> from the maternal chromosome prevents AS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H1457606458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Parent-of-origin effects (imprinting)'</a>.)</p><p>There are four known molecular defects of <em>UBE3A</em> that result in AS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classical deletions (approximately 5 to 7 megabases [Mb]) of maternal chromosome 15q11-q13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], where both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father, and no chromosome 15 (including <em>UBE3A</em>) is inherited from the mother.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imprinting center defects, causing the maternal chromosome to have the methylation and gene expression pattern of a paternal chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Point mutations in <em>UBE3A,</em> which produce no functional gene product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>Deletions account for over 70 percent of cases of AS. There are a number of breakpoints (BPs; chromosome regions prone to rearrangement) in the 15q11-q13 region known as BP1, BP2, and BP3. Deletions in this region can be subclassified into class I and class II deletions based upon these BPs. Class I deletions are larger and extend from BP1 to BP3, while class II deletions extend from BP2 to BP3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with class I deletions tend to have greater disease severity when compared with class II patients, with greater difficulties in expressive language, need for more seizure medications, and higher incidence of autism spectrum disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>If AS is suspected, the workup should include methylation studies first, followed by chromosome microarray (array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH]). If methylation studies are positive, the next step is to determine by microarray if the patient has a class I or class II deletion. If aCGH array is negative, options include UPD studies to determine if the patient has paternal UPD using microsatellite DNA markers or, if available, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array. If an SNP array or composite array is used, it is usually possible to determine whether there is UPD by analysis of the SNP data in the <span class=\"nowrap\">AS/PWS</span> critical region. If UPD studies are negative, imprinting center studies are warranted. Imprinting center abnormalities can be a result of deletions that are familial and inherited. They can also be the result of epimutations (heritable changes in gene expression that do not alter the DNA sequence) that are sporadic and have a low recurrence risk. Sometimes epimutations are postzygotic, resulting in mosaicism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/18,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21-23</a>]. If the methylation studies are negative and suspicion for AS remains, sequencing studies for <em>UBE3A</em> should be obtained.</p><p>Screening and monitoring studies include developmental evaluations and EEG to check for seizures. The EEG is often abnormal; therefore, the author suggests obtaining an EEG after one year of age in all children with AS. Patients should also be evaluated for feeding problems and gastroesophageal reflux. Referrals to physical, occupational, and speech therapy are recommended. Augmentative communication methods may be beneficial. Consider melatonin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> to alleviate severe sleep disturbances.

Mild intellectual disability occurs in two-thirds of cases. Although the exact gene(s) responsible for PWS are still unknown, two reports have identified possible contributory causes. Truncating mutations in the <em>MAGEL2</em> gene that encodes an ubiquitin ligase enhancer involved in endosomal protein recycling were identified in patients with PWS and autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although <em>MAGEL2</em> may contribute to the PWS phenotype, the role of this gene is still unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, deletions of the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) HBII-85 cluster have been reported in PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The clinical manifestations include mild to severe intellectual disabilities, <span class=\"nowrap\">seizures/epilepsy,</span> behavioral abnormalities, autism, schizophrenia, hypotonia, and visual impairment. The region contains six genes, but <em>CHRNA7</em>, a cholinergic receptor gene, appears linked to seizures and the clinical phenotype. Some authors hypothesize that this deletion alone is not sufficient to cause disease and that other abnormalities or modifiers are needed. Several patients whose deletion involves<em> KLF13</em>, a gene located in the critical region, have congenital heart defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Screening and monitoring studies include formal developmental and psychologic evaluations and electroencephalogram (EEG).

The main clinical features associated with this syndrome are sensorineural hearing loss and male infertility due to sperm dysmotility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The disease is autosomal recessive and is caused by haploinsufficiency of <em>CATSPER2</em> and <em>STRC</em>, two genes included in the deleted region that are expressed in the sperm and inner ear, respectively. Males who inherit two <em>CATSPER2-STRC</em> deletions are infertile and deaf [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The core cognitive features of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, including developmental delays and severe speech problems, are largely due to deletion of genes in a 1.1 Mb critical region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The majority of breakpoints lie within segmental duplication (SD) blocks. The region is surrounded by multiple locus control regions (LCRs) that control chromatin structure and amplify expression of linked genes.</p><p>The syndrome is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, digital abnormalities, hypospadias, and connective tissue abnormalities (loose joints) (MIM #613406) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Patients have distinctive dysmorphic features including a receding hairline, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, broad inner aspect of the eyebrows, downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, long smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and a full lower lip. Skeletal findings include delayed bone age, brachydactyly, and broad phalanges with distal hypoplasia. Genital anomalies include hypospadias, micropenis, and a small scrotum. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has been frequently reported in this deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Other, less frequent anomalies can include intestinal atresia, imperforate anus, hearing loss, growth hormone deficiency, cardiovascular anomalies, and meningomyelocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p><em>CYP11A1</em> maps to the region and encodes cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), which converts progesterone to pregnenolone. Deletion of this gene may be responsible for the genital abnormalities in males (complete absence of this gene causes sex reversal in males and congenital adrenal insufficiency). Other deleted genes include a number of enzymes involved in glycosylation (loss of both copies is usually required to exhibit symptoms; thus, this deletion may uncover recessive phenotypes). Other genes potentially responsible for this phenotype includes <em>CPLX3</em>, a regulator of neurotransmitter release that is expressed in the brain and eye, and <em>SEMA7A</em>, a gene that mediates peripheral and central axon growth required during neuronal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Screening and monitoring studies include formal developmental evaluation and skeletal survey to uncover skeletal anomalies. Males may need endocrine evaluations, and other imaging studies should be considered to evaluate for diaphragmatic hernias. Patients may benefit from physical, occupational, and speech therapies. An echocardiogram, hearing evaluation, and ophthalmologic evaluation are other screenings that may be performed at the time of diagnosis. Growth and feeding should be closely monitored.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2157284\"><span class=\"h1\">16p13.3 DELETION SYNDROME (RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A submicroscopic deletion that includes the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein gene, <em>CREBBP</em> or <em>CBP</em>, located on chromosome 16 at p13.3, has been identified in approximately 10 percent of individuals with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS, MIM #180849) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

The thumbs are broad and radially deviated, and the toes are also quite broad and internally deviated. The incisors may have talon cusps. Hirsutism is commonly seen. Congenital heart disease is seen in one-third of patients. Eye abnormalities may include glaucoma, cataracts, and strabismus.</p><p>Mutation of the <em>CBP</em> gene has been detected in approximately 40 percent of affected individuals with RTS.

(See <a href=\"#H8964669\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genomic disorders are diseases that result from the loss or gain of <span class=\"nowrap\">chromosomal/DNA</span> material. The most common and better delineated genomic disorders are divided in two main categories: those resulting from copy number losses (deletion syndromes) and copy number gains (duplication syndromes). (See <a href=\"#H4404803\" class=\"local\">'Overview of genomic disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>15q11-13 deletion syndromes are some of the most common microdeletions. A paternally derived chromosome 15 with this deletion results in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, MIM #176270), whereas a maternally derived chromosome 15 with a similar deletion is associated with Angelman syndrome (AS, MIM #105830). PWS is characterized by hypotonia, poor feeding in infancy with failure to thrive but increased appetite and obesity in children and adults, genital hypoplasia, small hands and feet, and distinctive facial features. AS is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe to profound intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, and a movement or balance disorder, usually in the form of gait ataxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tremulous movement of limbs. Patients also often have seizures and characteristic behaviors. (See <a href=\"#H86261867\" class=\"local\">'15q11-13 maternal deletion syndrome (Angelman syndrome)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8964746\" class=\"local\">'15q11-13 paternal deletion syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>16p11.2 deletion syndrome is one of the most common recurrent genomic disorders associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and autism spectrum disorders. It shows incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Clinical findings include variable levels of intellectual disability with a high incidence of language delay, expressive more so than receptive. (See <a href=\"#H8964781\" class=\"local\">'16p11.2 deletion syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 90 percent of patients with DiGeorge syndrome (MIM #188400) have microdeletions involving chromosome 22q11.2. This syndrome is characterized by abnormalities in the development of the third and fourth branchial arches, resulting in hypoplasia of the thymus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parathyroid gland, conotruncal cardiac defects, and facial dysmorphism. Clinical manifestations may include neonatal hypocalcemia, susceptibility to infection, mild to moderate learning difficulties, as well as a predisposition to autoimmune diseases later in life. Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) has some overlapping features with DiGeorge syndrome, such as conotruncal cardiac defects and facial abnormalities, and is also caused by interstitial deletions of 22q11. (See <a href=\"#H86263283\" class=\"local\">'22q11.2 deletion syndromes (DiGeorge syndrome/velocardiofacial syndrome)'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mitter D, Ullmann R, Muradyan A, et al.
