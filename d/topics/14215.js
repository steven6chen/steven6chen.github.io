The polyomaviruses are highly seroprevalent in humans but only cause clinical disease among immunocompromised patients.</p><p>Multiple human polyomaviruses have been identified. BK virus (BKV) and JC virus are the two most common polyoma viruses associated with human disease and the only two associated with nephropathy (BKVN).</p><p>The major diseases caused by BKV are tubulointerstitial nephritis and ureteral stenosis in renal transplant recipients and hemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant recipients. BKV causes clinical disease of the genitourinary tract due in part to its tropism for genitourinary epithelium. JC virus causes a small proportion of polyomavirus nephropathy (&lt;5 percent) among kidney transplant recipients and is typically associated with a milder clinical course.</p><p>BKVN reportedly occurs in up to 10 percent of kidney allograft recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Overall, the reported incidence of allograft failure ranges from 15 to 50 percent of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Approaches to prevention and management of BKVN in kidney transplant recipients are presented here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder and general overviews of these viruses are discussed separately.

Initially, BKV DNA is detected in the urine, followed by detection in the plasma, and, finally, in the kidney (ie, BKVN) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83389 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of BK virus-induced (polyomavirus-induced) nephropathy in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>BKVN is thus preceded by a period of asymptomatic viruria followed by viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Viruria and viremia may be detected weeks to months before there is a detectable increase in the serum creatinine, suggesting that routine screening and preemptive treatment may be an effective strategy to prevent progression of asymptomatic BKV infection to clinically evident BKVN among transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>We recommend a screening and preemptive strategy rather than a treatment strategy, although comparative trials have not been performed. Evidence suggests that prevention based upon a screening and preemptive strategy is superior to an approach that relies upon therapy of established disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is no uniformly effective antiviral therapy for established BKVN, which is associated with allograft failure in 15 to 50 percent of affected individuals. By comparison, the preemptive discontinuation of the antimetabolite component of the immunosuppressive regimen upon detection of BK viremia prevents progression to BKVN in the majority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>However, since the sensitivity and specificity of the BK-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is institution dependent, a screening and preemptive strategy should <strong>only</strong> be utilized under the supervision of a transplant center familiar with these assays. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of BK virus-induced (polyomavirus-induced) nephropathy in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of a screening and preemptive strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/1,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-13</a>]. This approach was best evaluated in a study from Washington University of 200 patients who were randomly assigned to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and were monitored with PCR of blood and urine to help detect early BK viruria and viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At one year, viruria (defined as &gt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> of urine) and viremia (defined as &gt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> of whole blood) were noted in 35 and 12 percent, respectively. Viruria was highest with <span class=\"nowrap\">tacrolimus/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a></span> (46 percent) and lowest with <span class=\"nowrap\">cyclosporine/mycophenolate</span> (13 percent).</p><p>Upon detection of viremia, but not viruria, the antimetabolite (either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) was discontinued. This resulted in resolution of viremia in 95 percent of patients but without an increased risk of acute allograft rejection, kidney dysfunction, or allograft loss. Clinical evidence of BKVN was <strong>not </strong>observed.</p><p>Five-year follow-up was available on 97 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall five-year patient survival was 91 percent, and graft survival was 84 percent. By five years, there was no difference in overall patient or graft survival among those with BK viruria detected in the first year after transplant compared with those without BK viruria. However, BK viruria during the first year was associated with better death-censored graft survival at five years compared with no viruria during the first year (99 versus 90 percent, respectively). There were no differences in patient survival by immunosuppressive regimen or presence of BK viremia. Immunosuppression and viremia did not influence graft survival. Acute rejection occurred in 12 percent by five years after transplant, was less common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (9 versus 18 percent), and was lowest with the tacrolimus-azathioprine regimen (5 percent).</p><p>These data suggest that BK viruria without viremia poses minimal risk; that the minimization of immunosuppression upon detection of BK viremia is associated with excellent graft survival, low rejection rates, and preserved renal function at five years; and that such an approach may prevent clinically evident BKVN.</p><p>One study suggested that screening for BK viremia reduced, but did not prevent, BKVN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, in this study, patients were screened less frequently than we suggest, at least initially (ie, at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 after transplantation), which may have precluded early detection of viremia and early modification of immunosuppression. In addition, upon detection of viremia, the reduction in immunosuppression was gradual and stepwise and did not include the immediate withdrawal of the antimetabolite, which has been shown in other studies to be safe and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>].</p><p>Studies have shown that BK viremia, even without overt BKVN, is associated with worse graft function on long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This suggests that earlier intervention in the course of BKV infection (ie, at the stage of viruria, before viremia develops) might improve long-term graft outcomes. However, there are no specific interventions for BKV that have been proven to be effective, and this hypothesis needs to be tested in interventional studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the available literature, a reasonable approach is to screen all renal transplant patients as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85939\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85939 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monthly at months 1 to 6 and at months 9, 12, 18, and 24 posttransplant, although not all clinicians screen at 18 and 24 months.

An international, multidisciplinary guideline panel recommended using urine cytology (decoy cells) or PCR-based detection of urine BKV DNA or VP-1 mRNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Since the sensitivity and specificity of the BK-PCR assay is institution dependent, this strategy should <strong>only</strong> be utilized under the supervision of a transplant center familiar with these assays.</p><p>The threshold whole blood PCR value that is considered positive varies among institutions. As an example, at Washington University, whole blood BK-PCR is considered positive when levels are &gt;3200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> whereas, at the University of Maryland, blood BK-PCR is considered positive when the levels are &gt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. Levels &gt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> are quantitatively accurate, clinically significant, and correlate with BKVN. As an example, in one study of 130 recipients who developed BK viremia during the first year after transplantation, BKVN developed only among patients with persistent BK viral loads &gt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Viral loads &lt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> were not associated with BKVN nor with transplant outcomes at one year.</p><p>If whole blood BK-PCR becomes positive, further evaluation and treatment is based upon the serum creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If the serum creatinine concentration is increased compared with baseline values, we perform a kidney biopsy. An allograft biopsy is mandatory in order to confirm a diagnosis of BKVN and to help detect any other pathologic processes, particularly concurrent acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Since specific effective antiviral therapy does not exist, the <strong>cornerstone</strong> of therapy is to decrease immunosuppressive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Additional interventions are based upon the clinical response to these initial maneuvers as measured by the reduction in the BK viremia load after a period of one to two months. The resolution of viremia may take several months. An alternative approach that is used by others is to decrease the mycophenolate dose by 50 percent, followed by a 50 percent decrease in the calcineurin inhibitor at three months if decoy cells persist. If using this approach, the target serum tacrolimus trough level is 4 to 6, and the target serum cyclosporine trough level is 60 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Mycophenolate may be discontinued completely if viremia persists. Maintenance immunosuppression then consists of tacrolimus and low-dose prednisone.</p><p>A similar approach may be used for those who use steroid-free regimens, but centers may feel less inclined to use monotherapy with either a calcineurin inhibitor or antimetabolite. An alternative approach is to reduce both the calcineurin inhibitor and the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, which allows both the targeting of two pathways and lower total immunosuppression.</p><p>However, the initial approach of decreasing immunosuppressive medications is not always effective.

This strategy involves periodic monitoring for BKV replication in urine or blood to start early intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An approach is to screen all renal transplant patients as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85939\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85939 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Monthly at months 1 to 6 and at months 9, 12, 18, and 24 posttransplant, although not all clinicians screen at 18 and 24 months. The approach to screening is based upon the observation that 85 percent of patients who develop BK viremia do so within the first three to four months after transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When renal allograft dysfunction occurs or when an allograft biopsy is performed for allograft dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Screening methods include urine cytology (decoy cells), polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of urine BKV DNA or VP-1 mRNA. Positive tests should be confirmed within four weeks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> followed by one of the following assays using quantitative (realtime) PCR with threshold levels for presumptive disease:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Urine DNA load &gt;10<sup>7</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Urine VP-1 mRNA load &gt;6.5 X 10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/ng</span> total RNA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Plasma DNA load &gt;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If whole blood BK-PCR becomes positive, further evaluation and treatment is based upon the serum creatinine concentration. If the serum creatinine concentration is increased compared with baseline values, we perform a kidney biopsy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the kidney biopsy shows both interstitial inflammation plus BKVN, options for treatment include administering intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and decreasing immunosuppression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the kidney biopsy shows BK nephropathy, we treat with decreased immunosuppression and IVIG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the biopsy does not show evidence of nephropathy, we decrease immunosuppression and continue to monitor blood BK-PCR every two weeks until the assay becomes negative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the serum creatinine concentration is not increased compared with baseline values, we decrease immunosuppression and monitor blood BK-PCR every two weeks until the assay becomes negative. If the serum creatinine concentration increases during the monitoring period, we also perform a kidney biopsy. Subsequent interventions are based upon biopsy results, as previously noted. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cornerstone of treatment of biopsy-verified or a presumptive BKVN is cautious reduction in immunosuppression. For patients who have progressive allograft dysfunction despite a maximal decrease in immunosuppressive therapy for a period of several weeks' to months' duration, we may administer antiviral therapy, although efficacy has not been proven. (See <a href=\"#H497201863\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agents that have been anecdotally used for BKVN include IVIG, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>. None have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of BKVN. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not use fluoroquinolones for prevention or treatment of BKV infection in kidney transplant recipients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have graft failure resulting from BKVN, our approach is to defer retransplantation until BK viremia is resolved. We do not perform nephro-ureterectomy in the absence of BK replication. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Kidney retransplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3013478398\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Emilio Ramos, MD, FACP, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-bk-virus-induced-polyomavirus-induced-nephropathy-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hirsch HH, Brennan DC, Drachenberg CB, et al.
