The solute transport rates are assessed by the rates of their equilibration between the peritoneal capillary blood and dialysate. The ratio of solute concentrations in dialysate and plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P</span> ratio) at specific times (t) during the dwell signifies the extent of solute equilibration. This ratio can be determined for any solute that is transported from the capillary blood to the dialysate. Creatinine, urea, electrolytes, phosphate, and proteins are the commonly tested solutes for clinical use.</p><p>Since glucose is absorbed from the dialysate to blood and very quickly metabolized, a conventional <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> ratio for glucose is meaningless. Instead, the fraction of glucose absorbed from the dialysate at specific times can be determined by the ratio of dialysate glucose concentrations at specific times (t) to the initial level in the dialysis solution <span class=\"nowrap\">(Dt/D0)</span>. The PET also helps measure ultrafiltration (UF) and residual volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>An overview of the PET is presented here. A detailed analysis of the utility of this examination in evaluating patients with less than adequate clearances or UF is presented separately.

The test permits the comparison of multiple results in a patient over a long period of therapy; in addition, the results between patients within a center and between populations from different geographic locations may be compared.</p><p>The PET is standardized for the following elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of preceding exchange prior to the test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflow volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positions during inflow, drain, and dwell</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Durations of inflow and drain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sampling method and processing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory assays</p><p/><p>It is extremely important to adhere to the standard test regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In one study, variations in the performance of the preceding exchange prior to the test, such as utilizing a dry, tidal, or standard exchange, resulted in significantly different results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There are data, however, to suggest that it is not mandatory to have a preceding dwell time of 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Despite these data, we perform a PET after an overnight pre-exchange of 8 to 12 hours dwell time.</p><p>Among individual patients, the PET should always be done using the same dialysate so that longitudinal comparisons are possible. However, the use of conventional versus biocompatible dialysate does not appear to alter the interpretation of results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Although a traditional PET is performed with a 2.5 percent dextrose solution, many programs use only 4.25 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standardized four-hour PET procedure consists of the following sequential steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An overnight 8 to 12 hour pre-exchange is performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the patient is in an upright position, the overnight exchange is drained (drain time not to exceed 25 minutes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two liters of dialysis solution are infused over 10 minutes with the patient in the supine position.

The extensive unabridged test, which was originally proposed by Twardowski et al, has become a very important research tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A simpler and less time-consuming version, called the &quot;fast PET,&quot; exists, but this version is less popular due to several flaws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Peritoneal transport characteristics obtained within the first month of initiating peritoneal dialysis may be relatively inaccurate. This was shown in a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients in whom the results of PETs obtained one and four weeks as well as one year after peritoneal dialysis commencement were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Significant differences were observed between the one- and four-week tests in the measurement of <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> urea, <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> creatinine, and <span class=\"nowrap\">D/Do</span> glucose; by comparison, there was general agreement between the four-week and one-year PET measurements.</p><p>In our program, we perform a PET test approximately one to two weeks after initiation of peritoneal dialysis therapy (which is three to four weeks after catheter insertion) to use as a baseline value. The test is repeated when clinical problems arise and when clinical suspicion of an alteration in membrane transport occurs (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PET has several clinical applications, particularly the classification of peritoneal membrane function and the assessment of inadequate dialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77628 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Another approach to assessing peritoneal membrane status is the Peritoneal Dialysis Capacity (PDC) test, which utilizes the following three parameters:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An area parameter <span class=\"nowrap\">(A0/dX),</span> which is equivalent to the dialysate to plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P)</span> ratio for PET</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>JvR, which is the fluid reabsorption rate after glucose equilibrium is achieved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>JvL, which is the large pore fluid flux</p><p/><p>Although limited data suggest that the PDC test may help categorize the underlying cause of low ultrafiltration (UF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], further study is required to understand the possible role for this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal membrane function classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transport classifications for creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> and glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">D/D0</span> based upon averages, standard deviations, and minimal and maximum values over four hours are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65815\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65815 \">figure 1</a>). Drain volumes correlate positively with dialysate glucose and negatively with <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> creatinine at four-hour dwell times.</p><p>Peritoneal dialysis patients are classified as having one of the following peritoneal membrane function characteristics based upon the results of the PET:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High transporter (or fast transporter) &ndash; Defined as a creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> greater than +1 standard deviation (SD) from the mean or a glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">D/Do</span> of less than -1 SD from the mean</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low transporter (or slow transporter) &ndash; Defined as a creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> of less than -1 SD from the mean or a glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">D/Do</span> of greater than +1 SD from the mean</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average transporter &ndash; Defined as a creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> and a glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">D/Do</span> of between +1 SD and -1 SD around the mean</p><p/><p>In the original series, approximately two-thirds of patients had average transport rates on the baseline PET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The remaining one-third consisted almost equally of high and low transporters. This distribution, however, may not be observed in all patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>There appears to be an association between initial peritoneal transport status and certain clinical features, particularly age. This was best studied in a report of 3188 patients from Australia and New Zealand who initiated peritoneal dialysis between 1991 and 2002 and underwent a baseline PET within the first six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Upon multivariate analysis, a high transporter was associated with increased age (odds ratio [OR] 1.08 for each 10 years, 95% CI 1.03-1.13) and ethnicity (OR 1.48 for Maori and Pacific Islander racial origin, 95% CI 1.13-1.94). By comparison, this finding was not associated with gender, diabetes and other comorbid conditions, smoking, previous hemodialysis therapy or transplantation, or residual renal function. A similar association between increasing age and high-transporter status at dialysis initiation was noted in a second, smaller study from Spain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Almost 90 percent of properly conducted PETs show consistency in both ratios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If there is discrepancy between the creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> and glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">D/D0,</span> the test should be repeated. This discrepancy is often the result of elevated serum glucose levels.

Since PET results and clearances are highly reproducible, a change over time of a transport rate as assessed by an alteration in the <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> ratio should indicate a transport rate change. However, long-term studies on peritoneal membrane function in peritoneal dialysis patients have reported variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. One analysis primarily including ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients has shown that the <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> creatinine ratio is a strong predictor of outcomes (mortality and hospitalization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of membrane injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many patients with acute peritonitis display altered peritoneal membrane function, it is not customary to perform a PET during or after an episode of peritonitis, since acute changes are usually reversible after recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, many patients with acute peritonitis require a change in their dialysis prescriptions due to the increased transport of both large and small solutes and reduced drain volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The change in prescription usually involves increasing the glucose tonicity or shortening the dwell time to obtain improved UF. A discussion concerning the effect of peritonitis on the dialysis prescription can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-transporters-on-maintenance-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid transporters on maintenance peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some severe peritonitis episodes result in irreversible membrane changes due to extensive intra-abdominal adhesions; these adhesions compromise solute and water transport due to reduced membrane fluid contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In this setting, the PET will show a low <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> creatinine ratio and drain volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan with intraperitoneal contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] or by infusion of an intraperitoneal radioisotope and peritoneal scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of causes of inadequate ultrafiltration and solute clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is an overview of the use of PET in assessing the causes of inadequate UF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> solute clearance. A detailed discussion of this subject is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inadequate solute clearance in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Any patient who requires three or more 4.25 percent glucose dialysis solution exchanges to maintain dry weight is considered to have inadequate UF capacity. The diagnostic importance of the PET in determining the causes of inadequate UF is shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78657\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78657 \">algorithm 2</a>). In this algorithm, it is assumed that every peritoneal dialysis patient has had a baseline PET performed at the time of training.</p><p>When a patient complains of fluid retention, the clinician should first ascertain that the drain volume is indeed reduced before performing another PET. Unchanged drain volume with fluid retention is seen with the loss of residual renal function, excessive fluid intake, or noncompliance with the dialysis prescription.</p><p>If the drain volume is verifiably reduced, the clinician should repeat a PET, preferably with 4.25 percent dextrose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78657\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78657 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When PET results are unaltered from the baseline values, UF failure is due to either loss of dialysate outside the peritoneal cavity (excessive lymph absorption or dialysis solution leak into the abdominal wall or thoracic cavities) or failure to drain the dialysate because of catheter malfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When PET results suggest that membrane transport (solute clearance) has increased, bacterial or chemical peritonitis should be suspected. If peritonitis is absent, the constellation of inadequate UF and increased solute clearance is termed <strong>type I membrane failure</strong>; this condition occurs in some patients in whom peritoneal dialysis has been continuous for prolonged periods and, as reported by some studies but not others, in some patients with frequent prior peritonitis episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In type I membrane failure, the inability to generate sufficient UF is gradual and permanent. Patients report using an increasing percentage of hypertonic solutions to maintain dry body weight. Cycler dialysis with short-dwell exchanges may occasionally restore fluid balance. In some, temporary cessation of peritoneal dialysis may transiently restore UF capacity and allow remesotheliazation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In others, however, sclerosing peritonitis (see below) develops after the switch to hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-transporters-on-maintenance-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid transporters on maintenance peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased solute and fluid removal with repeat PET is termed <strong>type II membrane failure</strong>. This condition may be due to severe, recurrent, or smoldering peritonitis, extensive adhesions resulting from previously severe peritonitis, or an extremely rare disorder, sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis (SEP). SEP is a progressive condition, which continues to evolve even after cessation of peritoneal dialysis. Progressive intra-abdominal adhesions may eventually lead to intestinal obstruction and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serial PET studies in proven cases of sclerosing peritonitis suggest that SEP goes through several phases. The initial phase is similar to type I membrane failure (high-transport rates), which then progresses to type II membrane failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. If peritoneal dialysis is discontinued in a timely manner, the initial phase is reversible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inadequate solute clearance in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of early ultrafiltration failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the unabridged PET in normal patients, the sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> curve typically exhibits an initial drop due to the high rate of UF. Because of sodium sieving, the UF is initially low in sodium. As a result, the dialysate sodium concentration is diminished, thereby resulting in a fall in the <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> sodium ratio. With the cessation of UF later during the dwell, dialysate sodium tends to equilibrate with that of capillary blood, thereby returning the <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> sodium to baseline. Absence of the initial drop of <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> sodium is therefore an indication of UF failure, a finding typically observed in the early phase of SEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. UF failure, if present at the time of start of peritoneal dialysis, is due to a disorder of free water transport as well as small-pore UF. Improvement in UF failure in such patients is linked to improvement in small pore-mediated water transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>To best assess UF failure, some recommend that a modified PET be performed, rather than the standard PET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The modified test replaces the 2.5 percent dextrose solution with a 4.25 percent dextrose solution, resulting in a maximal osmotic drive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. With this test, failure is defined as a UF volume of less than 400 mL after a four-hour dwell with 2 liters of 4.25 percent dextrose (3.86 percent glucose).

The ratio of solute concentrations in dialysate and plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P</span> ratio) at specific times (t) during the dwell signifies the extent of solute equilibration. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PET is a highly reproducible procedure consisting of a standardized four-hour dialysis exchange with a dialysis solution. It is standardized for key elements of the procedure. The standardized test for clinical utility measures dialysate creatinine and glucose levels at zero, two, and four hours of dwell and serum levels of creatinine and glucose at any time during the test. We perform a PET approximately one to two weeks after initiation of peritoneal dialysis therapy to use as a baseline value. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Elements of the peritoneal equilibration test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PET has a number of clinical applications. It is principally used to classify peritoneal membrane function and assess the reasons possibly underlying inadequate dialysis or ultrafiltration (UF). To best assess UF failure, some recommend that a modified PET be performed rather than the standard PET. It is not customary to perform a PET during or after an episode of peritonitis, since acute changes are usually reversible after recovery. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical applications'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-equilibration-test/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Pannekeet MM, Imholz AL, Struijk DG, et al.
