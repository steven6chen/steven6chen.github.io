The most common clinical expression is an eczematous dermatitis that can be mild to severe, acute and short lived, or chronic. The management of ACD is based upon the identification of the offending allergen, avoidance of exposure, use of safe alternatives, and treatment of symptoms.</p><p>This topic will discuss the management of ACD.

Providing nickel-sensitive patients with a list of objects that may contain nickel may be helpful. A nickel test kit (eg, Spot Test for Nickel, Delasco) may also be useful for patients to identify nickel-releasing objects at home or at work. These kits, which use dimethylglyoxime, do not harm the object being tested. In one study, the nickel spot test had a sensitivity and specificity of 60 and 98 percent, respectively, in detecting nickel released in amounts &gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/cm<sup>2</sup></span> per week by a set of earrings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is the threshold established by the European Union Nickel Directive for products intended to be in direct and prolonged contact with the skin.</p><p>Since jewelry (including some yellow and white gold jewelry) and metal components of clothing are the most common sources of nickel that are in prolonged contact with the skin, several avoidance measures have been suggested to limit nickel exposure from these sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Coating a nickel object with a physical barrier may prevent the release of nickel ions. The application of a clear barrier (eg, Nickel Guard) or clear nail polish to the buttons and rivets of jeans may prevent nickel release through at least two wash and dry cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an alternative, iron-on patches may be applied on clothes to cover metal parts that come in contact with the skin. Another physical barrier is duct tape. This can adhere to the inside of buttons or snaps, is inexpensive, easy to apply, and widely available.</p><p>Chemical barriers for nickel include chelating and nonchelating barrier creams. Barrier creams containing agents such as disodium ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA) act by chelating the positive ionic charge and rendering the metal inactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Multilayer laminate gloves, which incorporate a <span class=\"nowrap\">hydrophilic/polar</span> layer between two <span class=\"nowrap\">hydrophobic/nonpolar</span> layers, usually provide a high level of protection against a wide range of chemicals.

The substitution of milder detergents for abrasive or irritating cleansers and the application of allergen-free emollients (eg, petrolatum-based emollients) after each hand washing may reduce the risk of hand dermatitis at the workplace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The regular application of emollients to normal skin after repeated exposure to irritants may help to maintain the skin barrier function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H6233164\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education about avoidance of offending substances and recommendations for alternative, allergen-free products are a critical part of the management of patients with ACD. (See <a href=\"#H6508906\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest medium- or low-potency (groups five and six (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) topical corticosteroids for mild to moderate ACD of the face and flexural areas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice daily for one to two weeks. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are an alternative. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are applied twice daily until resolution. (See <a href=\"#H23871208\" class=\"local\">'ACD involving the face or flexural areas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest high-potency (group one to three (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) topical corticosteroids for treatment of ACD that involves &lt;20 percent of the body surface area, does not involve the face or flexural areas, and is not disabling (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice daily for two to four weeks, or until resolution of symptoms. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H23871295\" class=\"local\">'ACD involving the hands, feet, or nonflexural areas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest systemic rather than topical corticosteroids for: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute and extensive ACD involving the face if topical corticosteroids are ineffective or if quick relief is desired (eg, for eyelid involvement) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ACD that involves &gt;20 percent of the body surface area (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ACD that involves &lt;20 percent of the body surface area and is disabling or has not responded to treatment with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment is started with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or equivalent dose of other systemic corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64138 \">table 2</a>)) at a dose of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum 60 mg per day) per day for seven days. The dose may be reduced by 50 percent in the next five to seven days and then tapered and discontinued over the following two weeks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phototherapy and systemic immunosuppressive medications are therapeutic options in patients with chronic ACD that is unresponsive to topical or oral corticosteroids. Narrowband UVB is more convenient for the patient and associated with fewer side effects than PUVA. (See <a href=\"#H1039422426\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest intermittent high-potency (group one to three (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) topical corticosteroids rather than emollients alone for long-term control of chronic ACD involving the hands, feet, or nonflexural areas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The topical steroid is applied once daily three times per week on alternate days. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be helpful in chronic localized ACD that is not responsive to topical corticosteroids or that is induced by topical corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H1039422539\" class=\"local\">'Chronic ACD'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bikowski JB.
