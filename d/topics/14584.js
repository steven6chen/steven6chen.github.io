Among hospitalized patients with cancer, the prevalence of pain is from 62 to 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although it has been suggested that adequate pain relief can be achieved in 70 to 90 percent of patients when well-accepted treatment guidelines for cancer pain are followed, the availability of effective therapy has not eliminated the problem of undertreatment. A systematic review concluded that among patients with advanced cancer, pain levels are reported as moderate to severe in about 40 to 50 percent, and very severe or excruciating in 25 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids&quot;, section on 'The problem of undertreatment'</a>.)</p><p>Pain affects the psychological, cognitive, social, and spiritual domains of patients' lives; in turn, the experience of pain can be influenced by emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual factors. The burden of pain is manifested not only through suffering, but also through impaired function, decreased activity, and alterations in one&rsquo;s sense of identity and social role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Uncontrolled or poorly relieved cancer pain has a profoundly negative impact on quality of life, and it increases suffering for caregivers as well. </p><p>Thus, the adverse effects of cancer pain are complex and highly individual. In some cases, patients suffer from mood effects (anxiety or depression), or from inability to do their jobs, hobbies, or other functions because of uncontrolled pain. In other cases, it is the meaning attributed to pain which drives suffering. The common assumption that pain is an indicator of progressive illness can cause increased fear and emotional distress for patients and caregivers alike. &#160;</p><p>Pain and its associated outcomes may be ameliorated by a diverse array of interventions. Opioid-based pharmacotherapy is a mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe pain in patients with active cancer. In appropriate patients, nonpharmacologic strategies may provide satisfactory pain relief with fewer drug side effects, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> better outcomes with regard to physical and psychosocial functioning, and some patients prefer to try nonpharmacologic approaches first. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids&quot;, section on 'General principles of pain management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Nonpharmacologic therapies for cancer pain include primary treatments for the etiology of the pain (eg, radiotherapy), invasive symptomatic therapies (eg, nerve blocks), and noninvasive symptomatic therapies.

(See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713245\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the past 20 years, psychological approaches have increasingly become part of a comprehensive approach to pain management. This has been prompted by the recognition of the ongoing interplay of physical and psychological variables in the perception and management of pain. As pain is a multidimensional experience, not only is it affected by cognitive and psychological variables but, in turn, it does affect patients&rsquo; cognition and their psychological response. Even when there are clear physiological mechanisms underpinning and sustaining pain, as in the case of patients with cancer, minimizing its impact on mood and overall emotional well-being can improve patients&rsquo; quality of life. This section on psychological approaches will focus on cognitive behavioral therapy, because it is the modality that has received support in randomized trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44713404\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer pain is significantly affected by psychological factors and an individual&rsquo;s cognitive style. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches to management of cancer pain can effectively improve coping, self-efficacy, and a sense of control over the pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A number of well-conducted randomized trials support the utility of CBT interventions for cancer-related pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The majority of these interventions were initially developed for patients with chronic, non-malignant pain and subsequently applied to the treatment of patients with cancer. Thus, CBT is generally considered a potentially effective adjunct for the treatment of chronic cancer-related pain.</p><p>The success of these approaches in the management of cancer pain provides support for the well-accepted view that pain affects psychological functioning, that psychological functioning affects pain and pain-related distress, and that neither pain nor suffering should ever be considered solely the result of nociception (the activation of neural mechanisms that subserve the perception of pain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Individual response to pain can be mediated by the meaning that is attributed to the pain sensation, past experience, levels of anxiety and depression, and other psychological factors. Addressing thoughts and emotions related to the experience of pain may help relieve stress, anxiety, and other mood disturbances associated with pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44713411\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When delivered to patients with cancer, CBT typically focuses on maintaining quality of life through improved self-efficacy, developing a sense of control over the illness and its consequences, and learning self-regulation skills to improve emotional functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Additionally, cognitive-behavioral techniques are focused on reducing the impact of pain on the performance of normal daily activities by addressing patients&rsquo; and caregivers' interpretation of and emotional reactions to pain and illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>According to the cognitive-behavioral model, an individual&rsquo;s interpretation of external events and bodily sensations directly affects his or her emotional reactions to these events and subsequent behavior. Every cognitive behavioral approach starts by identifying and modifying unhelpful thinking patterns that are believed to increase distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Dichotomous thinking, catastrophization, and overgeneralization, among others, are considered dysfunctional cognitive patterns because they typically arise from limited information and do not accurately reflect reality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62075 \">table 1</a>). &#160;</p><p>The goal of CBT is to present the patient with a reality-based alternative version or interpretation of events, in order to elicit a more adaptive emotional response and improved coping. As an example, a patient with early stage cancer who is experiencing pain may interpret the situation as hopeless, focusing on interpreting the pain as a sign that the illness is progressing, that death is a likely outcome, and there is nothing that can be done. The result of this thought process may be significant emotional distress, and an increase in anxiety, depression, and overall suffering. A cognitive-behavioral intervention would encourage the patient to explore additional meanings of the pain that might allow for a greater sense of control. Additionally, it would also encourage the patient to consider relevant pain management treatment options and improve communication with the treating team. &#160; &#160;</p><p>CBT engages patients in setting specific goals and monitoring results. The process includes patient education, behavioral skill training, and cognitive skill training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education is typically provided in the first session. Patients receive a detailed explanation of the rationale for the treatment approach, and they are taught to recognize the relationship between how they think, how they feel, and how they behave. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral skill training focuses on teaching patients practical skills that aid coping and adaptation to the illness. For example, patients are taught simple relaxation techniques that they can utilize in stressful or anxiety-provoking situations. They may be taught to pace their activities to reduce fatigue or frustration, which may also help related mood disturbances. They may learn to incorporate pleasurable activities and experiences in their daily lives (pleasant activity scheduling).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive skill training focuses on teaching patients how to identify and modify patterns of maladaptive thinking, and how to replace them with more adaptive ones (cognitive restructuring). As part of cognitive skill training, patients are encouraged to examine whether, in the process of trying to make sense of the cancer or the pain, there may be errors in their thinking or mistaken beliefs.</p><p/><p>The following case example illustrates the potential benefits to be gained from CBT. A patient with advanced ovarian cancer is experiencing persistent neuropathic pain in the upper and lower extremities as a result of chemotherapy. Although her medication regimen was successfully controlling her baseline pain, she still had regular episodes of breakthrough pain which were highly distressing. When invited by her daughter to go on a cruise with other family members, she refused because of pain. Through cognitive-behavioral therapy, the patient acknowledged that she interpreted flares of breakthrough pain as harbingers of progressive disease and imminent death. She also said that she would never be able to have a normal life again and did not deserve to incorporate pleasant experiences in her life. She concluded that she should not plan anything as extravagant as a cruise and that, if she went, her pain and negative mood would burden her family. In her mind, a cruise evoked images of happiness, health, fun, and youth, and because her thoughts and beliefs convinced her that this overarching joy was out of reach, she decided to avoid the experience altogether. When she communicated her decision to her family, she experienced a significant increase in pain. &#160;</p><p>Her CBT focused on the reality of her medical condition rather than her interpretations. Although the disease was advanced, her oncologist was clear that there was no rapid progression, and although her prognosis was limited, death was not near, and pain did not foretell its imminence. It was true that fatigue and pain could limit her ability to engage in all activities during the cruise, her mood was often poor, and that the stress of planning the trip, traveling, and meeting others in a new environment and social context might increase anxiety and thereby raise the likelihood of pain. However, her avoidance of the trip was largely the result of incorrect, distorted, or maladaptive thinking. She had concluded that life was essentially over, that she was a burden to her family, and could no longer hope for satisfying and pleasurable activities, pursuits, or goals. </p><p>The therapist's first task was to help the patient identify her problematic thoughts and beliefs, critically examine their value and veracity, and assist her in restructuring her thinking to consider all the possibilities and choices that are available. Within several sessions, the patient was able to accomplish this, and decided to accept the trip with her family. The trip became a special memory for the family after the patient's death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351172382\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While numerous studies have investigated the role of CBT in the treatment of mood disturbances in patients with cancer, few have considered cancer-related pain as the outcome variable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two well-designed randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] demonstrated that behavioral skill training could reduce cancer-related pain during a short follow-up period of six months. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of randomized trials examining CBT for distress and pain in breast cancer patients, which included two randomized trials in which pain was an outcome measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], concluded that patients who were administered cognitive behavioral techniques had significantly less distress and pain compared to those in control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of the available literature by the NIH Technology Assessment Panel on Integration of Behavioral and Relaxation Approaches for the Treatment of Chronic Pain and Insomnia found only moderate evidence for the effectiveness of CBT for relief of chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two other trials of CBT to reduce treatment-related pain (mainly from mucositis) in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation failed to show a benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials of psychotherapy, CBT, and some mind-body interventions (relaxation, hypnosis, desensitization with imagery or biofeedback, meditation) in 4199 cancer patients in whom pain was measured as an outcome, the mean effect size for pain severity, the primary outcome, was 0.34 (95% CI 0.23-0.460), and for pain interference, it was 0.40 (95% CI 0.21 TO 0.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p>Taken together, these data support the utility of CBT and mind-body interventions as a component of multimodality treatment of cancer-related pain.

Interventions include therapeutic exercise, usually initiated or guided by a physical therapist; hydrotherapy, which may be particularly helpful in the medically ill; orthoses, ambulation aids, and other devices; and &ldquo;physical modalities&rdquo; such as the application of heat and cold, vibration, ultrasound, electrical stimuli (eg, as with a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS] device), and therapy for lymphedema. Therapeutic massage is discussed in a separate section. (See <a href=\"#H44713523\" class=\"local\">'Manual interventions'</a> below.) &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44713460\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic exercise (physical therapy) involves the systematic implementation of planned physical movements, postures, or activities designed to ameliorate impairment, improve function, and enhance overall wellbeing. Manual stretching, myofascial therapy, passive mobilization, and active exercises are some of the modalities utilized within this approach. </p><p>Patients with a musculoskeletal basis to their pain may be able to achieve better symptom control and potentially better function through focused physical therapy that specifically targets the painful region. Improved pain and wellbeing may also result indirectly, presumably due to the physiologic benefits associated with conditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exercise-induced increases in the endogenous endorphins and enkephalins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Some other benefits of therapeutic exercise include favorable effects on blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], promotion of muscle strength and flexibility, and improvement in aerobic capacity and hormonal adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A systematic review of 18 randomized studies that investigated various applications of physical therapy on impaired range of motion and pain of the upper limb after breast cancer treatment demonstrated the effectiveness of physical therapy for improving postoperative pain and range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Therapists and physiatrists must work with oncologists to confirm the safety and appropriateness of exercise, and clarify the medical status of the patient and the specific targets and goals of care. Therapeutic exercise can be a time-limited intervention that may ameliorate symptoms and improve function after disease-modifying therapy, such as surgery or chemotherapy, or, in patients with advanced illness, to reduce symptom distress and improve self-efficacy and quality of life. The type, frequency, and duration of exercise is always informed by the performance status of the patient and the overall goals of care. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676924897\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrotherapy is an approach used in disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and fibromyalgia, which are characterized by severe pain and impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Although never systematically studied in patients with cancer-related pain, hydrotherapy may be of benefit for selected cancer patients after consultation between the physiatrist and the oncologist. Hydrotherapy involves the submersion of a small or large body surface area, usually in a small tank or tub. The water temperature usually does not exceed 40&deg; C, but it can be adjusted depending on the condition being treated and the desired effect.</p><p>Hydrotherapy provides a reduced-gravity environment that facilitates benefit from physical therapy because of the effect of buoyancy and decreased stress on joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Additionally, hydrotherapy facilitates muscle relaxation and improves overall emotional state. Patients may experience a decrease in the typical pain experienced with movement, and this may enhance both physical and psychological outcomes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44713467\"><span class=\"h2\">Orthoses and other devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examples of orthoses include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immobilizers of the shoulder and arm for a painful brachial plexopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corsets for persistent pain after treatment for vertebral metastases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrist or ankle splints for distal extremity weakness or pain related to neuropathy. </p><p/><p>Patients with pain on movement may benefit from a splint that is designed to limit those motions that incite the pain. In the cancer population, and particularly in the setting of advanced illness, the use of an orthosis may be preferable to other interventions, such as physical therapy, that attempt to improve function. A return to full function may not be possible, or it may not be the primary treatment goal. Evaluation by an occupational therapist, with input by the oncologist, can clarify the availability and cost of various options. </p><p>Stump pain may be ameliorated by a well-fitting prosthesis, an ambulation aid may reduce pain exacerbation with walking, and devices designed to facilitate specific functions such as toileting or eating can have analgesic consequences or reduce the risk of secondary painful complications related to immobility. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44713474\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic application of heat or cold, ultrasound, and electrical nerve stimulation to focal sites of pain that are unrelated to cancer (eg, sprains) is widely accepted. However, there have been very few studies evaluating short-term efficacy, long-term effectiveness, and safety of these physical modalities in populations with cancer pain, and the evidence in other populations is extremely limited. </p><p>Physical modalities may be especially useful as adjuncts for mild to moderate pain and while awaiting the effect of a breakthrough analgesic. They are never adequate alone for managing moderate or severe cancer pain. There are no comparative data to guide suggestions concerning the selection of specific modalities when used as adjunctive treatment for pain, and the choice of technique is empirical. Based on inference and concern about adverse cutaneous effects, guidelines often suggest avoiding the topical application of these stimuli to areas with reduced sensation and those that are directly superficial to tumor masses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23390067\"><span class=\"h3\">Cold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold application with ice packs, malleable chemical gel packs, and vapocoolant sprays may reduce muscle spasm, inflammation, and edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. The mechanism of action is an initial vasoconstriction, followed by vasodilation. Despite widespread use, there are no controlled studies of cold-induced analgesia for cancer pain. Application of cold should be avoided in ischemic and irradiated tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23390074\"><span class=\"h3\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various superficial and deep heating methods have been applied to control pain and are popular among cancer pain patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/40,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,44</a>].

Given the lack of certainly about the stimulation parameters most likely to help in an individual patient, a serious trial of TENS requires many days and should explore various sites and timing of stimulation, as well as a variety of stimulation parameters (amplitude, frequency, and pattern). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624905594\"><span class=\"h3\">Scrambler therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scrambler therapy is a novel and noninvasive approach developed for the management of pain. It is delivered through an electrocutaneous nerve stimulation device (Calmare) by applying EKG-like pads bilaterally on the skin, above and below the site of pain. Unlike the TENS unit, scrambler therapy does not deliver the stimulation directly to the painful area. The nerve stimulation device is designed to &ldquo;scramble&rdquo; afferent pain signals and replace them with non-painful stimuli.</p><p>Scrambler therapy has been evaluated in small trials involving patients with chronic non-cancer neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>] and patients with refractory chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Available studies are mostly based on case studies and prospective studies that include only a small number of participants, thus limiting ability to draw conclusions about effectiveness. Additional, larger studies with this device are warranted. However, the available data indicate that scrambler therapy may represent a safe alternative to opioid escalation and procedural pain interventions, eg, nerve blocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Factors associated with positive treatment outcome are primarily the presence of neuropathic or mixed neuropathic-nociceptive pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The use of scrambler therapy for patients with chemotherapy induced painful peripheral neuropathy is presented elsewhere.

Rigorous physical therapy protocols for lymphedema include specific education focused on skin care and avoidance of trauma, manual lymph drainage, intermittent pneumatic compression, compression bandaging, and exercises. If the girth in the affected limb can be reduced, patients usually experience a decline in uncomfortable heaviness or stretch, and in secondary myofascial pains. Although these approaches are most often used for extremity lymphedema, they also benefit lymphedema in other sites including the head and neck. As an example, a retrospective study of 32 patients with head and neck cancer who received physical therapy (lymphatic drainage, massage, compression therapy, facial, tongue, and neck exercises) and patient education for lymphedema showed significant improvement in face and neck lymphedema and pain after an average of 23.9 sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44713488\"><span class=\"h1\">INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Integrative therapy may be viewed as a care model in which conventional medical approaches are combined with any of a large number of so-called complementary treatments. This strategy is explicitly intended to pursue a holistic course that includes specific objectives (eg, pain control and management of other distressing symptoms) with a broader goal to improve overall quality of life. These approaches are becoming increasingly popular among patients with cancer worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Use of integrative therapies is especially prevalent among women with breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>The National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] suggests the following broad categories of integrative treatments: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative medical systems, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, homeopathy, and naturopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mind-body interventions, such as meditation, hypnosis, dance, music and art therapy, prayer, and mental healing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biological-based therapies, such as herbal therapies, specialized diet therapies, orthomolecular nutrition, and individual biological therapies </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manipulative and body-based methods, such as massage and chiropractic </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Energy therapies, such as biofield and bioelectromagnetic-based therapies &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p>Integrative (complementary) therapies for which there is evidence of benefit in cancer patients include meditation, hypnosis, relaxation therapy, imagery music therapy, and possibly acupuncture. There are increasing, but still limited data on the effectiveness of massage therapy and biofield therapies such as Reiki, therapeutic touch, and healing touch, and these complementary treatments cannot be recommended with the same confidence. Nevertheless, there is little, if any harm from these approaches. If practitioners are available, and the cost is affordable, there is no reason to discourage patients with cancer pain from trying these interventions.</p><p>Several terms related to integrative therapy are used interchangeably, which can create confusion for practitioners. It is essential to distinguish between complementary, alternative, and integrative <strong>therapies</strong>, and complementary, alternative, and integrative <strong>medicine</strong> (CAM): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Complementary medicine&rdquo; refers to the provision of a complementary therapy <strong>in conjunction with</strong> conventional medical treatment. For example, a patient with cancer who is undergoing disease-modifying treatment could also receive massage, music therapy, yoga, and hypnosis to improve symptoms, coping, and overall wellbeing in the context of cancer treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer&quot;, section on 'Complementary supportive care'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Alternative medicine&rdquo; refers to the use of a complementary therapy <strong>in place of</strong> conventional medicine. This would be the case if a patient diagnosed with cancer decided to refuse surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy and relied on herbal treatment or homeopathy as the sole treatments for the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer&quot;, section on 'Alternative cancer treatments'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integrative medicine refers to the coordinated use of conventional medical care with complementary therapies. In this context, the treatments are generally coordinated by the patient&rsquo;s treating team.</p><p/><p>Integrative therapy programs are evolving in the United States and are still in a nascent stage. In contrast, many specific complementary and alternative treatments are very widely used by cancer patients (although their use is often not disclosed to physicians). There is particular interest in the use of alternative therapies as antitumor therapy, and efforts to evaluate such treatments within the framework of conventional medical evidence are ongoing. However, rigorous study of these treatments in appropriately designed randomized trials is extremely important to avoid the potential for negative outcomes from the use of treatments that promise to extend life but are without merit, particularly if patients choose these treatments in lieu of conventional medical therapy. Other complementary and alternative therapies have the potential for harm in the setting of cancer pain, (eg, spinal manipulation in the setting of bone pain from metastatic disease, the use of herbal remedies with unknown ingredients, or herbal remedies that directly interact with other therapies such as chemotherapy), and the physician should strongly recommend against these. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer&quot;, section on 'Safety issues with complementary and alternative treatments'</a>.) &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624903946\"><span class=\"h2\">Mind-body therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cancer pain may benefit from one or more of a group of therapies that share a common perspective: emphasizing the potential value of training the &ldquo;mind&rdquo; (by shifting cognitions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> creating a desirable emotional state) in a way that favorably influences bodily functions. These therapies are usually considered as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, as a component of a broader approach that includes cognitive behavioral therapy or other unrelated noninvasive therapies. However, occasionally, mind-body therapies are offered alone as specific treatments for a single discrete problem (eg, pain related to a specific procedure). All of these treatments are intended to reduce pain and anxiety, and increase self-efficacy. They usually require a competent health professional to provide the training, but some, such as relaxation training based on slow and mindful breathing, may be taught by a knowledgeable primary care provider. Patients who benefit can continue the approach over a long period, often with no additional support, or only an occasional session of retraining. </p><p>Some mind-body therapies should be considered mainstream rather than CAM therapies; these include relaxation therapy, imagery, hypnosis, and biofeedback. These approaches are well-accepted adjunctive approaches that benefit many patients with chronic pain, including pain related to cancer. </p><p>Other mind-body therapies, such as meditation or prayer, are usually categorized as CAM. Although music therapy is sometimes considered a CAM therapy, its growing evidence base and widespread acceptance suggests that it, too, would be better classified as a conventional treatment with wide potential use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer&quot;, section on 'Complementary supportive care'</a>.) </p><p>Although many small trials support benefit from several of these therapies, two systematic reviews in 2006 and 2008 concluded that while hypnosis, imagery, acupuncture, and healing touch seemed promising for adjunctive treatment of oncology patients with pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] or oncology patients in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], particularly in the short-term, the evidence was not conclusive as to benefit because of the paucity of methodologically rigorous trials. </p><p>A 2014 clinical practice guideline on the use of integrative therapies in patients after breast cancer treatment from the Society for Integrative Oncology rated the strength of available evidence for each integrative modality based upon a modified version of the recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Healing touch, music therapy, hypnosis, and acupuncture each received a grade of &ldquo;C&rdquo; (weak evidence of benefit) for treating, respectively, pain during chemotherapy, pain from cancer surgery, and musculoskeletal pain associated with aromatase-inhibitors. The authors concluded that these modalities could be offered or recommended to selected patients based on the understanding that they may bring a small benefit. Of note, music therapy, meditation, and yoga received higher grades for the evidence-based treatment of anxiety and stress, as well as depression and mood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624903993\"><span class=\"h3\">Relaxation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relaxation techniques share two components: the repetitive focus on a word, sound, prayer, phrase, body sensation, or muscular activity; and the adoption of a passive attitude towards intrusive thoughts. &#160;</p><p>As a group, relaxation techniques attempt to induce a so-called relaxation response characterized by decreased arousal and diminished sympathetic activity (eg, decreased heart rate and lower blood pressure). This is accompanied by increased electroencephalographic slow wave activity. When used therapeutically, relaxation techniques may be subdivided into two methods, deep and brief, or by the specific strategy used to induce the relaxed state, including progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, and breath training. The data are currently insufficient to conclude that one technique is more effective than another for any given condition. </p><p>There is a small chance of adverse reactions during relaxation training. In a survey of 116 clinicians who conducted relaxation practice with 17,542 patients, the most common adverse reactions were intrusive thoughts, fear of losing control, upsetting sensory experiences, muscle cramps, sexual arousal, and psychotic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>Adverse reactions to relaxation practice have also been described as relaxation-induced anxiety or relaxation-induced panic. Relaxation-induced anxiety is described as a gradual increase in behavioral, physiologic, and psychological anxiety, whereas relaxation-induced panic is severe anxiety of rapid onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Patients with a history of generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder and those with a history of hyperventilation are more likely to experience these adverse effects. Although the risk is small, patients with these histories should be carefully monitored during the relaxation process. &#160;</p><p>Patients should also be introduced to deep breathing techniques that often accompany relaxation in a gradual manner. Until a relaxation technique is mastered by the patient under supervision from a clinician, patients with risk factors (eg, anxiety disorders) should be discouraged from practicing deep breathing on their own for more than a couple of minutes at a time. </p><p>A benefit for relaxation has been shown in several small randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/26,30,68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30,68-70</a>], but in some cases, the benefits have been transient. In a trial of 59 patients with cancer pain requiring opioid therapy who were randomly assigned to one of three active cognitive behavioral treatments (distraction, positive mood, or relaxation interventions) or to a control, patients in the relaxation and distraction groups reported significantly decreased pain intensity immediately after intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. However, at two weeks after enrollment, no differences were apparent between any of the treatment groups. </p><p>An early systematic review concluded that relaxation techniques were effective in reducing chronic pain in a variety of medical conditions, including cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, a later systematic literature review concluded that low methodologic quality and small sample size limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the available literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624904155\"><span class=\"h3\">Imagery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imagery utilizes recall of pleasant sights, smells, sounds, tastes, or somatic sensations (touch, movements, or positions) to create a positive cognitive and emotional state that can prevent or ameliorate pain or other sources of distress. The use of imagery for the treatment of human ailments began thousands of years ago. In the Asclepian temples of Greece, imagery was evoked in a state of consciousness that occurred in the lucid period just before sleep, which is now described as hypnogogic sleep. Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen were trained in this method of imagery and used it regularly with their patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. </p><p>Guided imagery practitioners use words to create states of focused attention that are thought to alter the experience of pain. This technique may have multiple applications, including pain management. Other coping techniques, such as distraction, mental dissociation, muscle relaxation, and controlled abdominal breathing, are also practiced as part of guided imagery.</p><p>There is no evidence that links specific types of imagery with positive outcomes in specific physiological systems (eg, immune or cardiac). Clinical imagery procedures include diagnostic imagery, mental rehearsal imagery, and end-state imagery. Once developed with the therapist, the latter two types of representations can be retained by patients as discrete memories that can be accessed as needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic imagery provides the information needed to design individualized and meaningful imagery sessions for each patient. Patients are asked to describe their pain in personally detailed sensory and emotional terms, and this information is then used to design individualized mental rehearsal or other therapeutic interventions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental rehearsal imagery is a technique that is often used to prepare patients for painful treatments or surgical procedures (eg, biopsies). It is primarily used to relieve anxiety, pain, and side effects that are exacerbated by a heightened emotional reaction. Typically, a relaxation strategy is taught to the patients, who are then led through a &ldquo;guided imagery trip&rdquo; from the treatment through the recovery period. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During mental rehearsal imagery, it is important to be factual, to avoid emotionally-charged or fear-provoking words, and to reframe the medical procedure in realistic yet positive terms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End-state imagery is a technique intended to produce a specific physiologic or biological change in the body. Its clearest objective is to reduce sympathetic nervous system arousal. End-state imagery has been successfully used to alleviate chemotherapy-induced nausea and to assist in the control of cancer pain. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">End state imagery for the treatment of pain is called analgesic imagery; it is either pain-transforming or pain-incompatible. Pain-transforming imagery concentrates on changing specific aspects of the pain experience, such as the contextual aspect of the painful experience (eg, imagining that the moment the chemotherapy needle touches the skin and before it is inserted, it releases a massive amount of powerful analgesic medication that completely numbs the arm). Pain incompatible-imagery can be used to evoke positive emotions and feelings of relaxation, excitement, or peace that are not compatible with the image of pain. </p><p/><p>Guided imagery can be directive, as when the therapist suggests images to the patient, who then uses them as a sort of hook to develop further a personalized imagery. Or, it can be more interactive, as when the therapist does not provide the patient with a specific image, but only suggests generally the feeling that should be elicited by the image, allowing the patient to create an image that corresponds to or is able to evoke the desired emotional state. </p><p>Most guided imagery treatment plans begin by assisting the patient in the mental creation of a physical place where he or she feels comfortable, cared for, and peaceful. The therapist may gently invite the patient to &ldquo;allow an image to form, of a place where you feel peaceful, comfortable, and cared for&rdquo;. Use of words such as &ldquo;safe, protected&rdquo; are best avoided with patients with a history of trauma, because they may indirectly function as reminders of the traumatic experience and may, therefore, increase the general level of arousal and cause anxiety.</p><p>Published outcomes from research on mental rehearsal imagery are almost uniformly positive, reporting significant reductions in pain and anxiety, length of postoperative hospital stay, pain medication use, and fewer treatment-related side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/30,64,69,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,64,69,72,73</a>].

Major components of the hypnotic state include absorption (capacity to contemplate deeply a selected theme or focal point), controlled alteration of one's attention, dissociation (the capacity to compartmentalize different aspects of an individual experience) and suggestibility (the capacity for heightened responsiveness to instructions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. Hypnotic analgesia has been increasingly utilized for chronic and acute pain conditions and is increasingly accepted for both acute and procedure-related pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Patients vary widely in their ability to achieve a hypnotic state. Typically, individuals have been classified as &ldquo;high hypnotizables&rdquo; or &ldquo;low hypnotizables&rdquo;, as assessed by validated instruments such as the Penn State Scale of Hypnotizability (PSSH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>] or the Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale (SHCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Cooperation and suggestibility are important foundations for hypnotizability. The trait of suggestibility alone, however, does not determine the potential for hypnotic induction. Suggestibility also does not determine whether or not a hypnotic trance can be achieved and does not imply that any particular outcomes will be achieved. To allay concerns, some patients need reassurance that hypnosis cannot induce behaviors that would not be desired or are contrary to the patient's values.</p><p>Hypnosis can promote relaxation, decrease anxiety, and increase pain threshold. It may alter the perception of pain by decreasing the unpleasantness of the sensation, or reducing the attention paid to the painful sensation and refocusing attention elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/65,81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,81-83</a>]. Hypnosis can help patients experience less emotional upset and anxiety when they undergo stressful surgical procedures, such as excisional breast biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. </p><p>Several randomized controlled studies have shown the effectiveness of hypnosis in reducing pain and anxiety related to invasive procedures performed in cancer diagnosis and treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is sparse but promising evidence for the effectiveness of hypnosis in breast cancer care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Three randomized trials have found modest beneficial effects on pain and distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]. In the largest of these, 125 women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to hypnosis plus supportive-expressive therapy or to use of self-directed educational material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Over 12 months, intervention resulted in significantly less of an increase in the intensity of pain and suffering compared with the education-only group, but there were no significant effects on the frequency of pain episodes or the amount of constant pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Three randomized trials also support benefit in women undergoing diagnostic breast biopsy or lumpectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>]. In the largest of these, a randomized trial of 200 women undergoing breast cancer surgery demonstrated that a 15-minute presurgery hypnosis session was superior to attention control (nondirected empathic listening) at reducing pain, nausea, fatigue, discomfort, emotional upset at discharge, and institutional costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a controlled study of 67 patients undergoing bone marrow transplant, hypnosis was significantly better than therapist support or cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing reported oral pain from mucositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the published literature performed by the NIH Technology Assessment Panel concluded that there was strong evidence to support benefit from hypnosis in management of chronic cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; however, a later, more rigorous systematic review concluded that low methodologic quality and small sample size limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the available literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p/><p>The mechanisms responsible for hypnotic phenomena are not entirely clear; research in breast cancer surgical patients suggests that the benefits are mediated by altered response expectancies (ie, specific expectations for nonvolitional events such as the occurrence of pain and fatigue after an operation) and diminished emotional distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3312244\"><span class=\"h3\">Biofeedback</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biofeedback involves the use of a machine to allow monitoring and feedback control over a specific physiological parameter.

By monitoring the stimulus and learning to control the physiological response that generates it, biofeedback can facilitate healthier cognitive and behavioral response patterns to pain and stress. It can help patients learn to modify the internal, subjective experience by providing corrective information to either validate the strategy that is being used to achieve a desired state (eg, relaxation) or show its inadequacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>The physiological responses that are most commonly used for biofeedback are respiration, heart rate or pulse, peripheral skin temperature, electrical skin conductance, and muscle tension (surface electromyography [EMG]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Surface EMG biofeedback, for example, has been used for the treatment of cancer-related pain by targeting muscle groups associated with the patient's response to pain; relaxing these muscles can also help induce a general relaxation response, which can further alter pain perception or reduce anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Biofeedback might be considered for any motivated patient with pain or distress, if the resource exists and patients have the ability to participate. Patients with chronic or recurrent depression may respond negatively to stress reduction approaches that tend to decrease the patient's already low level of arousal. Additionally, clinicians must be aware that coffee, nicotine, steroids, and sedatives can be problematic, because they may alter reading of measure, thus obfuscating results. </p><p>The value of surface EMG biofeedback was shown in a small trial in which 37 patients with advanced cancer and chronic pain were randomly assigned to EMG biofeedback-assisted relaxation (six sessions over four weeks) or conventional care only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. The main endpoint was pain, as assessed at baseline and following the intervention using a version of the Brief Pain inventory (BPI). In an analysis of the 24 patients who completed the study (12 experimental, 12 control), relaxation training supplemented with biofeedback was effective in reducing cancer&ndash;related pain, whereas in the control group, pain increased. </p><p>Additional studies are needed to replicate this result and compare this approach to other types of biofeedback. The NIH Technology Assessment Panel and a later meta-analysis both concluded that there was only moderate evidence to support benefit from any form of biofeedback in the management of chronic cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/28,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44713502\"><span class=\"h3\">Meditation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although religious forms of meditation have been practiced for thousands of years, meditation has only recently received significant research attention as a medical intervention in Western culture.

Reiki is often classified as a form of energy healing; it can reduce stress and induce a relaxation response, which may be therapeutic in a manner similar to mind-body interventions. As an example, a study of 30 HIV patients suffering from an array of disease-related symptoms who were trained to practice first degree Reiki healing reported reductions in pain and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].

In some cases, patients suffer from anxiety or depression, or from their inability to do their jobs, hobbies, or other functions because of uncontrolled pain. In other cases, it is the meaning that is attributed to pain (eg, that it implies progression of malignant disease) that drives suffering. Given the multidimensional nature of pain, a diverse array of interventions may provide benefit. (See <a href=\"#H44713397\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a broad consensus that patients with moderate to severe chronic cancer pain should receive opioid-based pharmacotherapy. Outcomes related to the pain, and to pain-related impairment of mood and function may be enhanced by the adjunctive use of non-invasive psychological, rehabilitative, and integrative therapies. Such nonpharmacologic strategies may provide satisfactory pain relief with fewer drug side effects, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> better outcomes with regard to physical and psychosocial functioning. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from randomized trials and meta-analyses support the utility of psychosocial interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy as a component of multimodality treatment of cancer related pain.

There are only limited data on the effectiveness of massage therapy and biofield therapies such as Reiki, therapeutic touch, and healing touch, and these complementary treatments cannot be recommended with the same confidence as other integrative therapies. Nevertheless, there is little, if any harm from these approaches. If practitioners are available, and the cost is affordable, there is no reason to discourage patients with cancer pain from trying these interventions. Clinicians should be aware of these strategies, know which are available in the community, and consider referral when patients may be able to benefit.
