For many patients, some degree of pain persists, and some patients develop moderate to severe pain that can be disabling or interfere with sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. A presumptive diagnosis of post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia can be made when pain persists for more than three months following hernia repair, and is not related to other causes. </p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of persistent pain following hernia repair and surgical treatment of post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia will be reviewed here. The general issues surrounding hernia repair, including measures for preventing post-herniorrhaphy pain, are discussed elsewhere.

These nerves arise from the lumbar plexus and provide cutaneous sensory innervation for the groin, upper hip, and thigh regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76701\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76701 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves travel along the anterior surface of the quadratus lumborum, and the genitofemoral nerve runs along the anterior surface of the psoas major muscle before piercing the abdominal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79068%7EOBGYN%2F63993\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79068 graphicRef63993 \">figure 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ilioinguinal nerve emerges lateral to the internal ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 3</a>) traveling toward the external ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The anterior branch of the iliohypogastric nerve is located more medially between the external oblique aponeurosis and the underlying internal oblique muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve exits the retroperitoneum at the internal inguinal ring to run through the inguinal canal on the anterior surface of the spermatic cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 3</a>). The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is less commonly injured, but may be exposed by dividing the inguinal ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79068 \">figure 2A</a>) and the lateral fibers of internal oblique aponeurosis.</p><p/><p>The iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and genital branch of the genitofemoral nerves are encountered during anterior, open hernia repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 3</a>).

During laparoscopic repair, the ilioinguinal nerve is at risk lateral to the internal ring and the genitofemoral nerve medial to the ring.

Up to half of patients report some degree of residual groin pain at one year of follow-up, but up to 15 percent complain of moderate to severe and possibly disabling pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/1,2,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15-20</a>]. In a survey of 2500 Swedish patients two to three years after primary surgery for groin hernia, 30 percent reported some residual groin pain, and 11 to 14 percent reported that the pain was severe enough to interfere with activities (sitting, walking) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A prospective study that included 781 elective primary open hernia repairs found that persistent pain to any degree occurred in 16.5 and 16.1 percent of patients at six months and five years, respectively, after hernia repair; however, moderate to severe pain was present in only 1.2 and 1.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Retrospective reviews have identified the following risk factors for persistent pain following groin hernia surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3,15,20-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15,20-27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of preoperative pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interval less than three years from a prior surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe early postoperative pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative complications </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative sensory disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliohypogastric nerve excision during hernia repair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent hernia repair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior hernia repair</p><p/><p>Younger patients may be more likely to develop chronic post-hernia pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A survey of 351 patients who underwent inguinal hernia surgery identified age as the strongest risk factor for developing persistent pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The incidence of persistent pain was 58 percent for those less than 40 years of age, but 14 percent for those over 60. Physical activity and type of employment were speculated to play a role in this difference. </p><p>Preoperative pain or chronic pain near the surgical site predisposes to the development of chronic neuropathic pain following hernia surgery. This phenomenon has also been described following amputation, breast surgery, thoracotomy, and in patients with herpes zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23,24</a>]. In a prospective study that included 781 elective primary hernia repairs, significantly more patients with preoperative pain experienced chronic groin pain at six months and five years postoperatively compared with those who did not (22 and 21 percent versus, 13 and 14 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Higher levels of acute postoperative pain also predict persistent pain weeks to months after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25,26</a>]. Complications such as recurrent hernia, postoperative hematoma, and infection may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>The frequency of persistent postoperative pain may be higher following open hernia repair, particularly with an anterior approach, compared with laparoscopic hernia repair (ie, posterior approach) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a survey of 1603 patients, persistent pain at one-year and five-year follow-up was reported by 7.3 and 8.4 percent of patients after open hernia repair and by 5.0 and 6.6 percent after laparoscopic repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Sensitivity to nociceptive pain differs from one patient to another and may be related to an inherited susceptibility to the generation and experience of pain, as well as response to analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women may also be more predisposed to a higher level of postoperative pain compared with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Psychological and stress-related factors such as depression and anxiety may also contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2618515\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two distinct mechanisms can result in a perception of pain following surgery. Acute pain is predominantly due to nociceptive and inflammatory stimulation, which lessen over a predictable time interval (typically six to eight weeks). By contrast, chronic neuropathic pain is due to abnormal neural activity and can persist without ongoing inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, if post-herniorrhaphy groin pain persists for more than eight weeks, it is most likely neuropathic in nature and can be due to primary or secondary nerve injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/1,3,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,31</a>].</p><p>Primary nerve injuries occur at the time of the hernia surgery, and may be caused by [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete or partial transection of nerves, which can lead to neuroma formation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve damage related to manipulation (stretching, crushing, cautery injury)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Entrapment or impalement of nerves by sutures or staples</p><p/><p>Secondary nerve injury following hernia repair results from an inflammatory process adjacent to the nerve, which is most commonly incited by a mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. When a peripheral nerve comes into contact with a polypropylene mesh, degeneration of the myelin sheath and associated edema and fibrosis can cause nerve damage. This process has been demonstrated in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>], but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, wadding of the mesh, or &quot;meshoma,&quot; can lead to nerve entrapment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Wadding of the mesh is generally caused by a lack of adequate mesh fixation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an oversized mesh that is too large to stay flat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27790690\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although mesh placement is commonly performed in inguinal herniorrhaphy, mesh fixation techniques vary and have been exploited to prevent or reduce postoperative groin pain with differing results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of absorbable sutures to secure a mesh has been associated with a lower rate and shorter duration of postoperative groin pain, compared with nonabsorbable sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of fibrin glue (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">Tisseel/Tissucol),</span> rather than suture or tack, to secure a mesh has been shown to reduce postoperative pain in patients who undergo both open and laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/39-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of cyanoacrylate glue (Histoacryl) to secure a mesh did <strong>not</strong> reduce postoperative pain in patients who underwent open inguinal hernia repairs with the Lichtenstein technique in one randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] but reduced short-term pain up to 30 days compared with suture repair in another trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In the second trial, there were no differences between the groups in terms of complications, chronic pain, and recurrences at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of a self-gripping mesh (Progrip) did <strong>not</strong> reduce the risk of chronic pain compared with a standard mesh secured with sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/46,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48,49</a>].</p><p/><p>Routine identification and preservation of all inguinal nerves crossing the operative field during open groin hernia repair has been the standard practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Some authors, however, have advocated routine prophylactic neurectomy to prevent post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia. They argue that inguinal nerves may be damaged during and after open herniorrhaphy from inflammation, entrapment, or contact with mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Additionally, preexisting inguinal neuritis may also contribute to post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ilioinguinal nerve is the most commonly identified inguinal nerve during open hernia repair. In a meta-analysis of 11 randomized small trials, 1031 patients underwent open Lichtenstein repair with or without prophylactic ilioinguinal neurectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Compared with nerve preservation, prophylactic neurectomy resulted in significant reductions in the number of patients reporting pain at &lt;3 months (relative risk 0.61, 95% CI 0.4-0.93) and 3 to 12 months (relative risk 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.46), and a trend towards fewer patients reporting pain at &gt;12 months (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.25-1.01). Neither sensory changes (eg, numbness) in body areas innervated by the nerve nor surgical complications differed between the two groups. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The iliohypogastric nerve was the second most commonly identified inguinal nerve during open hernia repair. In the same meta-analysis (three trials involving iliohypogastric neurectomy), 270 patients underwent open Lichtenstein repair with or without prophylactic iliohypogastric neurectomy. Fewer patients reported pain (relative risk 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.90) after a prophylactic iliohypogastric neurectomy at &lt;3 months. Patients who had prophylactic iliohypogastric neurectomy did not have increased sensory changes or complications.</p><p/><p>Although routine prophylactic neurectomy during groin hernia repair is safe and may reduce the incidence of post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia, it may lead to troublesome sensory changes such as numbness or dysesthesia in some patients. Thus, the choice of groin nerve preservation versus sacrifice should be made individually for each patient after careful discussion of potential outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5007263\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2018168339\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be asked about the onset and quality of the pain, pattern of radiation and nature of their pain, and whether any activities or medical therapies have improved the pain or made the pain worse. The history should also include the type of surgery (open or laparoscopic), type of hernia (medial [direct], lateral [indirect], femoral), and whether there were any postoperative complications. In addition, any history of preoperative pain should be sought, including pain related to other prior surgical procedures, particularly if less than three years have elapsed prior to the hernia surgery. Men should be asked about pain related to sexual activity, which is reported in up to 7 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/27,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,53</a>].

Some patients have only mild pain postoperatively or become pain-free, only to develop new-onset pain several weeks, months, or even years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/23,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,54</a>]. In a prospective study that included 781 elective primary hernia repairs, late onset pain developed following an asymptomatic interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the cohort of patients who were pain-free preoperatively, 70 percent of those with pain after five years did not have symptoms after six months. Some patients will report recurrent or worsened pain due to the development of resistance to analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2018168475\"><span class=\"h2\">Features suggesting neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory pain following surgery tends to subside over an expected time course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Features of inflammatory pain that are rarely present in patients with neuropathic pain include a throbbing quality to the pain, and heat hyperalgesia. Inflammatory pain is not associated with sensory or motor deficits. </p><p>Clinical features consistent with neuropathy include an episodic, burning, stabbing, or pricking pain sensation with a trigger point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3,32,34,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32,34,55</a>].

Touching the wound site, breathing, coughing, and bowel activity can also trigger pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pain may radiate to the hemiscrotum, upper leg, or back.

A small number of patients also report numbness over the groin or thigh. </p><p>Clinical signs of neuropathy are distributed along the sensory pathway of the affected nerve(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82895\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82895 \">table 1</a>) but differentiation of the specific nerve that is the source of pain can be difficult because of the overlap of the sensory innervation in the groin and the presence of scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Pain may be reproduced (triggered) by tapping the skin medial to the anterior superior iliac spine or over an area of local tenderness.

Groin nerve blocks are performed to control pain and confirm the diagnosis (since nerve block should relieve the pain of neuralgia).

During a nerve block, a mixture of a long-acting local anesthetic and a glucocorticoid is injected into the tissue surrounding the affected nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. As an example, one such protocol calls for injection of 5 to 10 mL of 0.25% to 0.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, combined with 25 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> or 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>.

In others, pain recurs after the effect of treatment wears off in a few days. Patients with a positive response to an initial nerve block can be treated with weekly injections until pain relief becomes sustained. For those who fail to achieve a sustained response to repeated nerve blocks, groin nerve sacrifice may be their best option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28344437\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who initially respond to nerve blocks but pain recurs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Response to a nerve block, even a transient one, indicates that the pain is neuropathic in origin.

As an example, ilioinguinal neurectomy alone has been used as an effective treatment for relieving neuropathic groin pain in patients who are diagnosed with ilioinguinal neuralgia by selective nerve blocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/57,77,80,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,77,80,87</a>].

In another study, 21 of 23 patients stopped taking pain medications after undergoing a successful ilioinguinal neurectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In other studies, although a selective neurectomy avoids the chronic sensory deficit of triple neurectomy, it may not be as effective as a triple neurectomy in relieving chronic pain.

Mesh can contribute to postoperative groin pain by causing inflammation or entrapping nerves. On occasion, mesh removal by itself may be effective to relieve groin pain. As an example, a patient with testicular pain and a previous plug-and-patch repair was found to have the mesh engulfing the vas deferens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Removal of the mesh plug along with the vas resulted in complete pain relief. However, removal of hernia mesh alone generally does not lead to lasting pain relief in patients with post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia, and better pain relief can be achieved with mesh removal plus neurectomy compared with mesh removal alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Mesh removal can predispose patients to developing recurrent hernias.

Although some degree of groin pain following hernia repair is common, up to 10 percent of patients develop moderate-to-severe pain following hernia repair. For some, the pain can be persistent and disabling, and may also interfere with sexual function. (See <a href=\"#H30661114\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute postoperative pain following groin hernia surgery is common and, usually, easily treated with opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Neuropathic pain is due to injury to a nerve or to the elements responsible for nerve transmission. The nerves most commonly implicated in post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia are the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, genitofemoral, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. Nerve injury can be primary or secondary to an adjacent inflammatory process such as a close association of the nerve with hernia mesh. (See <a href=\"#H337154369\" class=\"local\">'Nerves of the groin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2618515\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for chronic groin pain following hernia repair include younger age, female gender, postoperative complications (eg, hematoma, infection), recurrent hernia repair, open repair techniques, history of preoperative pain, and an interval of less than three years from a previous surgery.

The clinical triad of burning near an incision or region of dissection radiating along a specific nerve distribution, evidence of impaired sensory perception in the distribution of that nerve, and pain that is relieved by peripheral nerve block strongly support a diagnosis of post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia. Imaging studies (computed tomography or magnetic resonance) are used primarily to exclude nonneuropathic hernia-related pathologies or other non-hernia-related diseases in the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107683\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107683 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Triple neurectomy, which is the combined resection of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerves, permanently relieves chronic groin pain in the majority of patients (up to 95 percent), but with a loss of inguinal sensation.
