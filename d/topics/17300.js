It is caused by a fungus.</p><p>Tinea nigra is most common in areas where the weather is hot and humid. People whose hands or feet sweat a lot are more likely to get it. This is because the fungus that causes tinea nigra grows best in warm, wet places.</p><p>Tinea nigra is not &quot;contagious.&quot; That means it does not usually spread from one person to another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29546776\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of tinea nigra?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is tan, brown, or black patches on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111461\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111461 \">picture 1</a>). These are most common on certain body parts, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palm or back of the hand &ndash; This usually happens in just one hand.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bottom of the foot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arms or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest, back, or belly</p><p/><p>The brown or black patches might look darker around the edges. They do not usually itch, hurt, or cause any other symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29546791\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinea nigra is not dangerous. But a type of skin cancer called &quot;melanoma&quot; can also cause brown or black spots on the skin. If you get a new brown or black spot on your skin, ask your doctor or nurse to check it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29546806\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for tinea nigra?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. After learning about your symptoms and doing an exam, your doctor or nurse will probably scrape one of the brown or black patches. Then he or she will look at the scrapings under a microscope. This test does not usually hurt.</p><p>If you have tinea nigra, the doctor or nurse will see the fungus that causes it in the scrapings from your skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29546821\"><span class=\"h1\">How is tinea nigra treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The doctor or nurse can prescribe a cream or ointment to put on your skin. This usually makes tinea nigra go away.</p><p>If the cream or ointment does not work, the doctor or nurse can prescribe medicine you take by mouth. This medicine kills the fungus that causes tinea nigra.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29546836\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinea-versicolor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tinea versicolor (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=melanoma-skin-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Melanoma skin cancer (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
