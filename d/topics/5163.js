For most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, SCC has predominated. In the 1960s, SCC accounted for more than 90 percent of all esophageal tumors in the United States, and adenocarcinomas were considered so uncommon that some authorities questioned their existence. However, over time, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (predominantly arising in the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction) has increased dramatically in Western countries such that adenocarcinoma now accounts for &gt;60 percent of all esophageal cancers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, worldwide, SCC still predominates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Esophageal SCCs and adenocarcinomas differ in a number of features, including tumor location and predisposing factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78167\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78167 \">table 1</a>). Smoking and alcohol are major risk factors for SCC, while Barrett's esophagus with intestinal metaplasia (a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]), obesity, and smoking are the risk factors for adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although there seems to be little doubt that esophageal SCCs and adenocarcinomas represent two different diseases with characteristic pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology, and outcomes, whether and how histology should influence the therapeutic approach remains controversial.

This poor long-term outcome has prompted evaluation of neoadjuvant (preoperative) combined modality approaches, which have evolved in parallel for thoracic esophagus and EGJ tumors, respectively. For most patients with T3 or node-positive tumors, neoadjuvant therapy is generally preferred over initial surgery.

Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss from esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer is common and may result in iron deficiency anemia. Early intramucosal adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus that are recognized at endoscopy in an area of Barrett's esophagus are not specifically symptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1065232198\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracic esophageal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arising in the thoracic esophagus have similar clinical presentations despite the fact that adenocarcinomas arise much more commonly in the distal <span class=\"nowrap\">esophagus/EGJ</span>.</p><p>In contemporary series, approximately 6 to 10 percent are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most early (superficial) esophageal cancers in the United States are detected serendipitously or during screening for or surveillance of Barrett's esophagus. Early intramucosal cancers are not specifically symptomatic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of superficial esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients with advanced disease are symptomatic, most often with dysphagia and weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3458742637\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysphagia and weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, obstruction of the esophagus by the tumor causes progressive dysphagia, often accompanied by weight loss. Dysphagia usually occurs once the esophageal lumen diameter is less than 13 mm, which indicates advanced disease. Weight loss is due to changes in diet to accommodate the dysphagia, and tumor-related anorexia may contribute. Approximately 20 percent of patients experience odynophagia (painful swallowing). </p><p>Early symptoms of esophageal cancer may be subtle and nonspecific. Transient &quot;sticking&quot; of apples, meat, hard-boiled eggs, or bread, which can be easily overcome by the patient with careful chewing, may precede frank dysphagia. Patients may also notice retrosternal discomfort or a burning sensation. The dysphagia gradually progresses from solids to liquids. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1254708276\"><span class=\"h4\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of dysphagia is broad and includes nonmalignant strictures, achalasia and other esophageal motility disorders, esophagitis, and esophageal webs and rings.

Aspiration pneumonia is infrequent. Hoarseness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cough may occur if the recurrent laryngeal nerve is invaded by either the primary tumor or associated nodal metastases.</p><p>Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss from esophageal and EGJ cancer is common and may result in iron deficiency anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, patients seldom notice melena, hematemesis, or blood in regurgitated food. Similarly, acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is rare and is a result of tumor erosion into the aorta or pulmonary or bronchial arteries.</p><p>Tracheobronchial fistulas are a late complication of esophageal cancer. The fistulas are caused by direct invasion through the esophageal wall and into the mainstem bronchus. Such patients often present with intractable coughing or frequent pneumonias. Life expectancy is less than four weeks following the development of this complication. </p><p>Patients may present with signs or symptoms referable to distant metastatic disease. The most common sites of distant metastases in patients with esophageal cancer are the liver, lungs, bone, and adrenal glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Adenocarcinomas most frequently metastasize to intraabdominal sites (liver, peritoneum), while metastases from SCCs are usually intrathoracic. However, many other sites are described, including cutaneous, muscle, and brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1262037624\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical esophageal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 5 and 6 percent of esophageal cancers arise in the cervical portion of the esophagus, which is 6 to 8 cm long and extends from the hypopharynx to the thoracic inlet (suprasternal notch) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111260\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111260 \">figure 1</a>). Most patients have locally advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, sometimes with extension to the hypopharynx. In retrospective series, the most common complaints are weight loss and dysphagia, and 11 to 24 percent have hoarseness as a presenting symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of esophageal cancer requires a histologic examination of tumor tissue.

Advanced lesions appear as strictures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55542 \">picture 2</a>), ulcerated masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78958\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78958 \">picture 3</a>), circumferential masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67522\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67522 \">picture 4</a>), or large ulcerations. Although often considered clinically unimportant, a study of 209 esophageal cancer patients suggests that the length of an esophageal tumor may be an important independent indicator of prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

As an example, in a series of 202 consecutive patients, 47 of whom had gastric or esophageal carcinoma, the percentages of correct diagnoses of esophageal carcinoma were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First biopsy &ndash; 93 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four biopsies &ndash; 95 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seven biopsies &ndash; 98 percent</p><p/><p>The addition of brush cytology specimens to seven biopsies further increased the accuracy to 100 percent. </p><p>For small lesions, endoscopic resection of the entire lesion may be feasible.

For patients with a thoracic esophageal tumor at or above the carina, bronchoscopy is indicated. For cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), flexible laryngoscopy to assess local disease spread and exclude a synchronous malignancy of the head and neck is generally recommended.

In contrast, EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ. Thus, regardless of histology, all esophageal tumors arising in the cervical, thoracic, or abdominal esophagus and those involving the EGJ that have an epicenter within 2 cm of the EGJ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111351 \">table 4</a>) share the same criteria for T, N, and M stage designation. However, there are separate stage groupings for SCC and adenocarcinoma, regardless of site, and stage groupings also differ according to whether the patient has been treated prior to surgery (the yp designation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>Histology-specific stage groupings for adenocarcinoma and SCC, which were initially introduced in 2010, were based on an analysis of worldwide data on 4627 patients with cancer of the esophagus or EGJ who underwent surgery alone; among patients with node-negative tumors, prognosis was dependent on not only T stage but also histology and grade of differentiation, and for SCCs, tumor location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The accuracy of M staging with laparoscopic ultrasound was better than with laparoscopy alone or CT (89 versus 44 and 64 percent, respectively). No randomized trials or large reviews have been performed to determine if laparoscopic ultrasound offers a significant advantage over laparoscopy alone for detecting unresectable disease in esophageal cancer.

Early intramucosal adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus that are recognized at endoscopy in an area of Barrett's esophagus are not specifically symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H369508343\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of esophageal or esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer is usually established by endoscopic biopsy. Early cancers may appear as superficial plaques, nodules, or ulcerations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55091\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55091 \">picture 1</a>). Advanced lesions may appear as strictures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55542 \">picture 2</a>), ulcerated masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78958\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78958 \">picture 3</a>), circumferential masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67522\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67522 \">picture 4</a>), or large ulcerations. The endoscopic appearance of a large mucosal mass is frequently diagnostic of esophageal cancer. Biopsies confirm the diagnosis in more than 90 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68324\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68324 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63363\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63363 \">picture 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) for esophageal cancer is used universally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 5</a>). In the most recent (eighth edition, 2017) version, tumors involving the EGJ with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as esophageal cancers. In contrast, EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111351 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'TNM staging criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of esophageal cancer is established, pretreatment staging includes an evaluation for locoregional disease extent and an evaluation for distant metastases:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the preferred method for locoregional staging. Preoperative bronchoscopy with biopsy and brush cytology is indicated for patients with locally advanced, nonmetastatic tumors that are located at or above the level of the carina, and flexible laryngoscopy is generally recommended for cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Locoregional staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The evaluation for distant metastases may include contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest, and abdomen, whole-body integrated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT,</span> EUS, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diagnostic laparoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> scans are more sensitive than contrast-enhanced CT for detecting metastatic disease and are now widely used for detecting occult metastases if metastases are not seen on the initial staging CT scans. At some institutions, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is carried out with intravenous contrast, and this might effectively replace the need for a separate contrast-enhanced CT, but this practice is not widespread. Suspicious <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> findings should be confirmed before excluding a patient from surgical consideration. (See <a href=\"#H3265018875\" class=\"local\">'CT, PET, and integrated PET/CT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can provide a tissue diagnosis for liver metastases or malignant ascites. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The role of staging laparoscopy is controversial. We reserve diagnostic laparoscopy for patients with potentially resectable clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/T4</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52078\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52078 \">table 3</a>) adenocarcinomas arising within the abdominal portion of the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111351 \">table 4</a>) or if there is suspicion for intraperitoneal metastatic disease that cannot otherwise be confirmed.
