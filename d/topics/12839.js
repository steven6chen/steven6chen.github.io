In most cases, patients in the ICU die after life-sustaining treatments are withdrawn or withheld [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

It can be initiated and administered concurrently with restorative, life-prolonging therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. End-of-life care is a subset of palliative care that describes treatment during the circumscribed period of time when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer indicated or effective and patients are in their final hours, days, or weeks of life. </p><p>Regardless of where a particular patient is in their disease trajectory, palliative care aims to provide patients facing serious illness and their families with the best possible quality of life, whether or not they die from this episode of illness. The primary tenets of palliative care are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom management</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elucidation of the patient's goals of care that are in keeping with their personal values and preferences</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all those involved in his or her care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support both to patients and their family caregivers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordination across sites of care </p><p/><p>Further discussion on the benefits, services, and models for palliative care are discussed separately.

In the ICU, a transition to comfort measures only typically occurs after a patient intentionally foregoes or does not improve with life-sustaining treatments, or when life-sustaining treatment is felt to be medically inappropriate or futile. Usually, at the time someone is considered a candidate for comfort measures only because the underlying disease process cannot be cured or stabilized. For these patients, efforts should be made to minimize invasive and uncomfortable interventions, and care should be redirected toward the management of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethics-in-the-intensive-care-unit-responding-to-requests-for-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In some institutions, the term &quot;comfort care&quot; is used instead of &quot;comfort measures only.&quot; However, in our opinion, &quot;comfort care&quot; can be confused with care focused on sustaining life or curing disease that is <strong>simultaneously</strong> aimed at managing a patient's symptoms. Therefore, we prefer the term &quot;comfort measures only&quot; when all available interventions are aimed exclusively on symptom management and quality of life. We acknowledge the term &quot;comfort measures only&quot; may be upsetting for some patients or family members who may not accept this approach. However, the clarity of the term has advantages over the less clear &quot;comfort care.&quot; Each of these terms are also subject to variable definition and interpretation by patients, families, and providers, so thoughtful exploration and discussion around a plan of care beyond these broad phrases and terms is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3360231113\"><span class=\"h1\">ICU ADMISSION FOR PALLIATIVE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utilization of ICU services for palliative care purposes depends on the institution's guidelines for intensive care and the patient's goals. While a relatively intensive level of care might be possible on inpatient units at some institutions (including those with units specifically intended for palliative care patients), other institutions may only be able to provide these services in the context of an ICU.

In the consultative model, palliative care specialists provide services directly to critically ill patients, but are not part of the primary care team.

Therefore, all patients in the ICU are provided with palliative care, not only those with only the poorest prognosis or with unmet palliative care needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed model &ndash; In the mixed model, both consultative and integrative approaches are used simultaneously.</p><p/><p>A 2011 systematic review evaluating interventions to improve communication in the ICU included studies involving palliative care consultants (as in the consultative model) as well as palliative care provided by critical care clinicians (as in the integrative model). This review found that several factors were associated with reduced family distress, improved family comprehension of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, and decreased utilization of intensive treatments at the end of life. These factors included access to palliative care consultants, provision of printed information, and regular, structured communication by the critical care team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A randomized trial of palliative care-led family meetings to discuss prognosis with family members of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation found no significant improvement in family members&rsquo; symptoms of anxiety and depression and a possible worsening in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder associated with the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Importantly, the palliative care specialists did not perform a palliative care consultation and only led one or two family meetings, often without the ICU clinicians present. This study suggests that interventions to integrate specialty palliative care into the ICU must coordinate this care with the ICU team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1249131\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite data suggesting that access to palliative care services enhances quality of care in the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], palliative care is underutilized in the ICU setting at some institutions.

One study of over 47,000 Canadian immigrants reported that compared with long-standing residents, recent immigrants (&lt;30 years) were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (25 versus 19 percent), die in the ICU (16 versus 10 percent), and receive more aggressive measures of care including mechanical ventilation (22 versus 13 percent), dialysis (6 versus 3 percent), feeding tube placement (6 versus 3 percent), and tracheostomy (2 versus 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Rates of ICU death varied among different nationalities but were greatest in Southern Asians and lowest in Western and Northern Europeans. Mortality risk was greatest in those who had immigrated most recently (&lt;2 years). The analysis did not adjust for race, ethnicity, and English-speaking ability. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms for this association, but underlying causes may relate to communication barriers, challenges in health literacy, and cultural differences in preferences for end-of-life care.</p><p>Interventions to increase palliative care provision in the ICU have been evaluated, including pre-rounds between the ICU and palliative care team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and proactive identification of patients at high risk of dying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, further work is needed to ensure access to palliative care in the ICU given that a high proportion of ICU patients (approximately one in seven) meet triggers for palliative care consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15482338\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMUNICATION ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the sensitive nature of issues related to palliative care, it is important that clinicians have a clear assessment of the patient and his or her ability to participate in conversations, particularly if goals of care are being discussed.

However, these conversations may be difficult or even impossible when a patient is acutely decompensating. Still, an anticipated or recommended admission to the ICU is an important opportunity to talk with patients about their hopes, fears, values, and goals at the end of life. Discussions should encompass the potential benefits and burdens of aggressive ICU-level of care as well as alternatives including care focused primarily on symptom management.</p><p>For patients admitted to the ICU who have not completed advance care planning, these discussions should occur early in an ICU stay and often using the framework of the &quot;time-limited trial&quot; of intensive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Capacity can be established by bedside clinicians and does not require legal or psychiatric evaluation or intervention. However, capacity should not be presumed to be static across decisions of varying complexity or over time. For example, a patient may have the capacity to make one decision, but lack capacity to make a more complex decision. Assessment of decisional capacity in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging and time-consuming, but it is extremely important. Barriers may include intubation, sedation, delirium, or the presence of hearing impairment in the patient.

In one study, up to two-thirds of those who died in the hospital entered the ICU without advance directives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, contemporary studies suggest that in the community, advance directives are more common with utilization rates of 70 percent and above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/31,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even if they have an advanced directive, patients with a serious life threatening illness often face challenging treatment choices that may not be covered by their advanced directive, and high-quality discussions about what is important to them promote good decision-making and patient-centered care. Understanding the patient's values, preferences, and care goals in the context of a serious illness allows the clinician to align the care provided with what is most important to the patient. Discussing goals of care is a unique skill that should be separated conceptually from talking about prognosis or delivering bad news. While discussions about goals of care may involve some of the same principles as other difficult communication tasks, these discussions demand a different framework.

In the absence of a designated guardian or durable power of attorney for health care (DPOAHC or healthcare proxy), clinicians rely on the legally defined &quot;next-of-kin&quot; to assist with medical decision-making. It is important that the physician identify the legal next-of-kin, rather than making the assumption that bedside caregivers are legal surrogate decision makers. </p><p>The order of priority for specific family members varies somewhat by state and country. Of note, unless DPOAHC designation is given in an advance directive, committed partners (particularly those in same sex domestic partnerships and those who live in states where same-sex marriage is not legal or recognized) may not necessarily be given &quot;spousal&quot; rights as a surrogate decision maker. In the United States, this varies by state with some recognizing domestic partnerships, others recognizing same sex marriage, and others recognizing neither. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Legal aspects in palliative and end of life care in the United States&quot;, section on 'Surrogate decision makers'</a>.) </p><p>Surrogate medical decision-making for a critically ill patient is associated with high rates of anxiety and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In one study, 82 percent of family members of critically ill patients who were asked to participate in medical decision-making demonstrated symptoms of post-traumatic stress 90 days after patient discharge or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The task may be complicated by the surrogate's unfamiliarity with the medical environment (including the rapid pace of events that can occur in the ICU) and with complex medical decision-making processes in general, both of which can add to the challenge of functioning as a surrogate decision-maker. Studies suggest that the involvement of palliative care can mitigate this stress upon surrogates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Guidelines have been issued by the American Thoracic Society on shared decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] and the details regarding the value of shared decisions while holding a family meeting in the ICU are provided separately.

This suggests that families may be positively influenced by having more time to come to terms with medical decisions and with their own feelings of grief and loss. One way to ensure that families have more time is to begin to address these issues early in the ICU stay. Additionally, family satisfaction with decision-making can be increased through exploration of patients' wishes, direct recommendations by clinicians to withdraw life support, when appropriate, and attention to families' spiritual needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

These are discussed below.

Multifaceted quality improvement interventions which include interprofessional education and outreach, training of local champions, and coordination across institutions providing ICU-level care have been shown to improve process measures specific to palliative care in the ICU, including, but not limited to: identification of surrogate decision makers, attention to code status and advance directives, assessment of symptoms, and completion of multidisciplinary meetings with patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surrogate decision makers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3835700\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom assessment in the ICU</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms in the critical care setting include pain, dyspnea, and thirst, as well as sleep disturbance and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. As long as patients are able to self report, numeric rating scales (0 to 10) for pain, dyspnea, and thirst are appropriate in the ICU (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93604 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. For patients with a limited ability to communicate (eg, due to intubation), the clinician may use simple &quot;yes or no&quot; questions or use other cues such as facial expressions (eg, grimacing) or vital signs as well as the response to therapy to assess the presence and severity of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/52,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,57,58</a>]. However, symptom assessment in patients who are unable to communicate presents a particular challenge to clinicians in the ICU. When patients are unable to report their symptoms, validated tools, such as the Behavioral Pain Scale, the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool, and the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale can be used for objective assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/57,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,59-61</a>]. However, such tools should be interpreted carefully as they are an indirect representation of the patients' perception. Although preliminary data suggest surrogates (eg, family members, nurses, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other clinicians) may be used as proxy reporters, further study is required to evaluate their influence on outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181371750\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom management in the ICU</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Managing pain, dyspnea, and thirst in the ICU is similar to that in non-ICU patients.

In addition, ethics and palliative care consultation can reduce family distress, improve understanding of medical information, and decrease the use of intensive treatments in the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15482376\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most patients express a preference to die at home when asked, logistical and medical issues in critically ill patients frequently preclude this from happening. Therefore, increasing attention is focused on end of life care in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. (See <a href=\"#H15482308\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care is appropriate for any patient with serious illness. (See <a href=\"#H15482315\" class=\"local\">'Relationship of palliative care to end-of-life care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phrase &quot;comfort measures only&quot; refers to a philosophy of care focused exclusively on the treatment of symptoms, and is reserved for patients with life-limiting illness who elect to forego (or do not have the option of) life-sustaining treatments. We prefer the term &quot;comfort measures only&quot; instead of &quot;comfort care&quot; because the latter can be confused with care focused on sustaining life or curing disease that is <strong>simultaneously</strong> aimed at managing a patient's symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H15482459\" class=\"local\">'Comfort measures only'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A palliative care consultation may be appropriate for any ICU patient who has a chronic critical illness; has an indication for specific medical procedures (eg, tracheostomy placement, percutaneous gastrostomy tube); is &ge;80 years old; had significant medical comorbidities or poor functional status at baseline; has a chronic or life-limiting illnesses (eg, metastatic cancer); has specific acute illnesses with a poor prognosis (eg, anoxic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage requiring mechanical ventilation); or an overall poor prognosis as determined by an attending physician. (See <a href=\"#H1032755\" class=\"local\">'Indications for palliative care referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before patients are approached to make any medical decisions, decisional capacity related to the specific decision at hand should be determined. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While there is no clear evidence that standard advanced directives alter care once patients are in the ICU, the presence of advance directives have been shown to improve families' assessments of the quality of the dying process and decrease the burden on surrogate decision-makers. Furthermore, the process of advance care planning may be useful to help patients and their families make more informed decisions. (See <a href=\"#H15482489\" class=\"local\">'Advance directives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When patients lack decisional capacity, a person close to him or her is frequently called upon to participate in medical decision-making in the critical care setting. In the absence of a designated guardian or durable power of attorney for health care, clinicians rely on the legally defined &quot;next-of-kin&quot; to assist with medical decision-making. (See <a href=\"#H15482504\" class=\"local\">'Surrogate decision-makers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in the ICU for whom life-sustaining interventions are withdrawn, steps should be taken to maximize patient comfort and minimize any unnecessary interventions. (See <a href=\"#H5572235\" class=\"local\">'Patients for whom life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, it is appropriate to allow the family to witness CPR when they so wish. (See <a href=\"#H5572269\" class=\"local\">'CPR and families bearing witness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in the ICU, the provision of spiritual support should be offered utilizing pastoral services available at each institution. (See <a href=\"#H193412384\" class=\"local\">'Addressing religion and/or spirituality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We support interventions to help mitigate burnout, including interdisciplinary conferences and opportunities to discuss and enhance the provision of interdisciplinary decision-making in the critical care setting. (See <a href=\"#H15482369\" class=\"local\">'Staff support'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sprung CL, Cohen SL, Sjokvist P, et al.
