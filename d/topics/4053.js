SMZL was previously termed splenic lymphoma with circulating villous lymphocytes.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of SMZL will be discussed here.

The pathogenesis of SMZL is incompletely understood, but acquired mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and chronic immunologic stimulation both appear to be involved. </p><p>Molecular studies suggest alterations to pathways that result in the proliferation and commitment of mature B cells to marginal zone differentiation and homing to the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The following mutations have been identified in SMZL and are thought to play a role in this process:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NOTCH signaling mutations in 40 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NF-KB signaling mutations in 35 to 40 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KLF2 mutations in 20 to 40 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MYD88 mutations in 3 to 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CARD11 mutations in 5 to 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MLL2 mutations in 7 percent</p><p/><p>Involvement of Notch signaling in SMZL echoes the requirement for Notch2 in the development of mouse marginal zone B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. MYD88 and CARD11 mutations are likely to enhance B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. SMZL also has a microRNA signature that reproduces that of the normal marginal zone and memory B cell program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This microRNA signature likely influences the expression of genes involved in the NF-kB pathway, which is affected by recurrent gain-of-function mutations in SMZL.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have identified an association between SMZL and infection with viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Antigen receptors for HCV have been identified on some tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Treatment of coexisting HCV infection can induce regression of SMZL in some patients, and some studies have demonstrated a correlation between lymphoma disease activity and HCV load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, like other subtypes of marginal zone lymphoma, SMZL may be driven in part by chronic immunologic stimulation, at least early in the disease course. (See <a href=\"#H2288156377\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral therapy for hepatitis C'</a> below.) </p><p>The association between HCV and lymphomagenesis is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Lymphoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2340033351\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMZL constitutes &lt;1 percent of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], 1 to 2 percent of indolent lymphoid leukemias found on bone marrow examination, and up to 25 percent of low grade B cell neoplasms in splenectomy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The estimated incidence in the United States is 1.3 cases per million persons per year and appears to be increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,17</a>]. </p><p>SMZL occurs at a median age of 65 to 70; the disease is uncommon before age 50. SMZL occurs in all geographic locations, but the incidence in Whites is approximately twice that of other races [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There is no gender predominance.</p><p>There is an association with autoimmune conditions associated with B cell activation (eg, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, hemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia), asthma with or without other atopy, and chronic hepatitis C virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Studies have also suggested an association with the use of permanent hair dye and occupation as a metal worker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Lymphoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients typically present with splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, and cytopenias (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Many patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis; a minority will have symptoms related to the splenomegaly (eg, early satiety, abdominal discomfort) or cytopenias (eg, bleeding). Rare patients will present with lymphocytosis as the sole marker of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Unlike most other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, lymphadenopathy and significant involvement of extralymphatic organs is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Systemic B symptoms (eg, fatigue, night sweats, weight loss) and elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are rare and should lead to a more detailed investigation for large cell transformation. (See <a href=\"#H2640524601\" class=\"local\">'Large cell transformation'</a> below.)</p><p>The cytopenias are most commonly due to hypersplenism, but may be immune mediated. Approximately 20 percent of patients with SMZL have an autoimmune manifestation, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, cold agglutinin disease, antiphospholipid antibodies, acquired von Willebrand disease, and acquired C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H602530877\" class=\"local\">'Managing autoimmune complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Approximately one-third of patients have a small amount of circulating monoclonal protein, often IgM. In those with hepatitis C infection, mixed cryoglobulinemia and an associated small vessel vasculitis may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMZL is a neoplasm of small B lymphocytes that surround and replace splenic white pulp germinal centers, merging with an outer marginal zone of cells with more abundant pale cytoplasm. Variable numbers of cells with distinct nucleoli resembling immunoblasts may be admixed. Both small and large cells infiltrate red pulp, and villous lymphocytes often are seen circulating in the peripheral blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59065\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59065 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral blood</strong> &ndash; Involvement of the peripheral blood is common in SMZL. While there is morphologic heterogeneity, a typical tumor cell resembles a lymphocyte with a round nucleus, condensed chromatin, and abundant basophilic cytoplasm with small surface &quot;villous&quot; projections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59065\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59065 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/20,23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,29</a>]. These projections are often unevenly distributed around the circumference of the cell. Of importance, exposure of these cells to anticoagulants used in specimen storage can result in loss of these projections. Examination of a slide made from freshly drawn blood may be required to identify projections in suspected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Less commonly, tumor cells have a plasmacytoid appearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spleen</strong> &ndash; Pathologic examination of the spleen demonstrates involvement of both the white and red pulp in practically all cases of SMZL. In the white pulp, the neoplastic cells occupy both the mantle and marginal zones, sometimes with a central residual germinal center, which may be either atrophic or hyperplastic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72336\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72336 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/12,13,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,30</a>]. Both the mantle and marginal zones are expanded. The cells in the mantle zone are small, with slight nuclear irregularity and scant cytoplasm, while those in the marginal zone have more dispersed chromatin and abundant, pale cytoplasm, resembling marginal zone cells, and are admixed with variable numbers of larger activated cells resembling immunoblasts. In some tumors there is also a degree of plasmacytic differentiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The red pulp demonstrates both a diffuse and micronodular pattern of involvement with sinus infiltration. Epithelioid histiocytes may be present singly or in clusters, and, particularly in the bone marrow, may be so conspicuous as to suggest an infectious process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymph nodes</strong> &ndash; Splenic hilar lymph nodes are often involved; the neoplastic cells form vague nodules, often without a central germinal center; a marginal zone pattern may or may not be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Sinuses are often preserved and dilated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone marrow</strong> &ndash; Bone marrow involvement, if present, is often mild and can be subtle. The marrow usually contains discrete lymphoid aggregates, which may also have a marginal zone pattern, with or without diffuse intrasinusoidal lymphoid infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The nodular pattern of involvement can be helpful in distinguishing SMZL from hairy cell leukemia, which always involves the marrow in a diffuse interstitial pattern.

The cells are cyclin D1 negative by immunoperoxidase staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>As described in more detail below, the immunophenotype pattern can help to distinguish SMZL from other small B cell malignancies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of CD5 helps to distinguish SMZL from chronic lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/small</span> lymphocytic lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, but a significant minority of cases may be CD5 positive and must be distinguished based on other genetic, immunophenotypic, and morphologic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The absence of cyclin D1 staining also helps to distinguish SMZL from mantle cell lymphoma, which is cyclin D1 positive in a large majority of cases. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of CD103 and CD25 are useful in distinguishing SMZL from hairy cell leukemia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 80 percent of SMZL have an abnormal karyotype, often with complex chromosomal changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/23,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,35,36</a>]. No characteristic genetic abnormalities have been identified.</p><p>Analysis of the immunoglobulin variable region genes shows somatic mutations in approximately half of cases, consistent with a post-germinal center stage of B cell development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/2,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37,38</a>]. Ongoing mutation of V region genes, similar to germinal center cells, has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Trisomy 3, found in nodal and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, is detected in up to 39 percent of cases of SMZL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], although, unlike in these other disorders, the t(11;18) is lacking in SMZL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. BCL2 is germline and the t(11;14)(q13;q32) rearrangement is not present. </p><p>Other common genetic aberrations include gains of 12q, deletions of 7q and 6q, and various translocations involving the IgH locus (14q32) and regions on chromosome 1q and 8q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, del(7q) is the most common aberration in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]; although not pathognomonic, among indolent B cell tumors del(7q) is most common in SMZL. </p><p>Molecular studies have identified recurrent mutations in a number of genes, including gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH2 and in genes encoding components of the NF-KB signaling pathway. This is described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMZL is usually suspected in an adult presenting with unexplained splenomegaly and lymphocytosis. The diagnostic evaluation should include a complete blood count with differential and review of the peripheral smear, histologic review of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, immunophenotypic analysis of the tumor cells, and measurement of serum immunoglobulins. Other studies that may be of use in determining the diagnosis include a histologic review of splenic tissue and genetic mutation analysis.</p><p>The diagnosis of SMZL is made based on evaluation of the lymphocyte morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic analysis, bone marrow histology, and spleen histology, when available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The diagnosis of SMZL can most readily be made according to one of the following scenarios:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The splenic histology and immunophenotypic pattern are consistent with SMZL, as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If splenic tissue is not available for histologic review, the diagnosis of SMZL can be made in a patient with clinical splenomegaly and typical morphologic and immunophenotypic findings on blood smear and bone marrow biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with SMZL present with splenomegaly and lymphocytosis. There are numerous infectious (eg, infectious mononucleosis, pertussis, toxoplasmosis) and neoplastic conditions that can present with these findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-lymphocytosis-or-lymphocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with lymphocytosis or lymphocytopenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Causes of splenomegaly'</a>.)</p><p>Reactive follicular hyperplasia is much more common than SMZL in children, adolescents, and young adults, but is generally mild in degree. The enlarged spleen may have expanded white pulp on cut section, producing a superficial resemblance to lymphoma, but on microscopy the white pulp is expanded by normal-appearing reactive follicles and there is little or no lymphoid expansion in red pulp zones.</p><p>The most common neoplastic conditions that mimic SMZL are other low grade B cell proliferations involving the spleen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93308\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93308 \">table 1</a>). The most reliable means of distinguishing these tumors is immunophenotyping, but these distinctions are not absolute, and in some instances the diagnosis must be based on the combination of immunophenotypic, genetic, and morphologic findings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2927522587\"><span class=\"h2\">Extranodal and nodal marginal zone lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some cases of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) originating at mucosal sites (extranodal MZL) can disseminate to nodal sites, spleen, and bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In such cases it may be unclear exactly where the disease originated. One definitive clue is detection of the t(11;18), the t(14;18) (in this case involving the MALT1 gene on chromosome 18), the t(1;14), or the t(3;14), all of which may be seen in extranodal MZL, but not SMZL. By contrast, NOTCH2 mutations appear to be virtually unique to SMZL, but testing for this abnormality is not routinely performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nodal MZL is a primary nodal lymphoma with features identical to lymph nodes involved by extranodal MZL, but without evidence of extranodal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nodal MZL does not have splenic involvement. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1889370752\"><span class=\"h2\">Other splenic B cell neoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMZL must be distinguished from other low grade B cell proliferations involving the spleen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93308\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93308 \">table 1</a>). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hairy cell leukemia (HCL)</strong> &ndash; Both HCL and SMZL can present with splenomegaly and circulating lymphocytes with cytoplasmic projections, but are easily differentiated from each other by immunophenotype. Unlike HCL, SMZL tumors do not express CD103 or CD25. In addition, splenic white pulp involvement or nodular bone marrow involvement excludes the diagnosis of HCL. Classic HCL is virtually always associated with a V600E mutation involving the <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> kinase BRAF, while up to 50 percent of HCL variants have activating mutations in MAP2K1 (MEK1). These mutations are by contrast rare or nonexistent in SMZL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)</strong> &ndash; Both LPL and SMZL can have plasma cell differentiation and similar patterns of spleen and bone marrow involvement. The presence of prominent &quot;monocytoid&quot; B cells in the splenic white pulp marginal zones is typical of SMZL and can be helpful in making this distinction, as can the presence of &quot;villous&quot; lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Although SMZL may be associated with a small monoclonal immunoglobulin spike, large spikes are not seen and, if present, strongly support the diagnosis of LPL. In addition, virtually all LPLs have mutations in MYD88, while MYD88 mutations are relatively uncommon in SMZL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)</strong> &ndash; Both MCL and SMZL can present with splenomegaly and peripheral blood involvement, and can infiltrate both the red and white pulp of the spleen. In general, these two can be distinguished based upon histology and immunophenotype. On histology, MCL tumor cells are monomorphous small to medium-sized B lymphocytes while SMZL often contains a population of large immunoblast-like cells, cells with abundant pale cytoplasm (monocytoid B cell-like cells), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cells exhibiting plasmacytic differentiation. MCL typically expresses CD5, while only a minority of SMZL cases express CD5. In cases that express CD5, MCL can be ruled out by the absence of cyclin D1 and SOX11 expression, and lack of a t(11;14)(q13;q32) rearrangement.

In addition, both CLL and SMZL can express CD5, CD23, CD43, and IgD, although expression of these is much more typical of CLL. In difficult cases, evaluation of the hilar lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and bone marrow must be used in concert to determine the most likely diagnosis. In particular, the presence of proliferation centers is pathognomonic for CLL and excludes the diagnosis of SMZL.

As the name implies, this tumor shows diffuse involvement of red pulp cords and sinusoids, and does not involve the white pulp follicles or marginal zones. Marrow involvement most commonly takes the form of sinusoidal infiltrates; while nodular interstitial infiltrates can also be seen in the marrow, marginal zone growth about reactive-appearing follicles, often seen in SMZL, is absent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75322876\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is used to categorize individuals who have an absolute increase in the number of clonal B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood that does not exceed <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> (5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> and who have no lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenias, or disease-related symptoms.

We evaluate patients three months following the completion of therapy to assess response and determine a new baseline of disease with which to compare at the time of suspected progression. At this evaluation, we usually perform a complete blood count with differential and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

The frequency and extent of these visits depends upon the comfort of both the patient and physician. There have been no prospective, randomized trials comparing various schedules of follow-up. When planning the post-treatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of CT scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies. We generally follow patients every three to four months for the first year and then every six months, if stable.
