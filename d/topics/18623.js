In industrialized nations, because of vaccination programs against hepatitis B, hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become the primary cause of chronic viral hepatitis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], with vertical transmission becoming the leading source of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Vertical transmission refers to viral transmission from the mother to the infant during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, or during the first 28 days after birth.</p><p>The issues surrounding vertical transmission of HCV are reviewed here. Discussion of the effects of pregnancy on HCV infection and HCV infection in children are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease#H146902198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with pre-existing chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Chronic hepatitis C'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C virus infection in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68345571\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms underlying vertical transmission of HCV are poorly understood. Intrauterine transmission during pregnancy and infection at the time of delivery are both possible, although it appears that the majority of HCV-infected infants are infected perinatally (either late intrauterine or intrapartum). </p><p>The timing of transmission can be reflected by results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for HCV RNA, which may not be positive until several weeks following infection, when levels of viremia reach the detection threshold. In most infants, HCV RNA levels only become detectable several weeks after birth, suggesting perinatal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. However, detection of HCV RNA within a few days of delivery has also been described, suggesting that in utero infection earlier in pregnancy can also occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertical transmission of HCV has been documented in numerous studies, but estimates on the rate of transmission vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/9-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-23</a>]. Some of the variability in estimates of may be the result of differences in study methodologies and maternal populations studied. Overall, it appears that the risk of vertical transmission is approximately five percent in viremic women, with higher rates in certain subgroups, namely women who are coinfected with HIV. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'HIV coinfection'</a> below.). </p><p>One meta-analysis included 20 studies of pregnant women with chronic HCV infection (HCV antibody and RNA positive) that determined transmission by laboratory testing of the infant after at least 18 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The pooled transmission rate was 5.8 percent (95% CI 4.2-7.8) among women with HCV monoinfection and 10.8 percent (95% CI 7.6-15.2) among those with <span class=\"nowrap\">HCV/HIV</span> coinfection. These results were generally consistent with a prior systematic review, in which the overall adjusted rate of vertical HCV transmission from anti-HCV antibody positive women was 1.7 percent, but 4.3 percent among HCV viremic women and up to 19.4 percent in <span class=\"nowrap\">HCV/HIV-coinfected</span> women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In the United States, given this risk of vertical transmission and the rising rates of HCV infection in women of childbearing age, the prevalence of HCV infection in children appears to be substantially underestimated. One study estimated that 29,000 women with HCV infection gave birth each year between 2011 and 2014 in the United States, which would translate to an estimated 1700 infants infected annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, among children aged 2 to 13 years, only an average of 207 HCV infections were reported each year during that time period. Although advances in HCV treatment since the time of this study have the potential to reduce the burden of HCV infection among women of childbearing age, these data highlight the importance of screening at-risk women and linking those with HCV infection to care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C virus infection in children&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISHED RISK FACTORS FOR TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of vertical transmission. The most consistent associations have been with maternal HCV viremia during pregnancy or at the time of delivery and with concomitant HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, other variables, such as maternal intravenous drug use and peripheral blood mononuclear cell infection, also appear to increase the risk of transmission. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">HCV viremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertical transmission is generally confined to women with detectable HCV RNA during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/10,18,19,22,27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,19,22,27-33</a>], though it has been reported in women without detectable HCV RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/18,27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27,31</a>]. This may have occurred because viremia can be intermittent, so a negative test earlier in pregnancy does not preclude viremia in the perinatal period. Mothers who have antibodies to HCV but are negative for HCV RNA virtually never transmit infection to their infants. </p><p>Studies have reached conflicting results with regard to whether the level of viremia is correlated with the risk of vertical transmission. Multiple studies have noted an increased risk of transmission with higher HCV viral loads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/10,22,33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22,33-37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that included 190 infants born to HCV RNA-positive women, transmission of the virus occurred in 9 (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

A systematic review that included 20 studies estimated that in women who were coinfected with HIV, the risk of vertical transmission was increased approximately two-fold compared with women who were HIV-uninfected (10.8 versus 5.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The increased rate of vertical transmission in HIV-coinfected mothers may in part be explained by higher HCV RNA levels resulting from HIV-mediated immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/11,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,42</a>]. For example, in one study, the average HCV RNA titers were approximately 10 times higher in women coinfected with HCV and HIV compared with women who were infected by HCV alone (7.8 x 10<sup>6</sup> versus 9 x 10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The importance of HIV-mediated immunosuppression was suggested in a series of 155 children born to HCV RNA-positive mothers who were followed for at least 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Although 15 mothers were HIV-coinfected, none transmitted HCV to their offspring. All of the HIV-infected women were taking antiretroviral therapy, and their mean HCV RNA titer was similar to the HIV-negative mothers. Thus, whether HIV is an independent risk factor for vertical transmission of HCV or whether HIV confers increased risk of vertical transmission simply because HIV-coinfected mothers have higher HCV titers is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-c-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, natural history, and diagnosis of hepatitis C in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interestingly, infants of coinfected mothers who become infected with HIV have a greater risk of developing HCV infection compared with infants who do not become infected with HIV (17 versus 5 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Why this might occur is not clear.

In a study of 1372 HCV-positive women, a history of intravenous drug use was a significant predictor of HCV transmission to the infant (adjusted odds ratio 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2-1.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The higher transmission rate may be related to an increased frequency of peripheral blood mononuclear cell infection in women with a history of intravenous drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/43,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,47</a>].

In a study of 48 mothers with HCV who transmitted the virus to their infants and 122 mothers with HCV who did not transmit the virus, PBMC infection was significantly more likely in mothers who transmitted the virus compared with mothers who did not (100 versus 54 percent). It has been hypothesized that PBMC infection may increase the risk of HCV transmission by serving as a vector for the HCV or because the viral variant of HCV that infects PBMCs is able to interact with and overcome the immune cells of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68345885\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE RISK FACTORS FOR TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the established risk factors described above, other risk factors that are not as clearly established but that may increase the risk of vertical transmission of HCV included prolonged rupture of membranes and the performance of obstetric procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2715675347\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive prenatal testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive prenatal testing could theoretically increase the risk of transmission by increasing fetal exposure to maternal blood, although limited data have not suggested a clear risk with amniocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. There are no data on the risk with chorionic villous sampling.

Rupture of membranes for six or more hours prior to delivery has been identified as a risk factor for transmission in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/31,35,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35,51,52</a>], though not all studies confirm the association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

The possible risks of interventions during management of labor should be weighed against the obstetrical indications and benefits.

Genotype 1 was most common (59 percent), followed by genotypes 2 (20.5 percent), 3 (19 percent), and 4 (1.5 percent). There was no difference in transmission rates between the mother who transmitted the virus and those who did not with regard to HCV genotype. Similar results were seen in a second study with 113 women, in whom the HIV infection rate was lower (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Theoretically, the mode of delivery may be important because exposure to HCV-infected blood as the infant passes through the birth canal could lead to HCV transmission. However, exposure to maternal blood can also occur with cesarean delivery. Currently, pregnant women infected with HCV are <strong>not</strong> advised to have cesarean delivery, unless indicated for other reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Preoperative planning and patient preparation&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>Among women who are not infected with HIV, the mode of delivery does not appear to influence transmission rates. In a meta-analysis that included eight studies with 641 mother-infant pairs, there was no significant difference in HCV transmission among HIV-negative women who had a cesarean delivery and those who had a vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>However, among HIV-positive women, some older studies suggest cesarean delivery may decrease the risk of HCV transmission. In study of 1419 women with HCV, 503 (35 percent) were coinfected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. HCV infection was seen in 70 of the infants born to HIV-positive women (14 percent) and in 60 of the infants born to HIV-negative women (7 percent). Among the women with HIV for whom delivery information was available, 159 (33 percent) had a cesarean delivery and 329 (67 percent) had a vaginal delivery. On multivariable analysis, HCV transmission was significantly less likely to occur with cesarean delivery (odds ratio 0.4). </p><p>However, with widespread use of antiretroviral therapy for HIV, the benefit of cesarean delivery may no longer exist. In a subsequent study with 1479 mother-infant pairs, there was no benefit from cesarean delivery for women coinfected with HCV and HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In that study, 83 percent of women who were coinfected with HIV received antiretroviral treatment for their HIV. Thus, recommendations regarding the mode of delivery in women who are coinfected with HIV depend upon the status of the patient's HIV infection at the time of delivery.

The situation is more complex in women who are coinfected with HIV and HCV, in whom the risk of HIV transmission also is an issue.

In one study, for example, none of the 76 samples of breast milk from 73 HCV antibody-positive (60 percent HCV RNA positive) mothers contained HCV RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Only one of the 76 breast-fed infants had evidence of HCV infection by PCR; this infant's HCV infection was detected one month after birth, indicating that transmission via breast milk was unlikely. (See <a href=\"#H68345571\" class=\"local\">'Timing of transmission'</a> above.)</p><p>Other studies evaluating the effect of breastfeeding on HCV transmission concur with these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]; either similar rates of infection are observed in breast-fed and bottle-fed groups, or no viral transmission was documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/19,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,63,64</a>]. Breast milk itself may inhibit HCV infectivity. This was suggested by an in vitro study in which incubation in pre-frozen breast milk from uninfected donors, but not infant formula or milk from other species, reduced the infectivity of an experimental virus in a cell culture system, possibly through disruption of the viral envelope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Other potential explanations as to why breast milk containing HCV RNA does not infect infants include inactivation of the virus by the acidity of the stomach and very low levels of HCV RNA in breast milk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H160622615\"><span class=\"h2\">IL28B genotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IL28B genotype is an important predictor of clearance versus persistence of HCV infection. However, it does not appear to be associated with the risk of vertical transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborn infants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection usually are asymptomatic, and a substantial proportion have normal or only mildly elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/27,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,66,67</a>]. In one study, for example, 104 infants with vertically acquired HCV infection were followed from birth for a mean of 49 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although at least 90 percent of the infants had evidence of ongoing infection (based upon PCR analysis for the detection of HCV RNA), clinical manifestations were rare. None of the infants had significant growth failure. Most had transient or persistent increases in serum ALT concentrations. The serum ALT usually was only mildly elevated or normal at birth, increasing at four to six months of age. Levels remained elevated for two years and declined substantially thereafter in most infants.</p><p>Twenty infants underwent liver biopsy. Although no single typical histologic feature was observed, all had histologic evidence of minimal to moderate chronic hepatitis, and three had some degree of fibrosis. Similar findings were reported in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. Overall, the data suggest that vertically acquired HCV infection is usually asymptomatic during infancy but often is associated with elevation of ALT concentrations during the first 6 to 12 months of life.</p><p>Although progression to chronicity occurs in most infants with vertically acquired HCV, liver disease usually is mild throughout childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C virus infection in children&quot;, section on 'Natural history'</a>.)</p><p>One of the largest series with long-term follow-up of children with perinatally acquired HCV included 266 children who were followed for a median of 4.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Approximately 20 percent cleared the infection at a median age of 15 months, whereas 80 percent had chronic infection. Clearance was less likely in children who were persistently PCR positive during the first year of life and in those who remained PCR positive after the first year of life. Most children with chronic infection were asymptomatic. Hepatomegaly was observed in 10 percent.</p><p>Additional long-term follow-up studies are necessary to determine what proportion of infants with vertically acquired HCV will develop hepatic failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the diagnosis of HCV in children born to infected mothers is to check an anti-HCV antibody test after 18 months of age. </p><p>If the antibody test is negative, the child is not infected. If the antibody test is positive, we check the HCV RNA level. An undetectable HCV RNA confirms that the child is not infected (and the positive antibody test reflected either a false-positive or an infection that spontaneously cleared). A detectable HCV RNA confirms that the child is infected. Additional evaluation of HCV-infected children, including monitoring for subsequent spontaneous clearance, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C virus infection in children&quot;, section on 'Further evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-children#H2998984414\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C virus infection in children&quot;, section on 'Subsequent monitoring'</a>.) </p><p>Prior to age 18 months, anti-HCV antibody testing is not specific for infection because a positive test could reflect maternal IgG antibodies that have passively crossed the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Passively acquired maternal antibodies against HCV are cleared in 95 percent of infants by 12 months, although some take longer than 12 months to clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/17,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,70</a>]. Furthermore, although the presence of HCV viremia in infancy suggests acute infection, it may not result in chronic infection because of the possibility of spontaneous clearance.</p><p>Thus, attempts at diagnosis of HCV prior to 18 months of age can be difficult to interpret, and we generally do not do it. The joint American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases <span class=\"nowrap\">(AASLD)/Infectious</span> Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines indicate that if earlier testing is desired for purposes of improving testing rates, HCV RNA can be performed between two and six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A negative or positive test at this time point suggests against or for infection, respectively. Regardless of the results, however, anti-HCV antibody testing should be performed after 18 months of age for a more definitive diagnosis, as above. Repeated HCV RNA testing prior to 18 months of age is unnecessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18554145\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main strategy for reducing the risk of vertical HCV transmission is identifying and treating HCV-infected women prior to conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus/abstract/54,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,71</a>]. The practical benefits of this strategy, however, are limited among patients with high rates of unintended pregnancies. HCV screening recommendations for pregnant women are the same as those for the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of note, women who were treated with a ribavirin-containing regimen should avoid pregnancy for at least six months afterwards.</p><p>Otherwise, no other interventions have documented efficacy in reducing vertical HCV transmission. Antiviral therapy is not an option since the safety and efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agents in pregnancy have not been evaluated (and they should thus not be used in pregnant patients). Further studies are needed to assess these issues and inform the potential role of these antiviral agents to treat maternal HCV infection and prevent transmission to the infant.</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of HCV in nonpregnant adults is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The transmission rate is approximately 5 percent among HCV-monoinfected women and approximately 10 percent among <span class=\"nowrap\">HCV/HIV-coinfected</span> women. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'HIV coinfection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to HIV coinfection, other risk factors for transmission include high HCV viral load, a history of intravenous drug use, and HCV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Prolonged rupture of membranes and the performance of obstetric procedures such as fetal scalp monitoring may also be associated with vertical transmission. When possible, obstetric procedures should be avoided in women with HCV. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Established risk factors for transmission'</a> above and <a href=\"#H68345885\" class=\"local\">'Possible risk factors for transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that are not associated with the vertical transmission of HCV include viral genotype, the mode of delivery (in HIV-uninfected women or in HIV-infected women who are taking antiretroviral therapy), and breastfeeding. Currently, pregnant women infected with HCV are <strong>not</strong> advised to have cesarean delivery, unless indicated for other reasons. (See <a href=\"#H68345893\" class=\"local\">'Factors not associated with transmission'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants who acquire HCV vertically are typically asymptomatic, though an elevation in alanine aminotransferase is common. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HCV in infants born to HCV-infected mothers is made by checking an anti-HCV antibody test after 18 months of age. Those with a negative test are uninfected. Those with a positive test should have HCV RNA tested. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main strategy for reducing the risk of vertical HCV transmission is identifying and treating HCV-infected women prior to conception. The safety and efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agents during pregnancy and in neonates have not yet been assessed, and these agents should not be used in such populations.
