In countries where oral vitamin K is the standard, IM rather than oral prophylaxis should be administered to infants who are preterm, receiving antibiotics, or who have liver disease or diarrhea, because they may have decreased absorption of the oral preparation. VKDB may still develop despite IM administration of vitamin K in neonates with liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-routine-management-of-the-healthy-newborn-infant/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Parents need to be counseled about the potential dire consequences of VKDB (eg, intestinal hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage with subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment and possible death) if their infant does not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin K</a>.

This approach, which is consistent with guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), was supported by a study using data from a large health care system, which showed that early follow-up visits reduced the rate of rehospitalization for infants with a birth hospitalization of less than 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-routine-management-of-the-healthy-newborn-infant/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Earlier follow-up visits within 24 to 48 hours after hospital discharge, regardless of length of hospital stay, are particularly important for the following: late preterm and early term infants, newborns with weight loss &gt;8 percent, newborns with risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia, and newborns who were treated with phototherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">READMISSIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite enactment of the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act (NMHPA), potentially preventable readmissions of newborns continue to occur. Newborn readmission is associated with early discharge, inexperienced parenting, difficulty establishing infant feeding, and being of Asian or Pacific Islander descent as these infants have an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-routine-management-of-the-healthy-newborn-infant/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>These factors were identified in an analysis of 2540 newborns readmitted in the first 10 days of life based on clinical discharge records collected by the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-routine-management-of-the-healthy-newborn-infant/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this cohort, the mean time to readmission was 111 hours since birth and 62 hours since nursery discharge. Jaundice was the most common diagnosis occurring in 92 percent of the infants. The remaining infants were readmitted for dehydration, feeding problems, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p>These findings may be useful in providing additional support for at-risk families and anticipatory care, thereby decreasing the need for readmission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Approximately 90 percent of infants will not require further intervention in the delivery room, and these infants should be given to their mothers for skin-to-skin contact and initiation of breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Delivery room care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the transitional period (first four to six hours of life), optimal routine care, which begins in the delivery room, includes promoting early bonding with skin-to-skin contact and early initiation of breastfeeding, and monitoring the clinical status of the infant every 30 to 60 minutes to determine whether further intervention is required. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Transitional period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine care includes a thorough evaluation performed within 24 hours of birth to identify any abnormality that would alter the newborn course or identify a medical condition that should be addressed during the first days of life. The assessment includes a review of the maternal, family, and prenatal history and a complete physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-the-newborn-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of the newborn infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all neonates are treated with an ophthalmic antibiotic agent shortly after birth to prevent gonococcal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In our practice we use 0.5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">erythromycin</a> ointment (1 cm ribbon in each eye). Alternative medications, which are not available in the United States, include 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a> solution, 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracycline</a> ointment, or 2.5 percent povidone-iodine solution.

These include normal and stable vital signs for at least 12 hours before discharge, evidence of urination and stooling, completion of two successful feedings, no physical abnormalities requiring continued care, no evidence of excessive bleeding (especially in infants who are circumcised), and successful training of the family to provide ongoing care at home. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Discharge criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, legislation requires insurance plans to cover postpartum stays up to 48 hours for infants born by vaginal deliveries and up to 96 hours for cesarean deliveries without complications. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Discharge legislation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At discharge, a medical home should be identified and an appropriately timed follow-up visit should be made. For all infants who are discharged before 48 hours of age, follow-up assessment is performed within 48 hours, and no later than 72 hours after discharge. The follow-up visit should include assessment of the general health of the infant, the infant-mother interaction, parent's well-being, and infant behavior, verification of ongoing health care, and parental education.
