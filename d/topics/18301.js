As the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> infection has decreased, NSAID-related ulceration is the major cause of ulcer disease in many parts of the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several studies in the United States have shown that less than 75 percent of patients with duodenal ulcers (DUs) not associated with use of NSAIDs are related to <em>H. pylori </em>infection. In one study, after excluding NSAID use, 61 percent of DUs and 63 percent of gastric ulcers were <em>H. pylori</em> positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Only 52 percent of whites with DUs were <em>H. pylori</em> positive, compared with 85 percent of nonwhites, underscoring the importance of demographics. In a retrospective study conducted over five years in a large tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom, <em>H. pylori</em>-negative, NSAID-negative ulcers accounted for 12 percent of all ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The etiology of these ulcers remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Before focusing on other etiologies of PUD, it is important to carefully exclude <em>H. pylori</em> infection and NSAID use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75002 \">table 1</a>). False negative <em>H. pylori</em> testing is commonly encountered, particularly with tests that depend upon the number of organisms (rapid urease testing on gastric mucosal biopsies, urea breath testing, histology, and stool antigen) when the patient has recently taken antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, or bismuth. Several lines of evidence indicate that <em>H. pylori</em> is frequently missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For example, serology is positive in some ulcer patients when other tests are negative; although some of these results may be false positives, some are due to suppression of organisms or isolated duodenal colonization, as considered below (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-diagnostic-tests-for-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>). In the United States, NSAIDs are so widely available, as over-the-counter medications that patients may not remember or report using them. Furthermore, approximately one-half of patients with aggressive ulcer disease attributable to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> deny taking aspirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Aspirin use has been detected in such patients by serum salicylate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Given the rarity of other causes of peptic ulcer disease, the clinician should carefully assess the work-up for <em>H. pylori</em> and repeat it if necessary and re-evaluate the history of NSAID use before initiating a work-up for rare causes of ulcer disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">UNUSUAL CAUSES OF PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE AND UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors and disorders have been implicated as causes of secondary peptic ulcer disease (PUD). A small proportion of acid hypersecretory and nonhypersecretory peptic ulcers remain at present in an idiopathic category; however, with careful evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75002 \">table 1</a>), this idiopathic category is very small. It is important to exclude malignancy as the cause of gastric and, rarely, duodenal ulcers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs other than NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of drugs that cause or exacerbate gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ulcer disease, or both, and the list is growing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79691\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79691 \">table 2</a>). The role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is well established (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>). However, NSAIDs also appear to exacerbate the toxicity of several other drugs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Acetaminophen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A role for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> in development of GI complications (including bleeding and perforation) has been suggested in both population-based studies and a randomized controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. As a general rule, the risk was increased only in doses of 2 to 3 g per day or higher. The risk also appears to be increased with the combination of NSAIDs plus high-dose acetaminophen compared with either alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. A randomized trial suggested that coadministration of paracetamol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> was not associated with a significant difference in endoscopic&nbsp;ulcer&nbsp;rates compared with either drug alone, but there were more endoscopic erosions and ulcers in the combined group compared with either aspirin or paracetamol alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Bisphosphonates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage and acute ulceration have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Population-based studies show that use of bisphosphonates such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> are associated with a higher risk of upper and lower GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The risk appears to be increased substantially with coadministration of NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-of-bisphosphonate-therapy-in-patients-with-osteoporosis#H4000461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between corticosteroids and PUD and its complications is controversial. Many of the studies used to support an association with steroids had significant limitations. A systematic review found that corticosteroids were associated with a significantly increased risk of bleeding and perforation from ulcers in hospitalized patients. In outpatients, the risk was small and not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Clopidogrel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antiplatelet agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> is a significant risk factor for GI bleeding, particularly in patients with a prior risk of bleeding or on cotherapy with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The risk may also be increased with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a>, but data are limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction#H514073031\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet agents in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Early CABG'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Sirolimus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sirolimus</a> has been associated with aggressive ulcer disease in patients undergoing transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Sirolimus is known to inhibit wound healing and has been associated with small bowel ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, this connection is convincing and warrants cautious use of this agent in patients with a history of PUD and aggressive management of patients on the drug who develop symptoms or complications suggestive of PUD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Spironolactone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least two studies have implicated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> as a cause of upper GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In both studies, the risk of serious upper GI bleeding was increased nearly threefold among users of spironolactone. Furthermore, in one of the studies, the risk increased with high doses, suggesting dose-related toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk was also increased with advancing age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are increasing data suggesting an impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> on the risk of peptic ulcer and upper GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/22-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-28</a>]. The risk of both uncomplicated PUD and ulcer-related bleeding is higher in patients taking SSRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A concomitant <em>H. pylori</em> infection appears to increase the risk of serious upper GI bleeding in patients on SSRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The risk of bleeding is also higher in patients with a history of peptic ulcer, with increasing age and duration of SSRI use, and when SSRIs are combined with antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) or NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. In a population-based cohort study, the use of SSRIs alone or in combination with NSAIDs was not associated with an increased 30-day mortality following a peptic ulcer bleed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In one large nested case-control study, the risk of upper GI bleeding was only apparent in non-users of acid inhibitors, suggesting that acid suppression attenuates the impact of SSRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Short-time use of SSRIs (14 days) has also been associated with an increased risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A systematic review suggested there was an approximately twofold increase in the risk for upper GI hemorrhage in SSRI users, and the risk appears to be greatest in those using NSAIDs or antiplatelet drugs concomitantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19092613\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain forms of chemotherapy have been associated with peptic disease. As an example, patients receiving continuous hepatic artery infusion of 5-fluorouracil frequently complain of abdominal pain. In one series, endoscopy usually revealed duodenal, gastric, or pyloric ulcerations and erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The mechanisms have not been established; catheter migration with direct gastric infusion of chemotherapy did not explain most cases. These lesions responded to discontinuation of chemotherapy; H2 receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) appeared to have little efficacy, but have not been formally tested.</p><p>Some specific drugs used for chemotherapy may cause ulceration. One example is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a>, a reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor used for cancer treatment. GI bleeding from peptic ulcers and ulcer perforation have been reported; not surprisingly, the risk appears greater when erlotinib is combined with NSAIDs, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, and in patients with a peptic ulcer history or treated with anticoagulants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19092697\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal or mediator-induced, including secondary acid hypersecretory states</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic tetrad of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome consists of a non-beta islet cell tumor secreting gastrin in association with acid hypersecretion and severe PUD, which occurs in approximately 90 percent of cases.

However, some occur in association with the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 (MEN1). MEN1 is a familial disorder characterized by an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumors of the parathyroid glands (which occur in nearly all patients by age 50), anterior pituitary, and pancreatic islet cells (gastrinoma or insulinoma).

It is important to stress that the majority of patients with hypergastrinemia have acid <strong>hypo</strong>secretion, with hypergastrinemia resulting from decreased acid feedback inhibition of gastrin release. Provocative testing is useful in patients in whom the elevation in serum gastrin concentration is not dramatic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic mastocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic mastocytosis is characterized by mast cell infiltration of many tissues and symptoms of flushing, pruritus, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Dyspepsia, duodenal ulcers, and severe duodenitis occur in 30 to 50 percent of cases and can be associated with basal acid hypersecretion, a presentation sometimes reminiscent of gastrinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Serum histamine concentrations may be elevated, particularly in the setting of ulcer disease, suggesting that circulating histamine contributes to basal acid hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. The dyspeptic symptoms and duodenal ulcers are readily treated by an H2 receptor antagonist. Patients with mastocytosis have higher prevalence rates of duodenal ulcer and GI bleeding from an unknown source than healthy controls. The bleeding may be severe, and the symptoms that precede the episode of bleeding are often nonspecific and resemble irritable bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The precipitating cause may be reduced mucosal blood flow due to increased viscosity. A study suggested that patients with polycythemia vera are at greater risk for <em>H. pylori</em> infection and have a higher prevalence of ulcers and erosions in the stomach and duodenum than controls without the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Antral G-cell hyperfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the pre-<em>H. pylori</em> era, an entity called antral G-cell hyperfunction was reported, characterized by duodenal ulcers, increased basal- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meal-stimulated gastrin release, and usually increased basal or maximal acid output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. It now appears probable that antral G-cell hyperfunction usually reflects an exaggerated response to <em>H. pylori</em>-induced hypergastrinemia, being part of the spectrum of <em>H. pylori</em>-associated duodenal ulcers. In <em>H. pylori</em>-positive patients who appear to have this disorder, anti-<em>H. pylori</em> therapy induces ulcer healing and suppresses serum gastrin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p>Although controversial and rare, antral G-cell hyperfunction can probably occur in the absence of <em>H. pylori</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/49,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,51</a>].

Patients present with pain, bleeding, or perforation. Ulcers occurring in the immediate postoperative period present with bleeding and pain, and the bleeding site can usually be reached with the standard upper endoscope.

A number of causes have been suggested for marginal ulceration, including surgical technique resulting in ischemia at the anastomosis, <em>H. pylori</em> infection, and drug-induced ulceration caused by NSAIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

Although peptic ulcers associated with cirrhosis are often asymptomatic, there is a high rate of complications and frequent recurrence.</p><p>The mechanism of the association of peptic ulcer with cirrhosis is unknown. Alcohol ingestion is not an explanation since there is no convincing evidence that alcohol, per se, is a risk factor for peptic ulcer and the association is evident for all forms of cirrhosis.

Patients with stress ulceration following acute events, such as sepsis, pulmonary failure, or operation, were excluded from this analysis. </p><p>The role of <em>H. pylori</em> is controversial; at most, it plays a role in a subset of patients. When 32 patients with peptic ulcer and chronic renal failure were followed for two years after <em>H. pylori</em> eradication, there were eight ulcer recurrences (25 percent), whereas there were two recurrences among 64 peptic ulcer patients without renal failure who also had <em>H. pylori</em> eradicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].

Thus, antiulcer prophylaxis is routine in most centers, but there are limited data from well-controlled trials to guide treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and peptic ulcers has been suspected for many years. The frequency of chronic lung disease in patients with peptic ulcer is increased two to three times over the general population and peptic ulcers, both gastric and duodenal, occur in up to 30 percent of patients with chronic lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/124-126\" class=\"abstract_t\">124-126</a>].</p><p>The association between these diseases is not influenced by the clinical severity or therapy of the lung disease. The major factor underlying the association may be the impact of cigarette smoking on both diseases. In one series of Japanese men living in Hawaii, cigarettes were associated with an increased risk of gastric and duodenal ulcer, but showed a dose-response in pack-years only for gastric ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].</p><p>In a study that included 62,876 patients (32,682 patients with COPD and 30,194 age and gender matched controls without COPD) with eight years of follow-up, bleeding from peptic ulcers occurred in 2.9 percent of patients with COPD and in 1.7 percent of patients without COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, history of peptic ulcer disease, and NSAID use, COPD appeared to be an independent risk factor for peptic ulcer bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.73-2.17). Unfortunately, the database did not contain information on smoking or <em>H. pylori</em>, therefore precluding any conclusions about whether this relation between COPD and peptic ulcer bleeding was direct or indirect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19093842\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Admissions for complicated ulcer disease are significantly higher for diabetic patients than for controls. In one study, predictors of hospital admission included age, kidney function, non-aspirin anticoagulant use, sulfonylurea therapy, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetic retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Rheumatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peptic ulcer prevalence is markedly increased in patients with rheumatic disease due to the use of NSAIDs. Duodenal and gastric ulcers are more prevalent in NSAID users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. However, many of these ulcers are endoscopic ulcers and will not present as clinical ulcer events. For this reason, consideration should be given to prophylaxis (eg, with a proton pump inhibitor or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>), but only in high-risk patients. There is no evidence for any association independent of NSAIDs.

False-negative testing for <em>H. pylori</em> and a failure to detect NSAID use are probably the most common causes of apparently <em>H. pylori</em>-negative, NSAID-negative ulcers. For <em>H. pylori</em>, particular caution is needed because many of the patients being evaluated will have been treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or antibiotics, rendering tests dependent upon bacterial density less reliable (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-diagnostic-tests-for-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>). In patients with refractory or complicated ulcers, in addition to a careful history, serum salicylate levels may be useful in detecting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less common causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79691\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79691 \">table 2</a>) are likely to take on increasing relative importance because of the rapid decline in <em>H. pylori</em> infection in developed countries, the availability of NSAIDs with lower risk of ulcer complications, and the use of concomitant therapies (such as PPIs), which reduce ulcer risk under most circumstances. An approach to patients in whom these diagnoses are considered should be based upon the clinical suspicion for a particular diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic testing when needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75002 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the exception of acid hypersecretory states where it is clear that titrating PPI therapy is fully effective, there have been no rigorous studies of treatment of non-<em>H. pylori</em>, non-NSAID ulcer disease. PPI therapy provides the best option, although effectiveness is likely to be compromised when the underlying cause cannot be reversed, such as with medical comorbidity or ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management#H434386266\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.) </p><p/><p>A growing list of drugs has been implicated in the development of upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications. These drugs should be avoided, if possible, in patients taking NSAIDS or who are at high risk for bleeding or ulcer complications and in patients with a past history of peptic ulcer. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Drugs other than NSAIDs'</a> above.)</p><p>As general rules:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs, including low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, act synergistically with other ulcerogenic or antithrombotic agents to cause upper GI complications.
