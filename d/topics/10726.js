This complication can occur with either paroxysmal (intermittent) or chronic (permanent) atrial fibrillation. A number of randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in reducing this risk both during the course of chronic AF and in the period prior to and after the restoration of sinus rhythm.

These abnormalities in blood flow and vessels (the first two components of Virchow's triad) can be related to the presence of structural heart disease or extrinsic interventions such as cardioversion. As will be described below, AF also may confer a hypercoagulable or prothrombotic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Pooled data from a meta-analysis have demonstrated that independent clinical risk factors for stroke in nonvalvular AF include a history of hypertension and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with heart failure are also at high risk, particularly those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or aneurysm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Risk of embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These clinical criteria are complemented by echocardiographic findings, which have demonstrated that a dilated left atrium, impaired left atrial function, and impaired left ventricular systolic function are independent risk factors for stroke in patients with AF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64291 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72745 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Patients with these abnormalities are more likely to have stasis of blood as demonstrated by the presence of spontaneous echo contrast or &quot;smoke&quot; on transesophageal echocardiography; this increase in echogenicity is thought to represent aggregation of red cells at low shear stress (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66980\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66980 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66795\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66795 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51472\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51472 \">movie 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Spontaneous echo contrast has been related to hemodynamic and hemostatic abnormalities and an increased risk of stroke and thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. The presence of both left atrial spontaneous echo contrast and chamber enlargement among patients with nonrheumatic AF is strongly associated with an increased risk for cerebral ischemic events (odds ratio 33.7 in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast does not appear to be affected by anticoagulant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of echocardiography in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial stunning after cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation leads to an increased risk of thromboembolism, particularly if patients are not anticoagulated before, during, and after cardioversion. In addition to dislodgement of pre-existing thrombi, embolization may result from de novo thrombus formation induced by impaired left atrial systolic function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The transient atrial contractile dysfunction is also known as atrial &quot;stunning,&quot; and can occur whether sinus rhythm is restored spontaneously, by external or internal DC (electric) cardioversion, or by drugs. The duration of the left atrial dysfunction appears to be related in part to the duration of AF. In one report, full recovery of atrial mechanical function was attained within 24 hours in patients with AF for &le;2 weeks, within one week in patients with AF for two to six weeks, and within one month with more prolonged AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The time course of recovery of left atrial function could explain why the great majority of embolic events in patients who remain in sinus rhythm occur within the first 10 days after cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamic-consequences-of-atrial-fibrillation-and-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'Atrial stunning'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from a meta-analysis suggest that paroxysmal AF also confers an increased risk of stroke, with an event rate similar to that of chronic atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) In comparison, previous reports from the Framingham study and Montreal Heart study had suggested thromboembolic rates for paroxysmal AF that were intermediate between those associated with chronic atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This variability in risk is probably related to the frequency and duration of the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A single, short paroxysm of AF once a year is unlikely to have the same thromboembolic risk as more prolonged and more frequent paroxysms of AF. The effect of age and presence of structural heart disease are also considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Paroxysmal AF is associated with abnormalities in atrial function, as evidenced by the appearance of spontaneous echo contrast on transesophageal echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and in hemostasis which presumably contribute to the increase in thrombotic risk. One report supported the importance of AF duration as levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 (markers of platelet activation) were significantly increased during episodes more than 12 hours in duration; there was also a trend toward an elevation in fibrinogen levels in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another series, patients with paroxysmal AF had intermediate values of fibrinogen and fibrin D-dimer between normals and elevations seen in patients with chronic AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In contrast, patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, who retain active atrial contraction and have a low risk of stroke, had levels of hemostatic markers that were similar to controls in sinus rhythm.</p><p>The transient nature of hemodynamic and hemostatic abnormalities in paroxysmal AF is in keeping with the following clinical observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboembolism is more likely in patients with frequent paroxysms of atrial fibrillation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a clustering of thromboembolic episodes during the transition from paroxysmal AF to chronic AF</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous echo contrast is present during paroxysms of AF, and there is a higher risk of thromboembolism occurring soon after cardioversion from AF to sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart failure by itself confers a risk of stroke and thromboembolism; the risk is additive to that of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5,7,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,24</a>]. A report from the SAVE trial, for example, found a progressive increase in stroke risk during a 42-month follow-up in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; furthermore, every 5 percentage point decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was associated with an 18 percent increase in the risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, there was a significant reduction in longitudinal stroke risk associated with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (relative risk 0.19) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (relative risk 0.44). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a prospective study of 1066 patients entered into three clinical trials evaluating the role of anticoagulation in nonvalvular AF (BAATAF, SPINAF, and SPAF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The incidence of a stroke was 9.3 percent per year in patients with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction, even in the absence of congestive heart failure, compared to 4.4 percent per year in those with normal or mildly abnormal left ventricular function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70244 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The presence of a poorly contracting, dilated left ventricle is likely to promote stasis of blood and lead to an increased risk of intracardiac thrombus formation and subsequent embolism. A left ventricular aneurysm has both diastolic and systolic bulging or dyssynergy which result in severe stasis of blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The incidence of thrombi within left ventricular aneurysms ranges from 14 to 68 percent at postmortem, an observation that is consistent with a 50 to 95 percent incidence at the time of aneurysmectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The reported incidence of systemic embolism in patients with a left ventricular aneurysm ranges widely, from 0 to 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].</p><p>Patients with heart failure, particularly those with a left ventricular aneurysm, also demonstrate abnormalities of blood rheology, coagulation, and endothelial function, suggesting the presence of a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state. As an example, both plasma fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor concentrations may be elevated in heart failure, and platelet abnormalities are evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Since AF also confers a hypercoagulable state, this may be additive to the hemodynamic and hemostatic abnormalities conferred by heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension is a risk factor for stroke (usually thrombotic) and it increases the risk of stroke associated with AF twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6</a>]. How this occurs is unclear. Hypertension may be associated with a hypercoagulable state due in part to abnormalities in blood rheology and endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Valvular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valvular heart disease, especially mitral stenosis, increases the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation 17-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. There is some evidence that the presence of mitral regurgitation is protective against the development of intracardiac thrombi in chronic AF, presumably due to enhanced turbulence and decreased stasis within the left atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, one transesophageal echocardiography study of 169 patients with rheumatic heart disease, 63 percent of whom were in AF, found a preoperative incidence of left atrial spontaneous contrast echo of 1, 30, and 54 percent and of thrombus of 1, 13 and 17 percent for those with mitral regurgitation, combined mitral regurgitation and stenosis, and isolated mitral stenosis, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Further support for this observation comes from a report of 32 patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve repair; atrial indexes of hypercoagulability were significantly lower than peripheral venous levels, consistent with the clinical observations of reduced echo contrast and left atrial thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>These findings correlate with a reduced incidence of embolism in mitral regurgitation. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) study, for example, reported that the annual rate of clinical thromboembolism in patients with an enlarged left atrium and abnormal left ventricular wall motion was lower in those with than in those without mitral regurgitation (7.2 versus 15.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Chronic mitral regurgitation often leads to left atrial dilatation and dysfunction and associated complications. However, even in the presence of left atrial enlargement, severe mitral regurgitation is associated with a lower incidence of embolism (9 versus 25 percent at 7.4 years in those in whom regurgitation was absent or mild) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercoagulable state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies that measured indices of coagulability suggest that AF confers a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of thromboembolism and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3,12,32,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,32,39</a>]. One report of 109 patients with AF fibrillation evaluated the relationship between hemostatic and hemodynamic parameters obtained with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and the presence of left atrial thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared to patients without evidence of thrombus, those with thrombus had spontaneous echo contrast, reduced left atrial appendage velocity, increased plasma concentrations of markers of platelet activation (beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4), increased plasma markers of thrombogenesis (thrombin-antithrombin complexes, D-dimers), and evidence of endothelial <span class=\"nowrap\">damage/dysfunction</span> (elevated plasma and endocardial levels of von Willebrand factor, which is released from damaged endothelium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery endothelial dysfunction: Clinical aspects&quot;</a>.) A multiple logistic model identified left atrial appendage velocity, beta-thromboglobulin, and von Willebrand factor, but not spontaneous echo contrast, as independent associates of left atrial thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Activation of the coagulation system has been identified in other reports of both paroxysmal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] and chronic AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/41-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-47</a>]. This effect is independent of the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease. As noted above, reversion to sinus rhythm results in normalization of hemostatic markers within two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Anticoagulation in patients with AF also alters the hypercoagulable state as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrin D-dimer levels are increased in patients with AF.

The latter effect may stimulate lung macrophages to produce hepatocyte stimulating factor (now known to be interleukin IL-6), increasing the hepatic synthesis of fibrinogen, perhaps in a similar manner to smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Other data suggest that inflammation may contribute to the hypercoagulable state in AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. As an example, high plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) among patients with AF are independently related to indices of the prothrombotic state in AF (eg, CRP to fibrinogen, IL-6 to tissue factor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

However, multivariable analysis suggested that the degree of platelet activation was probably due to the underlying cardiovascular diseases associated with AF rather than the AF itself. Indeed, another marker of platelet activation, soluble CD40 ligand levels, was not related to the risk of stroke nor to prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29446784\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognostic value of elevated biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures of the prothrombotic state in patients with AF, using biomarkers such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) or D-dimer (both of which are discussed in the section above), have been evaluated for their prognostic value.

Many of these factors can be explained by Virchow's triad for thrombogenesis. Consideration must be given to the patient's age, the presence of structural heart disease, and clinical risk factors such as previous hypertension, diabetes, various biomarkers, or heart failure (particularly depressed left ventricular systolic function). In addition, AF appears to be associated with a reversible hypercoagulable state, which complements the clinical and echocardiographic features in explaining the mechanisms of thrombosis in this common disorder.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Virchow R.
