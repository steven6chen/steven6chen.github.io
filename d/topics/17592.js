Although it is considered one of the highly aggressive T cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma variants, the disease course is variable and sometimes quite indolent.</p><p>Four clinical variants of ATL have been described: acute, lymphoma-type (lymphomatous), chronic, and smoldering; these appear to have differing genomic alterations and varying clinical courses, and may require different treatment.</p><p>The treatment of ATL is discussed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, pathology, and diagnosis of ATL are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four clinical variants of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL): acute, lymphoma-type, chronic, and smoldering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These categories differ greatly in their presentation and prognosis. Therapy is usually offered to patients with acute, lymphoma-type, or unfavorable chronic-type ATL while patients with typical chronic or smoldering ATL are observed initially. This is principally because conventional chemotherapy does not appear to improve the survival of patients with chronic or smoldering ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Stratification of patients with chronic and smoldering type ATL into prognostic categories may be useful for identifying those who might benefit from treatment using a risk-adapted therapeutic approach. (See <a href=\"#H25492074\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patients with acute or lymphoma-type ATL have a survival without treatment measured in days to weeks. A brief description of the clinical variants of ATL is given below. This is described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute &ndash; These patients present with systemic symptoms, organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and circulating malignant cells. Survival with treatment is measured in months to a year. Four-year survival rates are approximately 5 to 10 percent and median survival is 8 to 10 months when treated with regimens devised for advanced, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoma-type &ndash; This variant is characterized by prominent lymphadenopathy without blood involvement. Prognosis is poor with a survival similar to that of patients with the acute variant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic &ndash; These patients present with skin lesions, mild lymphadenopathy, and leukocytosis with an absolute lymphocytosis that may be stable for months to years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Median survival is two to five years, however, there is a subgroup of patients with unfavorable chronic-type ATL which is defined by a low serum albumin, high LDH, or high blood urea nitrogen concentration. These patients have a poor prognosis similar to that of the acute and lymphoma variants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoldering &ndash; These patients are often asymptomatic except for frequent skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary lesions. They have normal blood lymphocyte counts with less than 5 percent circulating neoplastic cells and normal calcium levels. Median survival without treatment is approximately three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Prognosis of each of these clinical categories of ATL is discussed below.

In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes including calcium, LDH, albumin, uric acid, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD25. Patients with risk factors should undergo testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow biopsy or aspiration is recommended for all patients. A few reports have described the frequency of bone marrow involvement in various subtypes of ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As an example, in one study from Japan, bone marrow involvement was detected in 60 of 65 patients (92 percent) with the acute type, but only 7 of 40 patients (18 percent) with the lymphoma type of ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture is recommended for all patients with acute or lymphoma-type variants but may be performed at the start of therapy if intrathecal chemotherapy is a component of the treatment regimen. Cerebrospinal fluid should be sent for cytology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flow cytometry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis should be performed. This study provides critical information on the measurement of disease prior to treatment and aids in staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the FDG-avidity of ATL is not well established, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is recommended if it is possible prior to therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Routine imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract with biopsy should be considered for all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although GI tract involvement is more frequent in aggressive variants than indolent variants, a fraction of the latter still have GI tract involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of cardiac ejection fraction (eg, echocardiogram or MUGA) should be performed if anthracyclines are used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men and women of childbearing potential should receive counseling about the potential effect of treatment on their fertility and options for fertility-preserving measures. Given the urgent need for treatment with ATL, options for women are limited, but men can often participate in sperm banking.

Treatment of these variants has been challenging since the tumor cells have an intrinsic resistance to most chemotherapeutic agents and because the patients have an underlying immunocompromised state associated with their HTLV-1 infection. Cell-mediated immunity is impaired in ATL patients while humoral immunity remains intact.</p><p>The greatest experience with ATL comes from the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG). The best treatment for these patients is unclear and patients should be enrolled in clinical trials whenever possible. However, for patients who are not eligible for a clinical trial or for those who do not wish to participate in a trial, we offer the following guidelines. Combination chemotherapy, as described in the next section, is the main treatment option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. When added to conventional therapy, the defucosylated humanized anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab appears to improve response rates and progression-free survival, but is not widely available outside of Japan and may increase the risk of transplant complications. Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) does not appear to be effective. Allogeneic HCT may be appropriate for patients with a related or unrelated donor and may result in long-term disease control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiagent regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal chemotherapy combination for patients with ATL is unclear and many intensive regimens have been investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/3,12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-17</a>]. Patients may initially respond to treatment with combination chemotherapy regimens devised for advanced, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but relapses are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The median survival time for patients with acute, lymphoma-type, or unfavorable chronic-type ATL treated in prospective trials that employed multiagent chemotherapy has ranged from 5 to 13 months.</p><p>Of those evaluated in prospective trials, the regimen that appears to result in the longest median survival is VCAP-AMP-VECP (also known as LSG15), which includes treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, ranimustine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vindesine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vindesine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The use of VCAP-AMP-VECP is supported by prospective phase II and III trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phase III randomized trial of 118 patients with poor prognosis ATL compared six courses of VCAP-AMP-VECP with eight courses of CHOP-14 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> every 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Both groups of patients were given granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support and intrathecal prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and prednisone. At a median follow-up of 10.9 months, the following results were reported:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients treated with VCAP-AMP-VECP had a significantly higher rate of complete response (CR) plus CR unconfirmed compared with those treated with CHOP-14 (40 versus 25 percent, respectively).

Patients received four courses of VCAP-AMP-VECP with or without mogamulizumab (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> administered once every two weeks for a total of eight doses. The addition of mogamulizumab resulted in:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Higher CR (52 versus 33 percent) and overall response (86 versus 75 percent) rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Higher CR rates among those with blood involvement (100 versus 43 percent) or <span class=\"nowrap\">nodal/extranodal</span> disease (92 versus 73 percent) than among those with skin lesions (50 versus 60 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Longer median progression-free survival (PFS; 8.5 versus 6.3 months).

Given a 10 to 25 percent risk for involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) at diagnosis or relapse, we recommend that all patients receive intrathecal chemotherapy for CNS prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The evidence supporting this recommendation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest the use of VCAP-AMP-VECP plus intrathecal chemotherapy rather than other regimens of combination chemotherapy. When available, we suggest the addition of mogamulizumab to VCAP-AMP-VECP. This regimen requires six to eight months of weekly chemotherapy with G-CSF support. The trials supporting the use of this regimen enrolled patients up to the age of 69 years. The ranimustine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vindesine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vindesine</a> used in this regimen are not available in some countries, including the United States. For patients treated by clinicians who do not have access to these agents, one of the acceptable alternative regimens is hyperfractionated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (hyper-CVAD). While hyper-CVAD is frequently used to treat other forms of T cell lymphoma, there are limited data regarding the use of hyper-CVAD for the treatment of ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Although some investigators have reported anecdotal experiences suggesting the efficacy of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, the evidence supporting its efficacy is inadequate, and most patients with aggressive subtypes of ATL cannot be controlled with oral etoposide for a clinically meaningful duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Although the randomized phase II study described above suggested that the addition of mogamulizumab to multiagent chemotherapy improves its anti-tumor efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], several observations after mogamulizumab was approved in Japan suggest an increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease and transplant-related mortality in allogeneic HCT recipients previously treated with mogamulizumab. As an example, in a retrospective review of 996 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for ATL, the use of pretransplant mogamulizumab was associated with an increased risk of severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> graft-versus-host disease (relative risk 1.8), increased non-relapse mortality at one year (44 versus 25 percent), and inferior OS at one year (32 versus 49 percent), especially when it was used within 50 days prior to HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The possibility of these complications must be weighed against the potential benefit when considering the use of mogamulizumab in patients who plan to proceed with allogeneic HCT. This increased risk of graft-versus-host disease may be caused by suppressed effector-type regulatory T cells that express CCR4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Elderly patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously noted, VCAP-AMP-VECP plus intrathecal chemotherapy is associated with significant toxicity. Elderly patients (principally those older than 70 years of age) are less able to tolerate this aggressive regimen. Thus, for patients over 70 years old, we suggest the use of CHOP or CHOP-like regimens, based on the subgroup analysis of the phase III study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Small, prospective trials and retrospective analyses performed outside of Japan have evaluated the use of the antiviral agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> (AZT) plus interferon alfa in the treatment of newly diagnosed or relapsed ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>]. Median survival times with this regimen have ranged from 6 to 18 months. Some of these trials included patients with less aggressive variants of ATL who would be expected to have a good prognosis without any treatment.</p><p>A 2010 meta-analysis of AZT plus interferon alfa incorporated data from 245 patients with acute (47 percent), chronic (7 percent), smoldering (4 percent), or lymphoma-type (42 percent) ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

For patients with chronic or smoldering ATL, this combination was reported to result in 100 percent five-year survival. Based on the results of this retrospective analysis, the investigators suggested this combination regimen as the first-line therapy in leukemic subtypes of ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Although experience is somewhat limited, autologous HCT does not appear to be of benefit due to frequent early relapses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Allogeneic HCT offers a potential graft-versus-leukemia effect and may be considered for patients with an available donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>A number of small non-randomized studies have evaluated the role of myeloablative and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/39,42-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42-48</a>]. Treatment-related mortality was high, although long-term survival was achieved in some patients, with potential evidence of a graft-versus-HTLV-1 and a graft-versus-tumor effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/44,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,49</a>]. After allogeneic HCT, HTLV-1 provirus load was significantly decreased in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/44,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,50</a>], suggesting that anti-HTLV-1 immune response is enhanced in these patients. Phase II studies of nonmyeloablative and myeloablative allogeneic HCT are underway in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/3,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,51,52</a>].</p><p>Retrospective data are available from Japan regarding 586 patients with ATL who underwent allogeneic HCT between 1992 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. For the 280 patients who underwent myeloablative conditioning, median OS and estimated three-year survival were 9.5 months (95% CI 6.7-18.0 months) and 39 percent (33 to 45 percent), respectively. Corresponding values for the 306 patients who underwent reduced intensity conditioning were 10 months (7.2 to 14.0 months) and 34 percent (29 to 40 percent), respectively. When compared with myeloablative conditioning, reduced intensity conditioning was associated with a trend toward less treatment-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.786; 95% CI 0.538-1.148), but greater leukemia-related mortality (HR 1.579; 95% CI 1.080-2.308).</p><p>The disease status at the time of HCT impacts outcome. In a retrospective analysis of 214 Japanese patients with acute or lymphomatous subtypes of ATL who underwent allogeneic HCT, the median survival time was 5.9 months and 26 percent were alive at four years post-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The median survival time was significantly longer for those transplanted in first remission (22 months) when compared with those with primary refractory (4 months) or relapsed disease (3 months).</p><p>Another retrospective analysis included 40 patients with acute or lymphoma-type ATL who had undergone allogeneic HCT either as part of their initial therapy or at relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. All but one of the patients was treated with a myeloablative conditioning regimen. At the time of transplant, 15 were in CR, 13 in partial remission (PR), 3 had stable disease, and 9 had progressive disease. Of the patients evaluable after HCT, all but one achieved a CR. The median survival time of all cases after HCT was 9.6 months. There were 16 deaths related to transplant. The three-year rates of OS and relapse-free survival were 45 and 34 percent, respectively. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease developed in 26 and 15 patients, respectively. Among the 10 patients who relapsed after HCT, five were able to achieve a second CR. Three of these CRs were obtained by reduction or cessation of immunosuppressive therapy alone suggesting a graft-versus-ATL effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) should be evaluated to determine the disease response to treatment and should be followed longitudinally for relapse.</p><p>Patients with ATL are immunocompromised and are therefore at risk for potentially lethal opportunistic infections with organisms such as <em>P. jirovecii</em> (previously <em>P. carinii</em>), <em>Candida</em>, cytomegalovirus, and <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While prophylaxis for such infections is generally given, clinicians need to consider these organisms when patients decompensate.

During this time, we follow patients serially with clinical examination and computed tomography (CT) scans to determine whether the disease is responding as expected. The prospective studies of VCAP-AMP-VECP have not specifically analyzed time to response parameters; however, in our experience, most responders show objective responses during the initial two cycles. This section describes our usual practice when applying this regimen to patients with previously untreated aggressive ATL. </p><p>We perform routine CT scans to evaluate response every two cycles (ie, after two, four, and six cycles). We occasionally perform additional CT scans to confirm progression in patients who show findings suspicious of progressive disease (PD) at other times. PD can be identified clinically in patients with rapidly growing lymph nodes, hypercalcemia, and an apparent increase in peripheral blood tumor cells. Patients with PD after receiving two cycles of induction chemotherapy should be considered for alternative therapies, including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), if a donor is available. &#160;</p><p>If the disease appears to be responding after two cycles, we continue the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen. This includes patients without PD who do not meet the criteria for partial response (ie, categorized as having stable disease). For such patients, we usually continue the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen until apparent PD, partly because there are very few promising regimens other than the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen. Those with residual lymphadenopathy and circulating ATL cells after four to six cycles of therapy are unlikely to attain a complete response with therapy and may be considered for alternative therapies, including allogeneic HCT, if a donor is available.</p><p>The protocols used to evaluate VCAP-AMP-VECP in prospective trials did not provide clinical decision support regarding whether to continue VCAP-AMP-VECP or change the chemotherapy regimen in patients showing stable disease (without evidence of response or progression). As such, clinical decision regarding refractoriness in this setting likely differs among treating physicians. However, this clinical scenario is uncommon since most patients refractory to the VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen manifest with PD rather than long-lasting stable disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Response evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One month following the completion of planned therapy (or sooner if the outcome is unfavorable), the response to treatment should be documented by history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, and biochemical profile). The post-treatment imaging study of choice in patients remains CT. Although PET scans have not been prospectively validated in patients with ATL, we perform a combined <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> if available.</p><p>Using information gathered from the history, physical, and CT scan, disease response is determined using the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) response criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and the normalization of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level for at least four weeks. As carriers of HTLV-1 frequently have abnormal circulating lymphocytes, some abnormal lymphocytes can be present as long as they account for less than 5 percent of the total circulating lymphocytes. Some institutions do not require LDH normalization for the determination of complete response since there are other factors that could lead to its elevation, however, eliminating LDH from the response evaluation may overestimate the response rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial response (PR) is a reduction in measurable disease by at least 50 percent with a more than 75 percent reduction in the absolute abnormal lymphocyte count for at least four weeks without the development of new lesions or disease progression. LDH must have decreased to less than 1.5 of the normal upper limit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive disease (PD) is an at least 50 percent increase in the size of measurable disease or the appearance of new lesions during treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable disease includes those patients not achieving a CR, PR, or PD.</p><p/><p>Patients who fail to obtain a CR are treated as refractory disease.

The frequency and extent of these visits depends upon the comfort of both the patient and physician. There have been no prospective, randomized trials comparing various schedules of follow-up. Our approach is based upon the following general understandings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of relapses occur during the first year after completion of treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapses are usually symptomatic and are rarely identified solely on the basis of routine imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a relapse is picked up a few weeks earlier because of more intense monitoring, it is unlikely to improve outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When planning the post-treatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of CT scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Our approach to patient surveillance is to schedule patient visits monthly during the first year, every two months during the second year, and every three months starting two years after CR. At these visits, we perform a history and physical examination, complete blood count with differential, evaluation of the peripheral smear, chemistries, LDH, and flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>It is recommended that relapsed disease suggested by changes on imaging be confirmed by biopsy. As such, a biopsy is recommended to document relapsed disease before proceeding to salvage therapy.</p><p>In some patients with ATL relapse occurs as the appearance of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood alone. In addition, it is sometimes difficult to recognize leukemic cells by morphology alone. In such situations, flow cytometry of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, especially evaluating the T4:T8 ratio, is easily performed and effective for estimating the leukemic cell kinetics in the peripheral blood. In particular, since ATL cells show a characteristic phenotype that is both CD4 and CD25 positive, flow cytometry can be performed in most cases to identify leukemic cells in the peripheral blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RECURRENT OR REFRACTORY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little information on the treatment of recurrent or refractory adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) and patients should be referred for enrollment in clinical trials. Although not widely available outside of Japan, mogamulizumab is well tolerated and active in this setting. Other areas of investigation include the use of antiviral agents or antibody therapy. Patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may respond to withdrawal of immunosuppression or immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Small studies of these and other approaches are described here. The use of antiviral therapy is discussed above.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pretreatment evaluation both determines the bulk of disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform laboratory studies, unilateral bone marrow biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aspiration, lumbar puncture, cardiac function evaluation, and imaging in all patients. Fertility counseling should be offered to patients in childbearing years. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best treatment for these patients is unclear and patients should be enrolled in clinical trials whenever possible. However, for patients who are not eligible for a clinical trial or for those who do not wish to participate in a trial, we offer the following guidelines:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients with acute, lymphoma-type, or unfavorable chronic type ATL require treatment. We recommend that these patients also receive intrathecal chemotherapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the use of VCAP-AMP-VECP rather than other regimens of combination chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). When available, we also suggest the addition of the defucosylated humanized anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab to VCAP-AMP-VECP rather than the administration of VCAP-AMP-VECP alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For those who plan to proceed with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the decision to add mogamulizumab must take into consideration a potentially increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease and transplant-related mortality. Data regarding the use of antiviral therapy for acute and chronic variants are insufficient. Some agents contained in VCAP-AMP-VECP and mogamulizumab are not available in some countries, including the United States. For patients treated by clinicians that do not have access to these agents, one of the acceptable alternative regimens is hyperfractionated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (hyper-CVAD), although its evidence is limited. For older patients or those with comorbidities that exclude VCAP-AMP-VECP as an option, we suggest the use of CHOP or CHOP-like regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Multiagent regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Allogeneic HCT offers a potential graft-versus-leukemia effect and may be considered for patients with an available donor. Administration of mogamulizumab should be avoided before HCT. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physicians preparing to treat patients with ATL need to be aware that hypercalcemia is a frequent complication and that there is a significant risk of tumor lysis syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-renal-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid renal diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment#H21712100\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment of established TLS'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After completion of the initially planned treatment of ATL, patients should be evaluated to determine the disease response to treatment and should be followed longitudinally for relapse. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Patient follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ATL are immunocompromised and are therefore at risk for potentially lethal opportunistic infections with organisms such as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (previously <em>P. carinii</em>), <em>Candida</em>, cytomegalovirus, and <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strongyloidiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strongyloidiasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diagnostic tests for cytomegalovirus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-candida-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Candida infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is little information on the treatment of recurrent or refractory ATL and patients should be referred for enrollment in clinical trials whenever possible. Although not widely available outside of Japan, mogamulizumab is well tolerated and active in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of recurrent or refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155541412\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate would like to acknowledge Kensei Tobinai, MD, PhD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ravandi F, O'Brien S.
