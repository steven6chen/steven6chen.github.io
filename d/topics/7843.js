Ask your doctors and nurses these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why did I have to stay in the hospital?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which new medicines do I need to take now?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which of my old medicines do I need to keep taking?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When should I see my regular doctor, and what information should I give my regular doctor about this hospital stay?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What warning signs should I look for that could mean my problem is coming back or getting worse?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whom can I call with questions?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do I need to change my diet or lifestyle?</p><p/><p>Each of these issues is discussed in more detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11897065\"><span class=\"h1\">Reason for hospital stay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people leave the hospital without really understanding why they were there in the first place. Before you leave, be sure to find out the reason for your hospital stay. Find out:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What the doctors learned about your condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What the doctors did to treat your condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If it was a new problem or was related to a health problem you already had</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11897072\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people leave the hospital with a bunch of new prescriptions. Sometimes they stay on medicines they were taking before. Sometimes they go off medicines they were taking before.</p><p>When you are still at the hospital, ask for a list of all the medicines you will need to take when you go home. Ask how your medicines have changed since you got to the hospital and why. It is especially important to ask whether you should take the new medicines <strong>along with</strong> the old ones, or whether you should take the new medicines <strong>instead</strong> of the old ones.</p><p>If you think you might have any problems getting your prescriptions filled or paying for your medicines, mention these issues to your doctor or nurse at the hospital. There are often ways to deal with these problems, but you need to let someone on the hospital staff know.</p><p>All medicines have at least 2 names, a brand name and a generic name. Be sure to ask for both the brand and generic names of the medicines you must take. People sometimes accidentally take the same medicine twice, because they have a bottle with the generic name and a bottle with the brand name, and they think the bottles contain different medicines when they are really the same. Usually, the brand and generic medicines don't even look the same. The pills are a different shape or color, so it's easy to get confused. This can be dangerous.</p><p>When you see your regular doctor after coming home from the hospital, ask him or her to go over your medicines with you again. It's very important that you understand what you are on and why. Hopefully you can use the list of medicines you got from the hospital. But if for some reason you do not have a list, create one with the help of your regular doctor or pharmacist. You can find an example of this kind of list at the following website: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/ucm079489.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IOhw8tWkhkVaWidZQDUIbu9gDMhwPSip8u9zifYOMQtFzUgxleN7AXwBD6pfdpaGrA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16428\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm</a>. The list will come in handy whenever you need to let doctors or nurses know which medicines you take.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11897079\"><span class=\"h1\">Follow-up visits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you leave the hospital, it's very important that you have a follow-up visit with a doctor or nurse. You might need to see one of your regular doctors or nurses. Or you might need to see a surgeon or specialist who treated you at the hospital.</p><p>While you are still at the hospital, find out who to go to for your follow-up care. Sometimes the hospital staff will make an appointment for you before you go home. But if that doesn't happen, make an appointment yourself.</p><p>When you call to make the appointment, explain that you've just gotten out of the hospital and that you need a follow-up visit right away. Make sure that the doctor or nurse doing your follow-up care knows which hospital you stayed in. That way he or she can try to get a copy of your medical records before your appointment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11897086\"><span class=\"h1\">Warning signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most medical conditions that can land you in the hospital when you weren't expecting it cause certain symptoms before they get really bad. These symptoms or warning signs are sometimes called &quot;red flags.&quot; They are your body's way of telling you that something is wrong. If you learn to recognize and pay attention to these warning signs, you might be able to stop these problems before they get too serious.</p><p>Ask your doctor or nurse which symptoms should get your attention. Also ask what you should do if they happen. Depending on the warning sign, you might need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take extra medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call the doctor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11897093\"><span class=\"h1\">Contact at the hospital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you're home from the hospital, it's sometimes hard to easily reach somebody who knows all about your care during your stay. That's why it's a good idea to ask for the contact information of someone at the hospital before you leave. That way, if you have any questions about your time at the hospital, you know whom to ask. This is especially important if you have not gotten all your test results back by the time you leave the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11897100\"><span class=\"h1\">Diet and lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on what medical conditions you have, the foods you eat and the way you live might have a big impact on your health. If you have heart failure, for example, eating too much salt (sodium) can land you back in the hospital. And if you had a stroke or a heart attack, quitting smoking greatly reduces the chance that you will have another heart attack or stroke. Before you leave the hospital, find out what lifestyle changes you should make.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11897229\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
