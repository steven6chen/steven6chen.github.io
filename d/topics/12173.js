However, cancer survivors prescribed bone-modifying agents, survivors of head and neck cancer, childhood cancer survivors, and patients treated on protocols involving high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation (HCT-SCT) constitute high-risk groups for oral health complications. These patients may require long-term dental follow-up well after completion of cancer therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An overview of oral complications is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85779\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85779 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Since most patients are usually followed and managed by their local community dentists, communication between medical and dental providers is critical prior, during, and after cancer therapy, in order to minimize or prevent oral health complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review oral health considerations in cancer survivors at high risk for complications.

As a result, a number of complications can arise that impact the oral cavity directly and the surrounding organs (eg, thyroid gland) and structures. These include facial disfigurement, salivary gland hypofunction, osteoradionecrosis, and trismus. In addition, these patients are at risk for both recurrence and a second primary lesion.

For these patients, chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) to the head and neck region can have an adverse impact on normal growth and development of teeth and surrounding structures.</p><p>Abnormal findings include smaller than normal teeth (microdontia) and failure of the teeth to develop (hypodontia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In one study involving 150 children, the prevalence of microdontia and hypodontia were 19 and 9 percent (compared with 0 and 4 percent among 193 age-matched controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H99498948\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal dental development'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment-related risk factors for oral complications were identified in a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this study, 8522 cancer survivors and 2831 of their siblings responded to questionnaires and an interview about oral health. The median age at cancer diagnosis was six years and median time from diagnosis to interview was 22 years. The majority of cancer survivors reported prior treatment with chemotherapy (76 percent) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (64 percent). Risk factors associated with at least one dental problem included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RT dose to the jaw &ndash; A total dose &lt;20 Gy was associated with a 1.3-fold higher risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.5), while a total dose &ge;20 Gy was associated with a nearly sixfold increase in risk (OR 5.6, 95% CI 3.7-8.5).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total dose of alkylating agents &ndash; The risk increased with increasing cumulative dose of alkylating drugs administered.

When there are complications affecting growth and development, patients may require the expertise of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, orthodontists, and prosthodontists for comprehensive management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248884016\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic graft-versus-host disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy (HCT) followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT-SCT) are at an increased risk for oral health complications if they develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), particularly for the development of dental caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Oral complications affect more than 80 percent of patients with GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although patients who undergo an autologous SCT are at risk of acute complications (eg, mucositis and infection) immediately following transplantation, following immune reconstitution, there are no specific associated late oral complications. (See <a href=\"#H99499233\" class=\"local\">'Oral chronic graft-versus-host disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with GVHD often require extended immunosuppressive therapy, putting them at long-term risk of oral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These patients are also at an increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, likely due to a combination of chronic inflammation associated with GVHD, as well as long-term immunosuppression.

The primary objective is to identify any actively infected teeth so that they can be treated definitively prior to the initiation of cancer-related therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. This is especially important for high risk patients as discussed above because dental extractions are a well-recognized risk factor for complications including osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients being treated with bone-modifying agents and osteoradionecrosis following radiation therapy (RT) in head and neck cancer survivors.

Secondary infection of the surrounding soft tissue is common, presenting with painful erythema, swelling, and purulence. Some patients with ONJ may also present with complaints of dysesthesia or paresthesia in the affected area due to inflammatory or infectious involvement of the neurovascular bundle around the necrotic bone, or due to increased bone deposition and narrowing of the nerve canal. A clinical staging system for ONJ developed by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons can be helpful in categorizing patients based on severity of symptoms and need for treatment.

Radiographic features of ONJ include mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">radiopaque/radiolucent</span> lesions, often with a mottled appearance. In more advanced cases, osteolytic changes can extend to the inferior border of the mandible. In most cases intraoral and panoramic radiography are sufficient; however, in cases of suspected pathological fractures, computed tomography (CT) scans may be indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

It is commonly precipitated by an injury (surgery, dental extractions, poor dentition, or infection) to hypoxic bone tissue. Symptoms of osteoradionecrosis can include pain, bad breath, dysgeusia, dysesthesia or anesthesia, trismus, difficulty with chewing and swallowing, speech difficulties, fistula formation, pathologic fracture, and infection. In some cases, it may be diagnosed shortly after completion of RT, while in other patients it may not be diagnosed for years after the original cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

However, when bone and soft tissue necrosis are extensive, resection of the mandible with immediate microvascular reconstruction may provide better results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-health-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Many dentists prescribe hyperbaric oxygen to treat or prevent osteoradionecrosis. However, its use is generally governed by institutional guidelines. For any patient with osteoradionecrosis, recurrent cancer must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of exposed mandible or maxilla.

The most basic approaches involve using two hands to stretch the jaw passively (completely relaxed) or stacking tongue depressors into the oral cavity.

However, cancer survivors prescribed bone-modifying agents, survivors of head and neck cancer, childhood cancer survivors, and patients treated on protocols involving high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation (HCT-SCT) constitute high-risk groups for oral health complications.

Oral chronic GVHD also places patients at risk for recurrent infections (due to prolonged immunosuppression).
