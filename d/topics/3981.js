The term &quot;miliary&quot; was coined in 1700 by John Jacobus Manget, who likened the appearance of the involved lung to millet seeds, with its surface covered with small, firm white nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76174 \">picture 1</a>). The term miliary TB was originally a pathologic and then a radiographic description; it is now used to denote all forms of progressive, widely disseminated hematogenous TB. The term also may be used more broadly (and incorrectly) by some to denote involvement at multiple sites, whether or not disease presents with the classic radiographic or pathologic nodular appearance characteristic of hematogenous spread. Miliary TB can arise as a result of progressive primary infection or via reactivation of a latent focus with subsequent spread via the bloodstream. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of miliary TB will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of miliary and extrapulmonary TB are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathology of miliary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of miliary tuberculosis (TB) are most likely to be subacute or chronic; less commonly, acute presentations also occur. Patients with subacute or chronic disease may present with failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], fever of unknown origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysfunction of one or more organ systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Night sweats are frequent; rigors are unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In one series including 38 patients, the median duration of illness prior to clinical presentation was two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common extrapulmonary sites include the lymphatic system, bones and joints, liver, central nervous system (CNS), and adrenal glands.</p><p>Acute miliary TB may be fulminant, including multiorgan system failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], a syndrome of septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Miliary TB is a relatively rare cause of acute respiratory failure and ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]; one study in South Africa (where the prevalence of TB is very high) noted approximately 2 percent of cases of ARDS were associated with disseminated TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The diagnosis of TB is more likely to be delayed or missed in patients presenting with acute respiratory failure rather than more typical symptoms of pulmonary or pleural TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients who develop miliary TB during primary infection can present with relatively acute onset and rapid clinical course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and complications of pulmonary tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms and signs of miliary TB are described in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60000\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60000 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63136 \">table 2</a>). Much of the data on clinical features of miliary TB comes from large retrospective series (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77719\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77719 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/1,2,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,16-19</a>]. These studies include a relatively large number of patients though differ markedly by year, inclusion criteria, country, and type of medical center; therefore, direct comparisons are difficult.</p><p>Pulmonary disease has been observed in more than 50 percent of patients with miliary TB in most series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Patients with miliary TB that involves the lungs may have dyspnea or cough and rales or rhonchi on physical examination; hypoxemia is common. Pleuritic chest pain with accompanying pleural rub or other signs of a pleural effusion have also been well described.</p><p>Autopsy series of miliary TB describe seeding of every organ in the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of liver involvement in disseminated TB include diffuse abdominal pain or pain localizing to the right upper quadrant, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Cholestatic jaundice in miliary TB is also well described. Rarely, fulminant hepatic failure can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Liver function test abnormalities are common; one series noted elevated alkaline phosphatase and transaminases in 83 and 42 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Histopathologic sections of involved liver demonstrate scattered granulomatous lesions that, on gross examination, have the appearance of millet seeds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83409\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83409 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system lesions may occur diffusely throughout the brain and usually are not centered around the ventricles or basal cisterns (as seen in TB meningitis). In one series, meningeal involvement was evident postmortem in 54 percent of cases of miliary TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In another study including seven patients with radiographic pulmonary miliary TB and no clinical CNS findings, all had brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Overt adrenal insufficiency is less common, occurring in 1 percent of reported cases of miliary TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26</a>]. In a prospective study including 30 patients with miliary TB, adrenal function was abnormal in one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Another series including 55 patients with TB involvement of the adrenal gland noted 12 percent presented with clinical manifestations of Addison's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Mycobacteria can reach the liver by hematogenous dissemination (miliary) or by local spread from the gastrointestinal tract or the abdomen. A systematic review including 618 cases of hepatic TB noted miliary disease accounted for 79 percent of hepatic TB, usually accompanied by lung involvement; focal disease, including abscess formation or biliary tract TB, accounted for the remaining 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Presenting findings described in 11 case series included hepatomegaly, fever, respiratory symptoms, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Imaging by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound confirms liver involvement but is not specific for diagnosis.</p><p>Tuberculous peritonitis usually develops following spread of infection from adjacent organs or by hematogenous spread in miliary disease. It should be suspected in patients at risk for TB who present with ascites. Symptoms of fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain are common. Ascites fluid usually demonstrates lymphocytosis, elevated protein, and elevated inflammatory markers. Culture of ascites fluid or of peritoneal tissue is required to confirm the diagnosis. The surface of the peritoneum may demonstrate focal granulomatous lesions on visual examination that may appear like miliary disease; biopsy of these lesions demonstrates caseating granulomas with or without acid-fast staining organisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Central nervous system disease, such as meningitis or tuberculoma, was observed in 15 to 20 percent of patients with TB in two large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Among patients with tuberculous meningitis, about one-third to one-half in one series had miliary TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a study of seven patients with miliary pulmonary TB and no neurologic findings, all patients had evidence of CNS disease by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Other manifestations of miliary TB include laryngitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], otitis media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and thyroid involvement with clinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of miliary TB is often missed due to the nonspecific nature of the presentation. In one United States review, approximately 20 percent of miliary TB cases were diagnosed postmortem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Among HIV-infected patients in Africa, previously unrecognized disseminated tuberculosis has been identified at autopsy in as many as 40 percent of hospital deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many laboratory abnormalities may be observed in miliary tuberculosis (TB) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76492 \">table 4</a>). Hematologic abnormalities are prominent. Normocytic, normochromic anemia is seen in approximately one-half of the patients in most series. Most patients have a normal white blood cell count, but leukopenia and leukocytosis occur in a minority of patients with roughly equal frequency. Leukemoid reactions are also described and may be mistaken for leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Monocytosis occurs but is less common. Thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis are also reported.</p><p>Pancytopenia, which should raise concern for miliary TB, may be due to marrow infiltration alone or may be a manifestation of an underlying hematologic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Cases of the histiocytic hemophagocytic syndrome associated with miliary TB have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Overt disseminated intravascular coagulation is rare; it has been described in acute, fulminant disease. Milder coagulation abnormalities have been described more frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and other acute-phase reactants are elevated in the majority of patients with miliary TB. Polyclonal gammaglobulinemia is also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Hyponatremia may be observed; it is presumed to be due to the same problems with regulation of antidiuretic hormone seen in other pulmonary processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hypercalcemia is rare but may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

More than two-thirds of patients with the diagnosis of disseminated TB had a chest radiograph with a miliary pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic appearance in miliary disease is a faint, reticulonodular infiltrate distributed fairly uniformly throughout the lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63302\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63302 \">image 1</a>). This miliary pattern may become apparent days or weeks after presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/16,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,19</a>]. This finding is thought to reflect nodular interstitial spread without significant alveolar involvement, although it has been demonstrated that, by the time the miliary nodules are large enough to be appreciated on a plain chest radiograph, they typically involve the adjacent alveoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Conversely, pathologic conditions that initially involve alveoli, such as alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, or inhalational diseases, can appear initially as small nodules. These so-called &quot;acinar nodules&quot; are described as larger (5 to 10 mm) and more heterogeneous than classic miliary TB, but overlap occurs, making the appearance of many of these conditions indistinguishable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The differential diagnosis of a miliary chest radiography pattern is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70568\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70568 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>Other chest radiograph abnormalities include pleural reactions, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, and other evidence of active or healed parenchymal TB (interstitial or alveolar infiltrates or cavities). A miliary pattern can be seen in addition to non-miliary disease. Normal chest radiographs may be observed in up to one-half of patients with disseminated TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Numerous 2 to 3 mm nodules can be visualized distributed throughout the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77071\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77071 \">image 2</a>). Septal thickening usually accompanies these nodules. These findings are sensitive but not necessarily specific for miliary TB. In series correlating clinical and pathologic findings with HRCT, disseminated nodules were found in many other infections (<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, <em>Candida albicans</em>) and noninfectious diseases (sarcoidosis, metastatic adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, amyloidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pneumoconiosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Other nonspecific findings on chest CT can be observed in miliary TB. As an example, in one study, ground-glass opacities covering &gt;50 percent of the lung field were seen in 20 percent of patients with miliary TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90644925\"><span class=\"h2\">Positron emission tomography CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) computed tomography (CT) is becoming more widely used for the evaluation of malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Uptake of FDG is proportional to glycolysis within inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, activated macrophages, and lymphocytes as well as tumor cells, and regions of high uptake can be seen at sites of inflammation or infection such as in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Miliary TB can arise as a result of progressive primary infection or via reactivation of a latent focus with subsequent spread. The clinical presentation of miliary TB is highly variable; manifestations can be acute but are more likely to be subacute or chronic. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute disease may be fulminant, including multiorgan system failure, a syndrome of septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with subacute or chronic disease may present with failure to thrive, fever of unknown origin, or dysfunction of one or more organ systems. Symptoms generally are related to the site(s) of disease involvement. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common sites of involvement include the lungs, the lymphatic system, bones and joints, liver, central nervous system, and adrenal glands. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common laboratory abnormalities include anemia and other hematologic findings. Other laboratory abnormalities may include elevated acute-phase reactants, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, and sterile pyuria. In miliary disease, the classic chest radiograph appearance is a faint, reticulonodular infiltrate distributed fairly uniformly throughout the lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63302\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63302 \">image 1</a>). Other chest radiograph abnormalities include pleural reactions, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, interstitial or alveolar infiltrates, or cavities. Computed tomography of the chest is more sensitive for evaluation of miliary TB than plain chest radiography. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical evaluation for miliary TB begins with a thorough history and physical examination, including a dilated funduscopic examination. In general, evaluation for pulmonary disease and mycobacterial blood cultures are warranted in all patients in whom disseminated TB is being considered. In regions where available, molecular tests can be useful rapid diagnostic tools. (See <a href=\"#H13124464\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subsequent diagnostic evaluation should be tailored to localizing signs or symptoms of disease involvement. Patients with neurologic signs or symptoms should undergo neuroimaging and lumbar puncture (if feasible and not contraindicated). In the setting of pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites, fluid should be obtained for evaluation and a biopsy strongly considered. Radiographic imaging of the involved site(s) may be warranted for patients with symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, <span class=\"nowrap\">bones/joints,</span> or lymph nodes. Suspected genitourinary disease should prompt urine acid-fast bacillus culture. Depending on the involved site(s), tissue biopsy may be required to establish a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H13124464\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy specimens allow for both histopathologic examination and acid-fast culture. Biopsy sites with relatively good yield include the pleura, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and transbronchial biopsies; the yield is likely to be increased in the setting of associated clinical or laboratory abnormalities. Histopathology typically demonstrates granulomatous inflammation. Tuberculous granulomas characteristically contain epithelioid macrophages, Langhans giant cells, and lymphocytes, and the centers often have characteristic caseation (&quot;cheese-like&quot;) necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H13124590\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the approach to antimicrobial therapy for treatment of miliary TB is the same as for pulmonary TB, although modifications may be warranted in the setting of drug-resistant TB. In addition, longer duration of therapy may be warranted for children, immunocompromised hosts, patients with a large organism burden, and patients with a slow microbiologic or clinical response. Longer duration of therapy is also warranted for patients with disease involving the central nervous system, some patients with bone or joint disease, and some cases of lymphadenitis. Surgical intervention may be needed for diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> therapeutic management in some cases. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Proudfoot AT, Akhtar AJ, Douglas AC, Horne NW.
