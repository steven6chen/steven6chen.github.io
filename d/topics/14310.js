Careful evaluation for underlying causes is important for these uncommon types of headache.</p><p>This topic will review primary cough headache. Other types of uncommon primary headache disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-stabbing-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary stabbing headache&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exertional-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exertional headache&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary headache associated with sexual activity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypnic-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypnic headache&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thunderclap headache&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nummular-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nummular headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes referred to as benign cough headache or Valsalva maneuver headache, primary cough headache is provoked by coughing or straining in the absence of any intracranial disorder.</p><p>Primary cough headache most often affects people over the age of 40. Cough headaches are sudden in onset, bilateral in distribution, and last from seconds to 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These headaches are not associated with nausea, vomiting, light or sound sensitivity, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, or lacrimation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The true prevalence and incidence of primary cough headache is unknown, but one Danish population-based study found that the lifetime prevalence of benign cough headache was 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headaches provoked by coughing may occur either as a benign primary headache disorder or as a secondary headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Structural lesions should be ruled out with neuroimaging before making the diagnosis of primary cough headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>Several structural lesions have been associated with cough headache, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chiari type 1 malformations with or without syringomyelia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior fossa lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unruptured cerebral aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial hypervolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial low pressure state (with positional headaches) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral carotid artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrode implantation in the periaqueductal gray [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p/><p>Limited evidence suggests that secondary etiologies are present in approximately one-half of patients who have cough-provoked headaches. In one series that included 30 patients who presented with headaches precipitated by coughing, the headaches were secondary to another cause in 17 patients (57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. All 17 had a Chiari type I malformation, with cerebellar tonsillar descent of &gt;3 mm below the foramen magnum by MRI. Fourteen of these patients also had signs or symptoms related to the posterior <span class=\"nowrap\">fossa/foramen</span> magnum region, and five had evidence of syringomyelia.</p><p>Given these data, we suggest a neuroimaging evaluation, preferably with a contrast-enhanced brain MRI, for all patients presenting with de novo headache precipitated by coughing. We recommend such an evaluation for patients with posterior fossa symptoms or signs. In addition, we recommend a neurovascular evaluation (using CT or MR angiography) of the intracranial and extracranial vessels if the patient has a recent history of unilateral cough-provoked headache with contralateral transient focal neurologic symptoms.</p><p>A few of the secondary causes of cough-provoked headache are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unruptured intracranial aneurysms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinguishing primary and secondary forms of cough headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical differences may help distinguish between benign primary cough headache and secondary cough headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These differences include a longer typical duration for secondary cough headache than for the primary form (under one minute for benign headaches versus seconds to days for secondary headaches), and the presence of posterior fossa signs or symptoms in secondary cough headache.</p><p>A response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> is more typical for primary cough headache than for secondary forms. However, the lack of response to indomethacin is probably not reliable as a sole distinguishing feature for secondary cough headache, since the cough headache associated with Chiari I malformation may respond to indomethacin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In addition, headaches that occur in the context of other primary disorders, such as migraine, cluster headache, and hemicrania continua, may be intensified by coughing or Valsalva maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The presence of associated symptoms suggestive of other primary headache disorders allows them to be distinguished from primary cough headache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinguishing cough headache and exertional headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because Valsalva maneuvers frequently occur in the context of many forms of physical exertion, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish primary cough headache from primary exertional headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exertional-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exertional headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, several clinical differences between benign cough and benign exertional headache have been identified that aid in distinguishing the two disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough headache is triggered by Valsalva maneuvers, while exertional headache is triggered by more sustained physical exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average age of patients afflicted with benign cough headache is 67 (&plusmn; 11), while the average age of patients with benign exertional headache is 24 (&plusmn; 11)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cough headache typically has a faster onset than benign exertional headache, which builds up over minutes or longer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cough headaches are shorter than benign exertional headaches</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cough headaches are typically sharp and stabbing in quality while benign exertional headaches are described as pulsatile</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of primary cough headache is poorly understood. One postulated mechanism is that coughing induces sudden increases in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures that are transmitted through the valveless venous system into the intracranial venous sinus system, causing activation of intradural or perivascular nociceptive neurons.</p><p>In support of this hypothesis, one investigator measured cerebrospinal fluid pressure from the lumbar region and the cisterna magna during coughing in 16 patients requiring cervical myelography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. None of the cases were found to have complete blockage of the spinal subarachnoid space. During a cough, there was a phase during which the lumbar pressure exceeded the cisternal, followed by a phase in which the cisternal pressure exceeded the lumbar. Thus, on coughing, the intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure caused a pressure wave that was transmitted into the head and then rapidly downwards again [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>These studies suggest that the upward passage of fluid from the spine towards the head is relatively unimpeded, but that the downward rebound from the head towards the spine is sufficient to cause tissue to jam in the foramen magnum. This creates a pressure gradient between the head and spine, termed the &quot;craniospinal pressure dissociation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, cough and Valsalva maneuvers that occur in the course of daily life are usually insufficient to activate intracranial nociceptive fibers, suggesting that patients with cough headache have some factor (or factors) that lowers activation thresholds and results in recurrent depolarization of the nociceptive fibers.</p><p>One study found stenotic abnormalities on magnetic resonance venography in 5 of 7 patients with primary cough headache, compared with 0 of 16 headache-free control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This finding suggests that venous outflow obstruction could be a promoting factor in some patients with primary cough headache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for spontaneous recovery is fair at best. In the first reported series of 21 cases, nine had spontaneous recovery within 18 months to 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Two additional patients had improvement after lumbar puncture. Another two had relief after tooth extraction. The remaining patients continued to have cough headache until they were lost to follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, any pulmonary disease causing chronic coughing should be identified and treated if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of choice for primary cough headache is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>. A small, double-blind, controlled study found that indomethacin (150 mg daily) was effective treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In other series, indomethacin doses up to 250 mg per day have been required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indomethacin</a> decreases intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and that may be why it is effective in this condition as compared with other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Because of the strong potential for gastrointestinal irritation with chronic indomethacin use, the addition of a proton pump inhibitor is probably prudent in those patients requiring long-term indomethacin treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients may lose their tendency for cough headache with time, suggesting that periodic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> withdrawal after six to 12 months of therapy is also wise.</p><p>Other medications reported to be effective for primary cough headache in open-label trials or case series include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], methysergide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergonovine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergonovine</a>, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dihydroergotamine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In addition to medical therapy, several authors have reported occasional benefit from cerebrospinal fluid removal by lumbar puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/18,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27</a>]. One author reported that patients who have been unresponsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> may improve after high volume (40 mL) cerebrospinal fluid removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cough-headache/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cough headache most often affects people older than age 40 and is provoked by coughing or straining in the absence of any intracranial disorder.
