People with diabetes (sometimes called &quot;diabetes mellitus&quot;) can get nerve damage if they have high blood sugar levels for a long time. Another word for nerve damage is &quot;neuropathy.&quot;</p><p>People with diabetes can get different types of nerve damage. This article covers the most common type of nerve damage caused by diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727895166\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of nerve damage caused by diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve damage usually affects the toes and feet first. Some people do not feel any symptoms, but other people can have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or loss of feeling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or pain, which is often worse at rest or at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tingling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling light touches as bothersome or painful</p><p/><p>As nerve damage gets worse, symptoms can move from the feet up the legs. Some people might also start to feel symptoms in their hands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727895173\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for nerve damage caused by diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor can usually tell if you have nerve damage by talking with you and doing an exam. Sometimes, a doctor will do a test to check how well a person's nerves are working. This test is called &quot;electromyography.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727895180\"><span class=\"h1\">How does nerve damage lead to problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve damage can lead to problems because it can make people unable to feel pain in their feet.</p><p>Normally, people feel pain when they get a cut on their foot. The pain tells them that they need to treat their cut so that it can heal. But people with nerve damage might not feel any pain when their feet get hurt. They might not even know that they have a cut, so they might not treat it. Problems that aren't treated right away can get much worse. For example, an untreated cut can get infected and turn into an open sore.</p><p>Nerve damage can also lead to problems with the bones, muscles, and joints in the feet. Over time, this can cause a person's foot to have an abnormal shape.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727895187\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to protect my feet and manage my condition?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control your blood sugar levels &ndash; Symptoms of pain and burning sometimes get better when blood sugar levels are under control. To better control your blood sugar, your doctor might prescribe another diabetes medicine or recommend that you take your diabetes medicine more often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take special care of your feet &ndash; Taking care of your feet can prevent future problems. It can also prevent a mild problem from turning into a serious one. To protect and take care of your feet, you can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wear shoes or slippers all the time. Never go barefoot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trim your toe nails carefully. Cut straight across and file the nail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80053 \">figure 1</a>). Do not cut cuticles or pop blisters. Ask your doctor to do any procedures that could involve cutting the skin, such as removing an ingrown toenail.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wash your feet with warm water and soap every day and pat them dry. Put a moisturizing cream or lotion on the tops and bottoms of your feet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Check both feet every day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77032 \">figure 2</a>). Look for cuts, blisters, swelling, or redness. Make sure to check all over your feet, including in between your toes. If you cannot see the bottoms of your feet, use a mirror or ask another person to check.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wear socks that are not too tight, and change them every day. Wear shoes that fit well, but are not too tight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79305 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Check inside your shoes before you put them on. Make sure there is nothing sharp inside.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727895194\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatment might I have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people might have other treatment for symptoms or problems caused by nerve damage. They might have treatment for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain &ndash; Doctors can prescribe different medicines to treat pain that is caused by nerve damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foot problems &ndash; Doctors can treat foot problems that occur. There are different treatments, depending on how serious the problem is. For example, a doctor might do one or more of the following to treat an open sore:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clean the sore and remove any dead skin around it</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prescribe antibiotic medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do surgery to remove a toe or part of the foot</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727895201\"><span class=\"h1\">How often should my doctor check my feet?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor should do a complete check of your feet once a year. He or she should also do a quick check of your feet at every visit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727895208\"><span class=\"h1\">Can nerve damage be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe, but doctors don't know for sure. If you have diabetes, some studies suggest you can reduce your risk of getting nerve damage by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping your blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight, if you are overweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making sure that your high blood pressure and heart disease are treated (if you have these conditions)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727895215\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathic-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neuropathic pain (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetic neuropathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=foot-care-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Foot care in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
