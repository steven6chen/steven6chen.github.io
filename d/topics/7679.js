It is common for patients with these symptoms to present to health professionals repeatedly, with pressing but long-standing concerns that prove to be medically unexplained. </p><p>The nature of excessive and persistent worrying has not been investigated extensively.

Longitudinal studies in treatment-seeking patients generally provide evidence for a prolonged and fluctuating course of illness. A prospective study of 179 patients with generalized anxiety disorder (DSM-III-R) in the US found that approximately 60 percent of patients recovered over 12 years (ie, had no more than residual symptoms for eight consecutive weeks), but around one-half of recovered patients subsequently relapsed during the 12 year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] The decline in mean anxiety symptom severity in the patients with GAD was only modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466010952\"><span class=\"h2\">Onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GAD typically has a gradual onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] with emergence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] of the full syndromal disorder later than some other anxiety disorders.

The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (eg, anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder). Because the majority of the anxiety symptoms are not specific to GAD, it is important to exclude the other anxiety disorders before making the diagnosis.

Individuals with depression tend to brood self-critically on previous events and circumstances, whereas patients with GAD tend to worry about possible future events. Symptoms of depression such as early morning awakening, diurnal variation in mood, and suicidal thoughts are all uncommon in GAD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601612651\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypochondriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concern about medically unexplained symptoms is common to both GAD and hypochondriasis, but GAD is usually characterized by worries about multiple different things, while patients with hypochondriasis worry principally about illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601612658\"><span class=\"h3\">Panic disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Panic attacks can occur in GAD, arising out of escalating and uncontrollable worry: but the presence of unexpected (uncued) panic attacks is unusual in GAD.

(See <a href=\"#H448541396\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GAD is common in community and clinical settings. It is probably the most common anxiety disorder in people aged over 65 years. Major depression and other anxiety disorders are common comorbidities of GAD. (See <a href=\"#H448541403\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic factors appear to predispose individuals to the development of GAD, though data from twin studies have been inconsistent. GAD shares a common heritability with major depression and with the personality trait of &ldquo;neuroticism.&rdquo; Adversity and undesirable life events can exacerbate symptoms of GAD. Neuroimaging and other studies suggest the symptoms of GAD are accompanied by an enhanced emotional responsiveness in fear-related brain circuits. (See <a href=\"#H448541410\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive and persistent worrying is the pathognomic symptom of GAD, but symptoms related to hyperarousal, autonomic hyperactivity, motor tension, sleep disturbance and pain are all common. (See <a href=\"#H448541448\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GAD tends to run either a chronic course fluctuating in severity over time, or an episodic course with some intervening periods of relative well-being. Comorbid GAD and major depression is more impairing and has a worse prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H448541455\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of a patient with possible GAD should include a careful history, an evaluation for symptoms of GAD as well as alternative or comorbid psychiatric disorders, and a physical exam and laboratory studies to rule out organic causes of anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H601612474\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguishing GAD from major depression and dysthymia is probably the most difficult part of the disorder&rsquo;s differential diagnosis, as the conditions share features such as an insidious onset, protracted course, prominent dysphoria and anxiety symptoms. Individuals with depression tend to brood self-critically on previous events and circumstances, whereas patients with GAD tend to worry about possible future events.
