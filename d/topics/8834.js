Maternal diabetes may be pregestational (ie, type 1 or type 2 diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy with a prevalence rate of about 1.8 percent) or gestational (ie, diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy with a prevalence rate of about 7.5 percent). The outcome is generally related to the onset and duration of glucose intolerance during pregnancy and severity of the mother's diabetes.

This primarily occurs in pregnancies with pregestational diabetes. The risk for congenital malformations is only slightly increased with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared with the general population (odds ratio [OR] 1.1-1.3). The risk of malformations increases as maternal fasting blood glucose levels and body mass index (BMI) increases when GDM is diagnosed early in pregnancy. These findings suggest that some of these mothers are probably undiagnosed women with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-of-a-diabetic-mother/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Fetal hypoxemia contributes to increased mortality, metabolic acidosis, alterations in fetal iron distribution, and increased erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-of-a-diabetic-mother/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Increased synthesis of erythropoietin leads to polycythemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-of-a-diabetic-mother/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]; promotes catecholamine production, which can result in hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy; and may contribute to the 20 to 30 percent rate of stillbirth seen in poorly controlled diabetic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-of-a-diabetic-mother/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Data from studies performed in Pima Indians, who have the highest rates of gestational diabetes, demonstrate that 45 percent of offspring of mothers with gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes between 20 and 24 years of age compared with offspring of prediabetic or nondiabetic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-of-a-diabetic-mother/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. This increased risk persists despite accounting for paternal history of diabetes, age of onset of diabetes in parents, and the child's body mass index (BMI), suggesting that the intrauterine environment contributed to the development of diabetes, in addition to genetic factors. In a follow-up study, more than two-thirds of offspring of mothers with gestational diabetes developed type 2 diabetes by 34 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infant-of-a-diabetic-mother/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity and glucose metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine exposure to hyperglycemia resulting in fetal hyperinsulinemia may affect the development of adipose tissue and pancreatic beta cells leading to increased BMI and impaired glucose metabolism, which may result in an increased risk for obesity.

In addition, maternal hyperglycemia leads to increased fetal growth resulting in macrosomia and fetal hyperinsulinemia, which increase the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Fetal effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) are at increased risk for mortality and morbidity compared with infants born to nondiabetic mothers. The risk of neonatal complications generally increases with poor maternal glycemic control. Potential adverse effects include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Congenital anomalies, especially cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) defects. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Congenital anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preterm birth.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal asphyxia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Macrosomia, defined as a birth weight (BW) greater than the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile or greater than 4000 g. In IDMs, macrosomia is associated with disproportionate growth that results in high chest-to-head and shoulder-to-head ratios that predispose to birth injury, especially shoulder dystocia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54212\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54212 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Macrosomia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory distress is a common complication in IDMs, primarily due to the increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory distress'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypoglycemia that generally occurs within the first few hours after birth. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypocalcemia is commonly observed in IDMs, but generally is asymptomatic.

(See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Cardiomyopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of an IDM needs to anticipate and treat any complication associated with maternal hyperglycemia and also provides routine neonatal care. It includes a physical examination that focuses on the respiratory and cardiac status of the infant and identifies any major congenital anomaly. We recommend that one hour after delivery, laboratory evaluation include measurement of the infant's blood glucose and hematocrit (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H714043\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term outcome data suggest that prenatal exposure to hyperglycemia increases the risk of postnatal metabolic complications (eg, diabetes, increased body mass index [BMI], and impaired glucose metabolism) and may also negatively impact neurodevelopmental outcome.
