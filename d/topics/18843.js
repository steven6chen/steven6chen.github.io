It does not squeeze or fill as well as before. As a result, the heart struggles to keep blood moving, but it lags behind. The organs in your body might not get as much blood as they used to, especially when you exercise. Also, fluid builds up in the body. </p><p>Fluid can build up in the feet and ankles. That's why people with heart failure sometimes get swollen ankles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61706 \">figure 1</a>). Fluid can also build up in the lungs. That's why people with heart failure sometimes have trouble breathing. Having fluid in the lungs can be life-threatening. Fluid in the lungs is the number 1 reason people with heart failure end up in the hospital. But it is often avoidable. </p><p>To keep heart failure from getting worse, and to keep yourself breathing as well as possible, one of the most important things you can do is to keep your body from holding onto extra fluid. That's why it is so important to take your medicines for heart failure and look for warning signs. These 2 things are explained more below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7574147\"><span class=\"h1\">Why are medicines for heart failure so important?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines to treat heart failure can help you feel better and live longer. They can help keep fluid out of your lungs and help you breathe better. Missing just one dose of medicine can make a big difference in how you feel.</p><p>One type of heart failure medicine is a &quot;diuretic&quot; (sometimes called a water pill). A diuretic helps the body get rid of extra salt and fluid. That way fluid is less likely to build up in the ankles, belly, or &ndash; most importantly &ndash; the lungs.</p><p>Some people skip their diuretic because they do not like having to go to the bathroom all the time. But if you are going to the bathroom a lot to urinate, that means the medicine is working. It means your lungs are less likely to fill with fluid.</p><p>Ask your doctor or nurse which of your medicines is a diuretic. The most commonly used diuretic for heart failure is called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">furosemide</a>&quot; (brand name: Lasix).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7574196\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there warning signs that my lungs are filling with fluid?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, often there are! When heart failure is getting worse, the body gives off the following clues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight gain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or other parts of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased tiredness or trouble breathing</p><p/><p>If you spot one or more of these signs, you should take action. Your body is telling you that things are starting to go wrong.</p><p>You and your doctor or nurse can write up an &quot;action plan.&quot; The action plan will tell you what to do if you spot signs that your heart failure is getting worse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72459 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75501 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7574246\"><span class=\"h1\">Why must I weigh myself every day?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water is heavy, so your weight will go up if your body is holding onto extra fluid. If you weigh yourself every day, you will know right away when fluid starts to build up. Weight gain can be an early sign that your heart failure is getting worse. If you spot a weight change, you can take steps to keep the problem from getting worse.</p><p>Here's what you should do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weigh yourself every morning after you urinate and before you eat or drink.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the same scale and wear roughly the same amount of clothing (or wear nothing) every time you weigh yourself.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep a chart near the scale and <strong>write down</strong> your weight every day.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each time you write down your weight, check if the number has gone up from the day before and the week before. If so, follow your action plan.</p><p/><p>For most people, a weight gain of 2 to 3 pounds in 1 day is cause for concern. Gaining 5 pounds in 1 week is also a bad sign. Weight gains like these are often signs that your body is holding onto extra fluid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7574261\"><span class=\"h1\">Why must I check for swelling every day?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you become swollen, that's another sign that your body is holding onto extra fluid. If any part of your body looks more swollen than usual, don't ignore it. Even if you do not feel any differently than usual, this might be a sign that your heart failure is worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7574276\"><span class=\"h1\">Follow an action plan!</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Now that you know how to spot the clues that your heart failure is getting worse, you need to know what to do if you notice those changes. Ask your doctor or nurse to fill out an action plan with you. An action plan is a set of instructions on what to do if you have changes in symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72459 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75501 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p>Take your action plan seriously. Keep it on the refrigerator or someplace where you can easily find it. If you follow your action plan closely, you might be able to avoid a trip to the hospital or know when it is important to call an ambulance to go to the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7574291\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
