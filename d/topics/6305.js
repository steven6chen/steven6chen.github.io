The enteroviruses are divided into four species designated A through D based on homology within the RNA region encoding the VP1 capsid protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Isolates of the same &quot;serotype&quot; characteristically diverge in the VP1 region by less than 25 percent and 12 percent, respectively, within corresponding nucleotide and amino acid sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Originally, unique enterovirus serotypes were distinguished from one another by neutralization with specific antisera and assigned to one of five traditional sub-genera based on differences in host range and pathogenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Multiple new enteroviruses have been identified and characterized by molecular methods, bringing the number of known serotypes to more than 100. </p><p>The parechoviruses share many biological, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics with the enteroviruses, but differ sufficiently in genomic sequence to be classified as a separate genus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prototypic parechovirus serotypes 1 and 2 were originally designated echovirus 22 and 23, respectively. Fourteen parechovirus serotypes are now recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteroviruses and parechoviruses are small (approximately 27 nm), nonenveloped virions consisting of an icosahedral capsid composed of 60 subunits, each formed from four proteins (VP1 to VP4), that enclose a linear, single-strand RNA genome of about 7.5 kB. The translation product is a single polyprotein that is cleaved by viral coded proteases into the structural proteins (VP1 to VP4), an RNA polymerase, proteases, and other nonstructural proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Enteroviruses are relatively acid resistant, maintaining infectivity over a wide pH range. They are resistant to ether and alcohol but inactivated at temperatures above 50&ordm;C, although molar <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium chloride</a> reduces lability at higher temperatures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracellular replication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection is initiated by attachment to specific cell membrane receptors that determine host cell susceptibility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50791\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50791 \">table 1</a>). More than one receptor has been identified for some serotypes (eg, group B coxsackieviruses 1, 3, and 5 and enterovirus 71. Penetration and uncoating of the virion with release of RNA into the cell cytoplasm occurs within minutes, and synthesis of negative strand RNA begins within 30 minutes. The progeny positive strand RNA serves as message for translation, and is also encapsidated into newly formed virions. By 6 to 12 hours, complete virions are visible by electron microscopy. Each infected cell yields approximately 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> virions, although only 0.1 to 10 percent are infectious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473596835\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonal and demographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enterovirus and parechovirus infection occurs throughout the year, with temperate climates experiencing high rates of infection in summer and fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While enterovirus infections occur in all age groups, infants less than one year of age become infected at rates that exceed those of older children and adults by several-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. For unknown reasons, males have a risk of disease that exceeds the risk in females by as much as 50 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of enteroviruses and parechoviruses occurs predominantly via direct or indirect oral contact with fecally shed virus. Such transmission is abetted by poor sanitary conditions and may occur via numerous routes, including contaminated water, food, and fomites. Both epidemiological and experimental observations suggest that the respiratory route is the principal mode of transmission for some serotypes, including coxsackievirus A21 and enterovirus D68 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Enterovirus D70 is shed in tears and is readily spread via fingers and fomites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal studies demonstrate that secondary infections occur at high rates in susceptible household contacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Infants, particularly those in diapers, appear to be efficient transmitters. The relative role of virus shedding by symptomatic and asymptomatic persons is not known, but it is likely that both are important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotypes and disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contribution of each of the enterovirus and parechovirus serotypes to human infection and disease varies substantially. A high proportion (30 to 80 percent) of adults possess antibody to the more common enterovirus serotypes (eg, group B coxsackieviruses 1 to 5 and some echoviruses).</p><p>A small number of serotypes cause endemic disease in patterns that vary regionally on an annual basis. Other serotypes are responsible for widespread outbreaks in which the epidemic strain accounts for more than 30 percent of all isolated enteroviruses, followed by several years of relative quiescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, between 1970 and 2005, 10 serotypes (all species B enteroviruses) represented 71 percent of all enterovirus isolates submitted from state and local public health laboratories to the National Enterovirus Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In contrast, some enterovirus serotypes (eg, echovirus 1, coxsackievirus B6, and enterovirus B69) are rarely recognized clinically and appear to have little epidemic potential. The reasons that particular serotypes appear and disappear are not known. It has been suggested that accumulation of a &quot;critical mass&quot; of susceptible young children may be necessary to sustain epidemic transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Occasional epidemics are nearly global, such as those caused by echovirus 9 in the late 1950s, the worldwide pandemic of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis due to enterovirus D70 that began in 1969, and the 1979 to 1980 echovirus 11 epidemic.</p><p>Enterovirus A71 has evolved as a unique cause of epidemic paralysis, in which localized outbreaks have involved small numbers of patients over several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>], and regional epidemics in the Far East have involved hundreds to thousands of persons within a single season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-37</a>].

The most common parechovirus serotypes are 1 and 3, with type 3 predominating as a cause of central nervous system infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral replication and dissemination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of in vivo enterovirus replication and dissemination is largely based upon the studies of poliovirus infection in primates of Bodian, Sabin, and others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73829\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73829 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The initial sites of virus replication include both the pharynx and terminal ileum. Replication gives rise to a transient, &quot;minor&quot; viremia, which spreads virus hematogenously to lymphoid tissue throughout the body. Subsequent replication at these sites ultimately produces a &quot;major&quot; viremia, which coincides with the onset of symptoms, and results in spread of virus to target organs such as the central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunity to enterovirus and parechovirus infection is serotype specific. Although reinfection with the same enterovirus serotype occurs, it is invariably asymptomatic. The humoral immune response plays a dominant role both in response to infection and for prevention of disease with reinfection. Secretory IgA, which appears in mucosal secretions and colostrum approximately two weeks after infection, provides relative protection against infection.</p><p>However, humoral antibody alone is not sufficient to limit enteroviral replication in vivo. Macrophage function plays a critical role in viral clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and recent findings in transgenic mice expressing the human poliovirus receptor have shown that the host interferon response inhibits poliovirus replication in extraneural tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This activity is likely mediated via interaction with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. </p><p>T lymphocytes do not contribute to viral clearance. To the contrary, in the murine model of coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis, the cytotoxic T cell response contributes to myocardial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>Certain hosts are more susceptible to serious, life-threatening disease. Neonates may develop serious and sometimes fatal systemic enterovirus infections, which are transmitted from infected mothers in the perinatal period. In addition, enteroviruses can cause persistent infections in patients with hereditary or acquired defects in B lymphocyte function, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia or adults with common variable immunodeficiency.
