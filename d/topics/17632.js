Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct clinicopathologic entity demonstrating lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) in the bone marrow with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy (macroglobulinemia) in the blood. Patients may present with symptoms related to the infiltration of the lymph nodes and spleen or the effects of monoclonal IgM in the blood.</p><p>There is no standard therapy for the treatment of symptomatic WM. Whenever possible, patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. This topic review presents suggestions for the treatment of patients who are not eligible for clinical trials or who choose not to participate in clinical trials.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of WM will be reviewed here.

These patients are considered to have smoldering (asymptomatic, indolent) WM and should not be treated until symptoms develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The decision to postpone treatment in this population is largely based upon their good prognosis without therapy and concerns over the short- and long-term complications of treatment.</p><p>While the severity of anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia that merits treatment is unknown, we generally consider a hemoglobin &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;100,000/microL</span> to be adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We follow asymptomatic patients every four to six months with complete blood counts and monoclonal protein levels for the first five years and then annually, if stable. Those who develop symptomatic disease, anemia, or thrombocytopenia are offered therapy. If disease progression is unclear, repeat studies obtained three to six months later can help to clarify the disease tempo and whether treatment is indicated.</p><p>Studies that have used varying hemoglobin values (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> to implement treatment have all noted that smoldering WM may remain stable without treatment for long periods of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/2,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-8</a>].

As an example, a study of 48 patients with smoldering WM followed for a median of 15 years reported a cumulative rate of evolution to symptomatic WM, amyloidosis, or lymphoma of 6 percent at one year, 39 percent at three years, 59 percent at five years, and 68 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. On multivariate analysis, higher rates of disease evolution were seen in patients with higher serum levels of IgM, lower levels of hemoglobin, and a higher percentage of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow.</p><p>WM is incurable with current therapy and there is no evidence that the treatment of asymptomatic patients provides a survival benefit when compared with treatment at the time symptoms develop. Treatment is also associated with both short- and long-term complications that can decrease quality of life and potentially affect survival. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> administration can result in a clinically important temporary increase in serum IgM levels (IgM flare), prolonged immunosuppression, and the reactivation of a latent hepatitis B virus infection. As another example, a small percentage of patients treated with nucleoside analogs or alkylating agents develop a more aggressive lymphoma or leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is indicated for patients with symptomatic WM. Symptoms can be divided into four major clinical groups: symptoms related to the underlying lymphoproliferative process (eg, constitutional symptoms, cytopenias, or tissue infiltration), hyperviscosity related to the overproduction of IgM, symptoms due to associated conditions (eg, amyloid, cryoglobulinemia, hemolytic anemia, cold agglutinin), and paraneoplastic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The presence of any of the following symptoms may be used as an indication for the initiation of therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97667 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This topic will discuss treatment directed against the proliferating malignant cells, which is indicated in patients with any of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Systemic symptoms &ndash; Fever, drenching night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe neuropathy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Physical findings &ndash; Symptomatic or bulky (&ge;5 cm) lymphadenopathy, symptomatic hepatomegaly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatic splenomegaly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laboratory abnormalities &ndash; Hemoglobin &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coexisting disease &ndash; AL amyloidosis with organ dysfunction, symptomatic cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin anemia, immune hemolytic anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia, or nephropathy due to WM</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of hyperviscosity is suggested by symptoms and signs such as oronasal bleeding, blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, paresthesias, retinal vein engorgement and flame-shaped hemorrhages, papilledema, and, finally, stupor and coma.

Treatment of the underlying WM can ameliorate the peripheral neuropathy, but complete resolution is uncommon. Plasmapheresis alone, corticosteroids, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) have little or no value in this setting.

Instead, the goals of treatment are to control symptoms and prevent end-organ damage, while maximizing quality of life. There is no standard therapy for the treatment of WM. While various drugs and combinations have demonstrated clinical benefit in prospective trials, these have not been compared directly in randomized trials. In addition, individual trials have used different response criteria thereby making it difficult to compare these agents or regimens based on response rates alone. </p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with the consensus treatment recommendations proposed by the International Workshops on WM (IWWM-8), Mayo Stratification of Macroglobulinemia and Risk-Adapted Therapy (mSMART), and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97649\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97649 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. There are limited data comparing different treatment approaches and other experts advocate for the earlier incorporation of novel agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28253348\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of patients with symptomatic WM is dependent upon age, the severity of symptoms, eligibility for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), presence of comorbidities, and patient preferences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97649\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97649 \">algorithm 1</a>). When choosing a therapy, the following principles apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy should be reserved for patients with symptomatic disease since asymptomatic patients may do well without therapy and treatment has potential short- and long-term complications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with symptoms of hyperviscosity require emergency plasmapheresis in addition to therapy directed at the malignant clone. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Emergency management of hyperviscosity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are candidates for autologous HCT should avoid treatment with agents that might interfere with stem cell collection (eg, most alkylators except for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, or nucleoside analogs). We collect and cryopreserve stem cells from most younger patients (age &le;70) who are candidates for transplant. Other experts do not collect stem cells at this time. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intensity of the regimen is dictated by the severity of symptoms; more intense regimens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>; or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, and rituximab) that may have a quicker response time but increased side effects are offered to patients with highly symptomatic disease while patients with minimal symptoms are offered regimens (eg, single agent rituximab) that are better tolerated, but slower. (See <a href=\"#H865114398\" class=\"local\">'Selection of regimen'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment regimens vary by delivery route and length of therapy. Rituximab-based therapies are intravenous regimens given over a defined period of time. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bortezomib</a> can be given intravenously or subcutaneously over a defined period of time. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibrutinib</a> is an oral medication administered daily until progression. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is frequently associated with a transient increase in serum IgM level (IgM flare) after administration, which can result in symptoms of hyperviscosity.

Alternatively, plasmapheresis may be used before rituximab administration to prevent flare in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H2970538977\" class=\"local\">'Minimizing risk of IgM flare'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experts differ in their use of maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. The goal of therapy is the alleviation of the signs or symptoms that prompted treatment initiation. Once there is improvement in these parameters, further therapy has not been shown to improve survival. As such, we do not offer routine maintenance therapy. (See <a href=\"#H779381987\" class=\"local\">'Role of maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Experts differ in their preferred initial therapy. As described in the sections below, we prefer initial treatment that incorporates <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (either alone or with other agents) based on its low toxicity profile, acceptable response rates, and short defined course of therapy. Others favor the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a> based on its low toxicity profile and studies demonstrating efficacy in the relapsed setting.

Red blood cell transfusions should be avoided, if possible, prior to plasmapheresis since they might further increase serum viscosity. Although the diagnosis is established by measuring serum viscosity, the clinician should make the decision to initiate plasmapheresis on the basis of the patient's symptoms and physical findings (eg, oronasal bleeding, blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, paresthesias, retinal vein engorgement and flame-shaped hemorrhages, papilledema, stupor and coma), rather than on the magnitude of the viscosity measurement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;, section on 'Hyperviscosity syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The only effective treatment for the hyperviscosity syndrome is the removal of IgM from the circulation via plasmapheresis. The large size of the IgM molecule restricts it mainly to the intravascular space such that it can be rapidly removed with plasmapheresis resulting in prompt alleviation of symptoms. Once plasmapheresis is complete, patients will need to initiate therapy to control the malignant clone. Details of the plasmapheresis procedure are discussed separately.

In most cases, serum IgM levels will rise and symptoms of hyperviscosity will recur within a few weeks of stopping plasmapheresis unless therapy directed at the malignant cells is initiated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reasonable initial prescription is a total plasma volume exchange (ie, 3 to 4 liters in an adult) replaced with albumin (rather than plasma), repeated daily until symptoms subside or until serum viscosity is normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperviscosity syndromes are usually associated with an increased plasma volume. Thus, the volume of plasma needed for a &quot;one volume exchange&quot; may be greater than that calculated by commonly used formulae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion with packed red blood cells during this period may further increase whole blood viscosity and precipitate or aggravate heart failure.</p><p/><p>Our approach is consistent with the 2016 guidelines published by the American Society for Apheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and the 2016 consensus treatment recommendations proposed by the International Workshops on WM (IWWM-8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], which conclude that plasmapheresis is first-line therapy for hyperviscosity syndrome and may be used before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> administration to prevent flare in patients with high IgM levels (typically &gt;4000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. </p><p>This recommendation is supported by strong evidence from small observational studies demonstrating efficacy of plasmapheresis in this setting and large observational studies demonstrating the safety of plasmapheresis in general. There have been no randomized trials of plasmapheresis in the management of hyperviscosity syndrome. The published literature consists of prospective trials with historical controls, case series, and case reports accumulating data on approximately 300 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These studies have demonstrated that a single plasmapheresis treatment reduces IgM levels by 30 to 50 percent and is associated with a decrease in serum viscosity, an increase in capillary blood flow, and improvement in the clinical manifestations of hyperviscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Complications due to plasmapheresis are seen in less than 2 percent of patients replaced with albumin and most commonly consist of citrate-induced paresthesias, muscle cramps, and urticaria. The complications of plasmapheresis are discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The term &quot;major response&quot; is used to identify patients who qualify for a partial, very good partial, or complete response. Serum monoclonal IgM levels provide an easily accessible measure of disease status, but can sometimes fluctuate independent of disease activity. As an example, IgM levels can increase transiently after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>. As such, bone marrow biopsy should be considered in patients with a clinical picture that does not appear concordant with the serum monoclonal IgM level.</p><p>Importantly, IgM values are dependent upon the method of measurement used (eg, nephelometry, densitometry). As such, sequential response assessments for individual patients should be performed in the same laboratory using the same methodology.</p><p>Patients who have stable or progressive disease are treated as refractory disease. Responses to some chemotherapy regimens may not be seen until after several cycles of therapy. As such, we do not usually switch therapies for stable disease unless there is no response after three or more cycles. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of relapsed or refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779381987\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance therapy refers to the prolonged administration of agents with low toxicity profiles in an attempt to prevent progression of disease. Maintenance therapy has been incorporated into the management of other indolent forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma principally based on its ability to prolong time to progression in these subtypes. There are limited data regarding the use of maintenance therapy in WM and no randomized trials. </p><p>Experts differ in their use of maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. We do not offer maintenance therapy to patients with WM. This differs from the recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and International Workshops on WM (IWWM) which offer maintenance rituximab as an option for patients who have responded to chemoimmunotherapy. We believe that the goal of therapy is the alleviation of the signs or symptoms that prompted treatment initiation. Once there is improvement in these parameters, maintenance rituximab has not been shown to improve survival.</p><p>A single-center retrospective analysis of 248 patients with WM who demonstrated an initial response to rituximab-containing therapy compared outcomes among those who received (86 patients) maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Those who received maintenance rituximab demonstrated longer median progression-free and overall survival times and increased rates of infection. However, there are several limitations to this study that impair general interpretation. Most importantly, maintenance therapy was not randomized. Instead, the use of maintenance therapy was incorporated into the routine care at this center after May 2001. As such, patients who received maintenance rituximab were more likely to have access to novel treatments at the time of progression, potentially affecting overall survival. In addition, patients who received maintenance rituximab were more likely to have attained a complete response and to have demonstrated greater improvements in serum IgM and hematocrit, factors likely to have an impact on progression-free survival.</p><p>Until further data in support of maintenance therapy are reported, we offer observation with treatment at the time of progression rather than the use of maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy has associated side effects, inconvenience, and cost and has not demonstrated a clinical benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779381995\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for progressive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the completion of therapy, restaging, and documentation of a response, patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for disease progression. The frequency and extent of these visits depends on the comfort of both the patient and physician. Our approach to patient surveillance is to schedule patient visits every three months for the first year then every six months. At these visits we perform a history and physical examination, complete blood count, and measurement of monoclonal (M) protein in serum or urine. There is no role for routine imaging studies in the longitudinal follow-up of asymptomatic patients after response assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H858126\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic transformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapsed or refractory disease must be distinguished from histologic transformation, which requires a different treatment approach. Histologic transformation of WM into a rapidly progressive, high-grade malignant lymphoma may occur after a typical low-grade course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The transformation is usually associated with a decrease in performance status, rapid development of lymphadenopathy, increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, presence of abnormal metaphase cytogenetics of involved bone marrow or lymph nodes, and often a decrease in the serum IgM level. Histologic transformation can be suggested by changes on imaging studies, but can only be confirmed by biopsy. As such, a biopsy should always be obtained to document histologic transformation before proceeding with therapy. Survival from the time of transformation is usually very short, and response to treatment has been short-lived. Approach is similar to that of histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma, which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RELAPSED OR REFRACTORY DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505173520\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with WM will ultimately relapse after an initial response to therapy. Treatment options for patients with relapsed disease include reinstitution of the initial therapy, use of an alternative first-line agent, or high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (See <a href=\"#H865114398\" class=\"local\">'Selection of regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1028221829\" class=\"local\">'Other combination regimens'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, it is not necessary to restart therapy based on M protein elevations alone in patients who have previously achieved a major response to therapy; rather, the criteria for re-initiation of therapy are similar to those used in newly diagnosed patients and include recurrence of symptoms and cytopenias. Rarely, palliative splenectomy may be offered to patients with symptomatic, painful splenomegaly or hypersplenism. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> above.) </p><p>There is no standard treatment and there have been no randomized trials to guide therapy. The following approach is based upon a review of the existing data, clinical experience, and observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptomatic patients relapsing more than three years following initial treatment, we repeat the original treatment.

These agents are both associated with a risk of stem cell damage, and hence are not used as initial therapy in patients who are candidates for stem cell transplantation. Purine nucleoside analogs have also been associated with a higher degree of transformation. The use of these agents is primarily reserved for patients with multiply relapsed or refractory WM and a good performance status.</p><p>A single-institution retrospective analysis of 439 patients with WM who received nucleoside analog-containing regimens (193 patients), regimens that did not contain nucleoside analogs (136 patients), or observation alone (110 patients) reported a higher combined rate of transformation to an aggressive lymphoma (Richter syndrome), myelodysplasia, or acute leukemia in patients who received nucleoside analog-based therapy (6.2 versus 0.4 percent, respectively) after a median follow-up of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Nucleoside analogs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a>) are active in WM, but are associated with stem cell toxicity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a risk of transformation to a higher grade lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/abstract/9,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,60</a>]. Therefore, these regimens should be avoided as initial therapy in patients who are candidates for autologous HCT until stem cells have been collected.
