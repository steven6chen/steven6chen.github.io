Despite the differences between the normal form and function of joints and, for example, the bone marrow, it is becoming clearer that the same cytokines that drive synovial pathology are also responsible for generating pathology in extraarticular tissues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Involvement of the musculoskeletal system other than joints (eg, bone and muscle) and of organs not considered part of the musculoskeletal system (eg, skin, eye, lung, heart, kidney, blood vessels, salivary glands, central and peripheral nervous systems, and bone marrow) occurs in about 40 percent of patients with RA over a lifetime of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These manifestations are reviewed here. Articular manifestations are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3788849\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for systemic, extraarticular disease include age, presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) or antinuclear antibodies, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 &lsquo;shared epitope&rsquo; alleles, early disability, and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. Patients with severe extraarticular RA often have high levels of RF at presentation of systemic manifestations and are more likely to have circulating antibodies against citrullinated proteins than are patients with RA but without extraarticular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Extraarticular involvement in RA is a marker of disease severity and is associated with increased overall morbidity and premature mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Successful management of systemic manifestations of RA is predicated upon control of the underlying joint disease and often includes glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2047790173\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSTITUTIONAL/SYSTEMIC SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms and findings of systemic and nonarticular manifestations may include generalized aching, stiffness, and constitutional symptoms such as fevers, weight loss, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. These symptoms sometimes antedate the onset of articular disease by several months. Weight may decline over time, especially among older patients and among those with elevated inflammatory markers, erosive disease, and higher initial body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Fatigue is often multifactorial. A systematic review has reported that pain; sleep disturbances; cognitive, emotional, and physical functioning; and social factors contribute to fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. By contrast, no consistent relationships between inflammatory variables and fatigue have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Affective disorders are common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A 2013 meta-analysis reported a 17 percent pooled prevalence of major depressive disorder and a 39 percent prevalence of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is unclear if depression is mediated by negative cognitive perceptions, behavioral tendencies, or immune-mediated processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A proposed disease model suggests that RA disease activity and physical and mental health are connected via central neuroendocrine pathways as well as altered dopaminergic pathways, resulting in abnormal pain processing, negative affect, and maladaptive coping strategies, contributing ultimately to physical and psychosocial distress in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The decrease in bone density secondary to the disease itself is separate from glucocorticoid-induced osteopenia; in some patients, however, the disease and glucocorticoid treatment are additive, producing substantial morbidity. Patients with RA have a 30 percent increased risk of major osteoporotic fracture and 40 percent increased risk of hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These individuals are those who are particularly prone to loss of height, symptomatic vertebral compression fractures, and stress fractures of metatarsals or long bones in the leg. Patients who develop fractures are often immobilized for significant periods; this deficiency of normal weightbearing amplifies bone loss by diminishing new bone formation while bone resorption continues at an accelerated pace.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Periodontal bone loss may be associated with joint destruction at the wrist, and both have been associated with the possession of the &ldquo;shared epitope&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The presence of a lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands and the sicca syndrome were also associated with periodontal bone resorption in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Periarticular</strong> &ndash; Demineralization in a periarticular distribution is characteristic of RA and results from inhibition of bone formation by the effects of cytokines on local immune cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have revealed periarticular bone edema lesions identified as bright areas on T2-weighted sequences. Histopathological studies have shown these lesions to represent &ldquo;osteitis&rdquo; composed of replacement of bone marrow fat with lymphoid aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Decline in local hand bone density in early RA is predictive of a higher risk of radiographic erosions, although this may not have any impact on physical function or quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

The presence of focal erosions also correlates with systemic bone loss and osteoporosis in the course of early disease; beyond the first few years of RA, this relationship is blurred by other confounding factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

This was illustrated in one study of 287 Norwegian patients among whom the prevalence of osteoporosis, as indicated by a bone mineral density of more than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for healthy young people at one or both sites, was 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>There are conflicting data on the frequency of glucocorticoid-associated osteopenia in rheumatoid patients taking low-dose (&lt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. This issue and the mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis#H670770520\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>All else being equal, it is likely that net bone loss in a patient with RA who is taking low-dose daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> would exceed that in a patient not treated with glucocorticoids. However, it is possible that, in those patients who gain greater mobility and exercise tolerance, with the use of 5 to 7.5 mg of prednisone each day, the increase in bone loss from the therapy would be offset by an increase in new bone formation associated with an increase in muscle contraction and weightbearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In a multivariable analysis of several risk factors for vertebral compression fracture in 925 women with RA, a one-point increase in disability (as measured by the health assessment questionnaire) was associated with more fracture risk than a 1-gram cumulative dose of prednisone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In addition, there may be factors other than the disease process itself and glucocorticoid therapy that are associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis.

In one study of 94 males with RA compared with population controls, there was a twofold increase in osteopenia among patients (bone mineral density [BMD] decreased by more than one standard deviation [SD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Multiple regression analysis found advancing age and lower body weight to be associated with lower BMD at the femoral neck and total hip. However, disease-related factors, including concurrent glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid factor (RF) status, and self-reported disability, were not associated with osteopenia in the hip or spine.</p><p>There is a high incidence of stress fracture of long bones in patients with RA, particularly in those treated with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Synovitis and glucocorticoid use are both risk factors for thinning of cortical bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The fibula is the most common fracture site and, in older patients, often manifests as acute and debilitating pain in the lateral leg with no history of trauma. Other fractures can be facilitated by geodes, the subchondral cysts that develop when high intraarticular pressures force synovial fluid through breaks in the subchondral plate in patients who have particularly aggressive, proliferative synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Vertebral compression deformities are also more common among those with RA than among age- and gender-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The higher prevalence is not fully explained by their lower BMD or by the use of glucocorticoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It should be assumed that every patient with RA is at risk for osteoporosis. Those patients with added risk factors outlined above should be considered for baseline determinations of BMD before the disease becomes well-entrenched and before glucocorticoid therapy is started. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is a widely available, precise, and reliable method for measuring bone density; quantitative computerized tomography (CT) is another option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The generalized and periarticular osteopenia that affects all patients with RA should lead to a low threshold for therapy to prevent bone loss. Interventions that are used to prevent or minimize RA and glucocorticoid-induced bone loss are presented elsewhere. Rheumatologists and primary care clinicians should have a low threshold for initiating bisphosphonate therapy in patients, particularly postmenopausal women, with RA.

This effect is most obvious in the knee, in which synovitis quickly leads to quadriceps weakness. This weakness results in greater mechanical stress on the affected joints. As an example, when the quadriceps muscles weaken, more force is applied directly through the patella than when quadriceps strength is normal. Exercise can help prevent muscle weakness or can help restore muscle strength when due to synovitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-therapies-and-preventive-measures-for-patients-with-rheumatoid-arthritis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic therapies and preventive measures for patients with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Myositis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In autopsy series, focal accumulation of lymphocytes and plasma cells contiguous with foci of muscle necrosis are found in almost all patients with RA. These lesions have been called nodular myositis. They are particularly common in a small but interesting subset of patients who have mild synovitis and a disproportionately elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Some foci of muscle lymphocytes have been shown to synthesize immunoglobulin M (IgM) rheumatoid factor (RF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Rarely, a patient with RA develops a true polymyositis, with elevated levels of serum creatine kinase and with typical findings on electromyography and muscle biopsy. These patients should be managed as are those with polymyositis, by using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in moderately high doses (60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and by having a plan of moving quickly to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (25 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">intramuscular/week)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (up to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day).

Risk factors include high titers of RF and active extraarticular disease elsewhere, such as nodulosis or scleritis. Involvement of skeletal muscle vessels can cause acute pain in muscle bundles associated with an acute flare of disease, while a vasculitic neuropathy can cause muscle weakness and a mononeuritis multiplex. With the use of aggressive and effective disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapies for RA, this manifestation has become less common, occurring in less than 1 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug-induced myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superimposed on active RA, with or without muscle involvement, a drug-induced myopathy can gradually weaken a patient and can confuse the clinician who may assume that there is an inflammatory cause for the weakness.

Some patients become weak after a low dose of glucocorticoids for a few weeks, while others never develop myopathy despite receiving large doses for months or years. Despite this variability, there is a general dose relationship for systemic glucocorticoid therapy.

Statins and other lipid-lowering drugs may cause muscle injury, typically with muscle pain. Thus, treatment with a statin or, rarely, with other lipid-lowering drugs should be considered as a cause of myalgia or weakness in a patient with RA who is being treated for dyslipidemia.

Both small- and medium-sized vessels can be involved. Rheumatoid vasculitis is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following is a brief summary of some of the varied manifestations of rheumatoid vasculitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal arteritis that can range from nailfold infarcts (common) to gangrene of finger tips (rare).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous ulceration, which can resemble pyoderma gangrenosum in severe cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurovascular disease, which can lead to a mild distal sensory neuropathy or to a severe sensorimotor neuropathy (eg, mononeuritis multiplex). Neuropathic pain may be a major problem, but this often responds to immunosuppressive treatment in patients with vasculitis-related neuropathy. Other symptoms, such as numbness or local weakness, are more likely to persist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visceral arteritis, which is identical to necrotizing polyarteritis and which can involve peripheral nerves, as well as the bowel, lungs, heart, spleen, and other organs. Intestinal involvement can begin as minor abdominal pain, with an initially normal physical examination, that can progress to severe pain with abdominal tenderness and a lack of bowel sounds on physical examination, bowel infarction, and gastrointestinal bleeding. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura, which is rarely found in untreated RA and which, when present, is usually linked to antirheumatic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital gangrene, the presence of intestinal involvement, cardiac involvement, and mononeuritis multiplex, which are associated with a very poor prognosis.

This was illustrated in a study that compared 234 nonsmoking North American patients with RA with 102 healthy nonsmoking controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Peripheral arterial abnormalities (an abnormal ankle or brachial index <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of occlusion of a peripheral artery) were present in a significantly greater proportion of those with RA (19 versus 5 percent). These differences were not explained by traditional markers of cardiovascular risk such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. However, markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and glucocorticoid use accounted for some of the excess risk seen in those with RA.</p><p>The presence of other systemic and nonarticular manifestations of RA appears to be an independent risk factor for the development of peripheral vascular disease. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 609 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. After adjustment for other risk factors, the incidence of peripheral vascular events was significantly greater in those with severe extraarticular features of RA than in those without these features (hazard ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.20-4.34).</p><p>In particular, patients with RA appear to have an up to twofold higher occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. In one population-based study in the US, the risk appeared somewhat higher in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents, although it was unknown whether this was a drug effect or whether anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) exposure was a surrogate for more severe disease which may itself be related to this increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In another population-based study, conducted in Sweden, the increase in risk among patients with RA compared with the general population could be detected within the year following diagnosis and did not increase further during the first decade of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The risk was further increased among patients who required hospitalization, although the increase in such patients with RA was comparable with that in the general population. Another study, involving a US cohort of 22.143 patients with RA and 88,572 matched controls without RA, found an elevated risk of venous thromboembolic events (a composite of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) in patients with RA, even after adjustment for multiple risk factors for VTE (eg, cardiovascular disease, hospitalization, surgery, and medications) (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Risk factors for systemic, extraarticular disease include the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), and smoking. Extraarticular involvement in RA is associated with increased severity of disease, with overall morbidity, and with premature mortality. Successful management depends upon control of the underlying joint disease and upon additional strategies.

It may be generalized, resulting from immobility, the inflammatory process, and treatment effects with glucocorticoids; periarticular, due to local inhibition of bone formation by immune cells; or focal, due to degradation of juxtaarticular bone by activated osteoclasts. In the absence of antiresorptive therapy, all patients with RA can be expected to lose bone mineral. The generalized and periarticular osteopenia that affects all patients with RA should lead to a low threshold for therapy to prevent bone loss.
