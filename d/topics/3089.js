Its most important biological action is to promote enterocyte differentiation and the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, thereby promoting bone mineralization. At high vitamin D concentrations, under conditions of calcium and phosphate deficiency, it also stimulates bone resorption, thereby helping to maintain the supply of these ions to other tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65360 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption#H1206149\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;, section on 'Calcitriol'</a>.)</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency or resistance interferes with these processes, sometimes causing hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Since hypocalcemia stimulates the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH), however, the development of hypocalcemia is often masked. The secondary hyperparathyroidism, via its actions on bone and the kidney, partially corrects the hypocalcemia but enhances urinary phosphate excretion, thereby contributing to the development of hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-osteomalacia#H15280944\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of osteomalacia&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the major causes of vitamin D deficiency and resistance.

Clinicians variably consider the optimal serum 25(OH)D concentration to range between 20 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> or between 30 and 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (75 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. The range of common agreement is 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. This topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Defining vitamin D sufficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VITAMIN D METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) is normally synthesized in the skin under the influence of sunlight in a nonenzymatic manner. In addition, vitamin D (ergocalciferol) may be ingested from fish or plant sources. Vitamin D is then hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol, 25[OH]D), which is the major circulating form of vitamin D and the best index of vitamin D sufficiency. Calcidiol is hydroxylated primarily in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), which is the most active form (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65360 \">figure 1</a>). 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is also formed in some other tissues but is used only within those tissues and not circulated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency can therefore occur as a result of decreased intake or absorption, reduced sun exposure, increased hepatic catabolism, or decreased endogenous synthesis (via decreased 25-hydroxylation in the liver or 1-hydroxylation in the kidney). End-organ resistance to vitamin D causes the equivalent result as deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58837 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCY AND REDUCED CUTANEOUS SYNTHESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many developed countries, most vitamin D is derived from foods that are rich in the vitamin (fatty fishes) or fortified with the vitamin (milk and related products and cereals). The remainder is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol under the influence of ultraviolet light, at a similar wavelength that can cause sunburn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65360 \">figure 1</a>). Vitamin D deficiency can occur in people who live without sun exposure (including those whose skin is constantly protected from the sun) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have enhanced skin pigmentation, or whose dietary intake is low. In some individuals, however, abundant sun exposure does not preclude vitamin D insufficiency for reasons that are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nevertheless, vitamin D deficiency occurs most commonly in people who live in countries distant from the equator and who consume foods that are not fortified with vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Vitamin D deficiency can also occur with adequate intake if there is intestinal malabsorption of vitamin D, as occurs with celiac disease.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency due to reduced vitamin D intake, absorption, or cutaneous production should be considered especially in the following populations:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous vitamin D production and vitamin D stores decline with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This change is most prominent in the winter. In temperate areas such as Boston and Edmonton, as an example, cutaneous production of vitamin D virtually ceases in winter, especially in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>In addition to reduced endogenous production, vitamin D intake is often low in older subjects. As an example, in a study of postmenopausal women living in France, mean daily vitamin D intake from food was 144.8 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day,</span> and more than one-third of women consumed &lt;100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> from food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], despite a recommended intake of 400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> for people 51 to 70 years old and 600 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> for people 71 years old and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Moreover, many clinicians believe that even in those with adequate vitamin D intake, achlorhydria, which is common in older adults, limits calcium absorption, as does an age-dependent resistance to calcitriol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The net effect of the many factors influencing vitamin D metabolism and the effects of vitamin D in older adults is the presence of relative hypocalcemia and high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]; this secondary hyperparathyroidism can be attenuated by the administration of physiological doses of vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, older persons confined indoors may have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol, 25[OH]D) concentrations even with the current recommendations for vitamin D intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary vitamin D deficiency can also occur in children, with notable differences among ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among 618 Asian children in the United Kingdom, 27 percent had serum 25(OH)D &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were correlated with ingestion of vitamin D supplements in these children, notwithstanding that increasing skin pigmentation is associated with less cutaneous vitamin D production. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Immigrants to cold climates from warm climates'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is also a concern for breastfed infants, particularly those with an allergy to cow's milk protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In a study of healthy adults in the Boston area who underwent 25(OH)D testing at the end of winter and summer, 36 percent of 69 subjects ages 18 to 29 had vitamin D concentrations below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> but the prevalence decreased to 4 percent by the end of the summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar seasonal differences were seen in older groups. The impact of winter on the serum 25(OH)D is affected by several ancillary factors, most notably ancestry and skin pigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospitalized patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study of 290 patients hospitalized on a general medical service, vitamin D deficiency (&lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [37 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> was detected in 164 patients (57 percent), of whom 65 (22 percent) were considered severely deficient (serum concentration of 25[OH]D &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Inadequate vitamin D intake, winter season, and housebound status were independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in hospitalized patients may also be dependent, in part, upon the age of the patients on the hospital wards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, in a subgroup of 77 patients less than age 65 years without known risk factors, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was still 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Women treated for osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unrecognized vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is also common in postmenopausal women seeking advice or receiving therapy for osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>]. In a study of 1536 community-dwelling postmenopausal women (evenly distributed by latitude) who were receiving osteoporosis drug therapy (bisphosphonates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a>, or PTH), serum 25(OH)D concentrations were less than 20 and 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in 18 and 52 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

As a result, calcidiol is not hydroxylated to calcitriol, and calcium is not absorbed normally. As a result of the hypocalcemia, parathyroid hormone levels rise, resulting in an increase in urinary excretion of amino acids and phosphate. In addition to these biochemical abnormalities, within the first year of life, patients present with rickets and signs of hypocalcemia, tetany, or convulsions and exhibit muscle weakness and hypotonia, motor retardation, and stunted growth. Laboratory investigations show low serum concentrations of calcium and phosphorus and elevated alkaline phosphatase. With progression, patients develop the classic radiographic signs of vitamin D deficiency rickets and bone biopsy evidence of osteomalacia.

HVDRR, an autosomal recessive disorder, is a very rare form of rickets with approximately 100 cases reported, in which 50 unique heterogeneous mutations in the vitamin D receptor gene have been identified, which change amino acids in either the N-terminal, DNA-binding domain or the C-terminal ligand binding domain of the vitamin D receptor protein, causing end-organ resistance to calcitriol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/46,50-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50-56</a>].</p><p>The clinical spectrum varies widely, probably reflecting the type of mutation within the vitamin D receptor and the amount of residual vitamin D receptor activity. Affected children usually appear normal at birth but develop rickets within the first two years of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53635\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53635 \">image 1</a>). A peculiar feature of the syndrome is alopecia, which appears in approximately two-thirds of cases and is a marker of disease severity. Alopecia results from the lack of vitamin D receptor action within keratinocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>].
