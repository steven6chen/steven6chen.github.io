A small aneurysm often causes no symptoms. But if it grows, an aneurysm can press on nerves inside your brain, causing pain and other symptoms. It can also leak blood or burst, causing a sudden, severe headache.</p><p>A burst aneurysm is a very serious, life-threatening emergency that needs to be treated right away. It leads to a bleeding (hemorrhagic) stroke. Stroke is the term doctors use when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow. The stroke that happens after a brain aneurysm bursts is called a &quot;subarachnoid hemorrhage.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16589349\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a brain aneurysm?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most small brain aneurysms cause no symptoms. But a large aneurysm can cause symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bad headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry or double vision</p><p/><p>If the aneurysm bursts, symptoms can include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sudden, severe headache &ndash; People often say the headache is the worst they have ever had.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stiff neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16589364\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for a brain aneurysm?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of a brain aneurysm, your doctor might do several different tests, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; These tests include a CT scan and an MRI. Both show pictures of your brain. During these tests, you might also get an injection of a dye that makes it easier for doctors to see blood flow in the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a needle into your lower back and takes out a small sample of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. If this fluid has more red blood cells than usual, you could have a subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral angiogram &ndash; For this test, your doctor puts a thin, plastic tube into a large blood vessel, usually near the top of your thigh. Then he or she will advance the tube through your blood vessels past your heart to your brain. Your doctor then injects dye that shows up on an X-ray. This lets the doctor see the blood vessels in your brain and find the aneurysm.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16589379\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a brain aneurysm treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 2 main ways to treat a brain aneurysm:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical clipping &ndash; In this surgery, your doctor puts a tiny metal clip on the base of the aneurysm to stop the blood flow to it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endovascular coiling &ndash; The first part of this treatment is like a cerebral angiogram (see above). But instead of injecting dye into the tube, your doctor advances a soft wire up through your blood vessels into the aneurysm. The wire coils up inside the aneurysm and seals it off from the blood vessel.</p><p/><p>If your aneurysm is leaking or bursts, your doctor will do one of these treatments right away. If it has not burst, you might not be treated. The decision depends on the size of the aneurysm, your age, and whether you have other health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16589394\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there things that make people more likely to have a brain aneurysm?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Having a parent, brother, or sister who had an aneurysm makes you more likely to have one. Other things that can raise your chances include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having high blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking cigarettes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking too much alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using illegal drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking diet pills</p><p/><p>Avoiding these things might help lower your chance of getting an aneurysm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16589411\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=subarachnoid-hemorrhage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
