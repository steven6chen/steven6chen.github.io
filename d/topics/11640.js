Nerve conduction study techniques permit stimulation and recording of electrical activity from individual peripheral nerves with sufficient accuracy, reproducibility, and standardization to determine normal values, characterize abnormal findings, and correlate neurophysiologic-pathologic features.</p><p>These clinical studies are used to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnose focal and generalized disorders of peripheral nerves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classify peripheral nerve conduction abnormalities due to axonal degeneration, demyelination, and conduction block</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosticate regarding clinical course and efficacy of treatment</p><p/><p>This topic will review the late responses (the F waves and H reflex). The late responses are most useful for studying the proximal segments, the plexus and nerve roots, of the peripheral nervous system.</p><p>The clinical study of nerve conduction is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Needle electromyography is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">F WAVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depolarizing peripheral nerves with external stimuli evokes potentials that propagate both proximally and distally. With motor nerves, electrical activity moving distally (orthodromically) results in a direct motor response, the compound muscle action potential (CMAP), also known as the M response. Electrical activity propagating proximally (antidromically) activates a small percentage of motor neurons (they &quot;backfire&quot;), which then can generate another wave known as the F wave (also called the F response). The F wave is visible as a low amplitude late potential following the M response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75038\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75038 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p>The pathway of electrical activity along a motor nerve that ultimately results in a recordable F wave is initially antidromic to the motor neuron, and then orthodromic from the motor neuron, traversing the motor nerve axon through terminal nerve branches, synapses, and muscle fibers. The F wave latency incorporates the conduction times through each of these components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Current physiologic evidence supports this concept of an antidromic and then orthodromic motor neuron pathway, although early theories postulated reflex activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>F waves are recorded using surface electrodes over distal muscles in the same manner as motor nerve conduction studies. The E1 (active) electrode, sited over the muscle belly, has been assumed to be the sole contributor to F wave electrical activity, but a study of tibial nerve F waves demonstrated that the E2 (reference) electrode placed distally over the muscle tendon records significant electrical activity via volume conduction from multiple tibial-innervated foot muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This may affect certain F wave parameters, especially waveform complexity and persistence. Supramaximal nerve stimulation is utilized with the stimulating cathode proximal to the anode to prevent anodal block of the antidromic potential. However, the value of reversing the orientation of the stimulus for obtaining F waves has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Antidromic neural activity can trigger an orthodromic action potential in the same motor neuron by reactivating its initial segment, or axon hillock. Several physiologic phenomena can prevent all motor neurons from being activated with each nerve stimulus, including prolonged refractory periods at the axon hillock, inhibition of recurrent collaterals from motor neuron to motor neuron, and activation of Renshaw interneurons that inhibit smaller motor neurons. These same phenomena reduce the chance of eliciting an F wave with every nerve stimulus, despite the stimulus being supramaximal. Those neurons that do contribute to the F wave may be the largest and fastest conducting myelinated motor fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Observable single F waves result from activation of one to, at most, a few motor neurons, and each F wave results from activation of different subpopulations of motor neurons with each stimulation. This inconsistency in motor neuron activation accounts for the variability in F wave configuration, amplitude, and latency during a series of stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, it is important to record at least 10 to 20 F waves for analysis.</p><p>Analysis of the following F wave parameters is clinically useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean latency, rather than the shortest latency</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronodispersion, the difference between minimal and maximal latencies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean amplitude in relation to the maximum M potential (the mean <span class=\"nowrap\">F/M</span> amplitude ratio)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistence of the F wave, defined as the percentage of stimuli in a series that results in a recordable F wave (normally &gt;50 percent, and usually 80 to 100 percent)</p><p/><p>There is debate as to which F wave parameter is most useful and sensitive with some authors favoring minimal latency and others favoring mean latency or chronodispersion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. F wave persistence and waveform (the F wave configuration and complexity) are also of value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical utility of F waves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>F waves are of particular value in peripheral neuropathies with predominant proximal involvement, such as acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies, in which distal conduction velocities may be normal early in the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They may also be the most sensitive electrodiagnostic test for nerve injury, given the extensive distance the potentials must travel (antidromic plus orthodromic), thus traversing all components of the motor nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study of patients with diabetes mellitus found that among 64 without clinical evidence of polyneuropathy, F wave abnormalities were more common than motor or sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (33 versus 3 percent); similarly among 68 symptomatic patients with polyneuropathy, abnormal F waves were more common than abnormal motor or sensory nerve conduction studies (84 versus 63 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 484 patients with clinically confirmed polyneuropathies, abnormal F wave minimal latencies were significantly more frequent than abnormal nerve conduction studies (97 versus 77 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>However, it is uncertain whether an abnormality in one parameter (eg, F wave minimal latency) seen in one nerve at one time can be used to predict or confirm the diagnosis of a polyneuropathy in asymptomatic patients with or without diabetes.</p><p>F wave minimal latencies of &gt;120 percent of the upper limit of normal (&gt;150 percent if the distal negative peak CMAP amplitude was &lt;80 percent of the lower limit of normal) in each of two nerves indicate primary demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Lesser degrees of F wave slowing may be seen in axonal and mixed polyneuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nevertheless, F wave slowing appears to be highly sensitive for nerve pathology in patients with diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In demyelinating polyneuropathies, there is decreased persistence of F waves with absent F waves in the presence of relatively preserved M responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The value of F waves in focal nerve lesions, such as radiculopathy, is controversial. The American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) concluded that F waves in isolation cannot definitively diagnose radiculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. F wave conduction along longer normal nerve segments may &quot;dilute&quot; any conduction delay across much shorter radicular segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since most peripheral nerves consist of axons from multiple nerve roots, with multiple innervation of the muscles undergoing recording, normal conductivity across unaffected roots may also dilute the abnormalities of the affected root.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">H REFLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The H reflex is a monosynaptic (or, at most, an oligosynaptic) reflex. The afferent arc is mediated by large, fast-conducting group 1a fibers, and the efferent arc is mediated by alpha motor neurons with muscle fiber activation. As such, the neural circuitry is identical to the stretch, or tendon, reflex but bypasses the muscle spindles and gamma-motor system.</p><p>After infancy, the H reflex is most consistently seen with tibial nerve stimulation in the popliteal fossa when recording from the soleus and plantar foot muscles, and less consistently obtained with median nerve stimulation when recording from the flexor carpi radialis. As with tendon reflexes, the H reflex can be enhanced by contraction of the recording muscle and depressed by contraction of antagonist muscles. The soleus H reflex decreases in amplitude with age but can be elicited in 92 percent of healthy people who are age 60 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The typical soleus H reflex latency is approximately 30 msec; the upper limit of normal is 35 msec.</p><p>As opposed to the F wave, the H reflex is visible only with submaximal stimulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81004\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef81004 \">waveform 2</a>). With a slow increase in stimulus strength, the H reflex appears as the stimulus changes from subthreshold to submaximal. The amplitude of the H reflex is greatest just below the threshold for the appearance of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) or M response. With increasing stimulus strength, the H reflex amplitude declines as M response amplitude increases. The H reflex disappears with maximal and supramaximal stimulation, replaced by the F wave, which has a slightly longer latency.</p><p>Stimulus durations of 0.5 to 1.0 msec are necessary for group 1a afferent fiber activation. As with the F wave, the stimulating cathode is proximal to the anode. Several mechanisms may account for the decline and extinction of the H reflex with increasing stimulus strength, including collision of the orthodromic potential from the motor neuron with antidromic activity along the motor axon from the stimulus site, refractoriness of the motor neuron axon hillock, and Renshaw inhibition of the motor neuron pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical utility of H reflex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The H reflex is most commonly used to assess the S1 nerve root in suspected radiculopathies and proximal conduction in polyneuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Unilateral absence of the H reflex or side-to-side differences of &gt;1.5 to 2.0 msec support a focal nerve lesion on the affected side, most commonly at the S1 root, but also at the sacral plexus or sciatic nerve. Because it is a reflex, the H reflex also may be used to study central nervous system functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Examples include the evaluation of spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and intraoperative monitoring during thoracic spine surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F waves are late responses generated by supramaximal nerve stimulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75038\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75038 \">waveform 1</a>).
