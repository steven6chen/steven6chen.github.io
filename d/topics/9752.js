During treatment, the absorption of light energy by intravascular oxyhemoglobin leads to heating and coagulation of lesional blood vessels. The responses of vascular lesions to therapy are influenced by the type of light source used, the clinical characteristics of the target lesion, and patient-specific factors (eg, skin color, patient age). </p><p>Although laser and IPL therapy can result in clinical benefits, treatment is not innocuous. Cutaneous and ocular damage can occur if clinicians are not vigilant. The use of appropriate equipment settings, skin cooling mechanisms, and other safety measures minimize the occurrence of adverse events due to treatment.</p><p>The types of lasers used in the treatment of vascular lesions as well as the efficacy and clinical use of lasers for the treatment of PWS, hemangiomas, and telangiectasias will be discussed here. The general principles of medical lasers, the principles of light therapy for the treatment of skin, and laser and light therapy for lower extremity telangiectasias and veins are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-medical-lasers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of medical lasers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12728454\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The theory of selective photothermolysis describes the method through which lasers or intense pulsed light (IPL) can be used to selectively destroy specific targets in the skin while minimizing damage to other cutaneous structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In concordance with this theory, light energy must be delivered in a manner that results in preferential absorption of light by light-absorbing molecules (chromophores) located within the target. The absorption of light energy by chromophores leads to heating and coagulation of the target. In order to limit collateral damage, the diffusion of heat to adjacent tissues must also be minimized. The principles of laser and light therapy for cutaneous lesions are reviewed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major chromophore targeted during therapy of vascular lesions is generally oxyhemoglobin, although absorption by other hemoglobin species including deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin can also occur. Significant light absorption by oxyhemoglobin occurs in the range of yellow and green light; peak absorption occurs at 418, 542, and 577 nm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A lower peak of light absorption by oxyhemoglobin occurs in the near-infrared light range. Thus, lasers that emit wavelengths of light near the primary absorption peaks of oxyhemoglobin, such as the 585 or 595 nm pulsed dye and the 532 nm frequency-doubled neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers, are often favored for the treatment of vascular lesions. Infrared-range lasers (1064 nm Nd:YAG, alexandrite, or diode) can also be effective for this indication, but are associated with a greater risk for tissue damage and ulceration.</p><p>The potential for light absorption by melanin, another chromophore ubiquitously present in the skin, must be considered prior to the treatment of vascular lesions. Light absorption by melanin progressively increases as wavelengths of light decrease, leading to a relatively higher risk of dyspigmentation secondary to melanin absorption with the use of shorter wavelengths of light. This is of particular concern in patients with dark skin, in whom epidermal melanin is abundant. Epidermal skin cooling techniques and adjustments to laser settings can be used to reduce the incidence of adverse effects secondary to epidermal melanin absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Absorption of light by epidermal melanin can also affect the efficacy of treatment through reducing the amount of light that reaches vessels in the dermis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Skin cooling'</a>.)</p><p>Although the absorption of light by superficial chromophores can influence the amount of light that reaches deep tissues, the wavelength of emitted light is a critical factor for determining the depth to which light penetrates the skin. Longer wavelengths of light are capable of penetrating the skin more deeply than shorter wavelengths. As an example, in a patient with Fitzpatrick skin type II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>), light with a 585 nm wavelength may penetrate roughly 0.65 mm into the skin, while 595 nm may reach a depth of approximately 1 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999082\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Wavelength'</a>.)</p><p>Because short wavelengths of light penetrate the skin only superficially, long wavelengths, such as those in the near-infrared range, are required to reach vessels that are deeper than the upper dermis. This feature plus a relatively high risk of light absorption by epidermal melanin are the primary reasons that lasers with wavelengths near the 418 nm peak of oxyhemoglobin light absorption are generally avoided in the treatment of vascular lesions. Since target vascular lesions often contain vessels at variable depths, using lasers of different wavelengths over the course of several treatments can be useful for achieving desired clinical effects. </p><p>Other laser settings that influence the efficacy of laser and light therapy for vascular lesions include the pulse duration, fluence (energy delivered per unit area), and spot size. Pulse durations equal to or shorter than the vessel thermal relaxation time (time required for a target to lose accumulated heat) are often used to reduce the risk of damage to surrounding structures. Pulse durations that exceed a structure's thermal relaxation time allow the diffusion of heat to adjacent structures, increasing the risk for collateral damage in the skin. The thermal relaxation times for vessels in port wine stains (typically 10 to 300 &mu;m in diameter) range from 1 to 10 ms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Pulse duration'</a>.)</p><p>The pulse duration also affects clinical responses to treatment. Short pulse durations (eg, 0.45 ms) often result in rapid heating and rupture of target vessels, contributing to the appearance of post-treatment purpura, which some cosmetic patients treated for telangiectasias find undesirable. In contrast, long pulse durations deliver light energy over a longer period and allow slower heating of target vessels, preventing sudden vessel rupture and reducing the risk of purpura. Long pulses may also be useful for the destruction of large vessels; large structures lose heat slowly, and the accumulation of heat that occurs over long pulse durations may facilitate coagulation of larger vessels. </p><p>The appropriate laser or IPL setting for the amount of energy delivered to the skin per unit area (fluence) is an important factor for efficacious and safe treatment of vascular lesions. The energy delivered must be sufficient for the chromophore to absorb enough heat to induce vessel coagulation, but should not reach levels that induce excessive damage to the skin. Skin cooling mechanisms can be used to reduce the risk of skin damage associated with the use of high fluences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Fluence'</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;spot size&quot; is used to describe the size of the area through which light is delivered. Large spot sizes minimize scattering of light as it enters the skin, allowing more light to reach the target structure. Large spot sizes also facilitate the treatment of large lesions. A small spot size may be preferred for the treatment of a small, focal telangiectasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Spot size'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12728466\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR LASERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of lasers are used for the treatment of vascular lesions. Specific laser characteristics determine the most appropriate clinical settings for use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113212014\"><span class=\"h2\">Yellow and green light lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High peaks for the absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin occur within the range of yellow and green light. Thus, lasers that emit light in this range are commonly used for the treatment of vascular lesions. However, the restricted depth of penetration of light emitted from these lasers may limit their efficacy for the destruction of vessels located below the superficial dermis. Dyspigmentation is also a risk associated with the use of these lasers, given the relatively high absorption of light in this range by melanin. (See <a href=\"#H12728454\" class=\"local\">'Principles'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3923207\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulsed dye laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (PDL, 585 to 600 nm) has a long history of safe and effective use for vascular lesions. Original 577 nm PDLs were commonly used with pulse durations of approximately 0.45 ms, which is much shorter than the thermal relaxation time of small, superficial vessels (1 to 10 ms). Use of short pulse durations minimizes collateral damage in the skin but also often leads to rapid heating of vessels and vessel rupture, contributing to the appearance of post-treatment temporary purpura. Long-pulse PDLs (595 to 600 nm, pulse duration &ge;1.5 ms) slowly heat target vessels, and can be used without the formation of purpura. However, subpurpuric protocols with long-pulse PDLs may be less effective for the treatment of telangiectasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], and clinical experience suggests similar effects in the treatment of port wine stains (PWS). (See <a href=\"#H461968721\" class=\"local\">'Clinical use'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12728497\"><span class=\"h3\">Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG (KTP) lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency-doubled neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, also known as the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, consists of light from an Nd:YAG laser that is passed through a KTP crystal. The wavelength of this laser is 532 nm, near the 542 nm absorption peak of oxyhemoglobin. Pulse durations of frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers are in the millisecond range, which allows treatment of vascular lesions without the formation of purpura. However, the short wavelength results in a lower depth of skin penetration compared with PDLs. Light emitted by frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers is also absorbed to a greater extent by melanin, augmenting the risk of dyspigmentation, particularly in patients with dark skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113212036\"><span class=\"h2\">Near-infrared lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A secondary, lower peak for the absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin occurs in the near-infrared range (720 to 1200 nm). There is also a small deoxyhemoglobin absorption peak between 750 to 800 nm. Alexandrite (755 nm), diode (800 to 980 nm), and long-pulsed Nd:YAG (1064 nm) lasers are used to capitalize on this absorption and can be effective for the treatment of vascular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The relatively long wavelengths of light emitted by these lasers penetrate the skin to greater depths than is possible with PDL or frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers. Thus, these lasers are generally utilized when vessels deep in the skin are targeted. Pulse durations of these near-infrared lasers are in the millisecond range, facilitating the treatment of larger vessels.</p><p>A disadvantage of near-infrared lasers is that the relatively lower absorption of light by hemoglobin species in this light range demands the use of higher fluences during treatment of vascular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This leads to a greater risk of inadvertent scarring compared with PDLs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113212064\"><span class=\"h2\">Dual wavelength lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dual wavelength lasers including an <span class=\"nowrap\">Nd:YAG/KTP</span> laser that emits 1064 and 532 nm light simultaneously, and a sequentially firing 595 and 1064 nm dual wavelength device have been used for the treatment of resistant vascular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3923257\"><span class=\"h2\">Intense pulsed light</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intense pulsed light sources (IPLs) are non-laser flashlamp devices that produce incoherent, broad bands of light ranging from 515 to 1200 nm. Selective light filters can be used to restrict the emitted wavelengths to a narrower range for a more specific tissue effect. </p><p>IPLs have versatility, as they generate a wide range of light wavelengths, pulse durations, and pulse sequences. However, treatment of some types of vascular lesions with IPL can require more sessions than laser therapy to achieve the same clinical effect (see <a href=\"#H368860431\" class=\"local\">'Other lasers and IPL'</a> below). Another potentially detrimental feature of IPL is the emission of wavelengths of light highly absorbed by epidermal melanin, which leads to a relatively high risk of pigmentary adverse effects. Use of skin cooling techniques during IPL therapy is essential for reducing this risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10061356\"><span class=\"h1\">PORT WINE STAINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Port wine stains (PWS) are congenital capillary malformations characterized by pink to erythematous to violaceous patches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73343%7EDERM%2F60560%7EDERM%2F54078\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73343 graphicRef60560 graphicRef54078 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Lesions may be extensive, and papular and nodular components often develop during adulthood. PWS can lead to psychological distress in some patients, and complications such as nodules, bleeding, pyogenic granulomas, and tissue hypertrophy can occur in mature lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Isolated lesions do occur, but PWS may also be associated with several syndromes that should be considered when these patients present.

In general, appropriate parameters for PDL treatment of PWS include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wavelength: 585 to 600 nm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse duration: 0.45 to 10 msec</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluence: 4.5 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spot size: at least 7 mm</p><p/><p>The 595 nm PDL with variable pulse durations has become the laser most frequently used for the treatment of PWS. Compared with the traditional 585 nm PDL, light from the 595 nm PDL is able to penetrate the skin to a slightly greater depth. In addition, the ability to deliver pulse durations in the millisecond range (typically 1.5 to 6 ms) may facilitate the destruction of larger vessels. Despite these theoretical advantages of the 595 PDL, studies conflict on whether treatment with the 595 nm PDL is clinically more effective than the 585 nm short-pulsed laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. However, a case report and the results of a small prospective study suggest that some patients who have failed to improve adequately with the 585 nm PDL benefit from treatment with a 595 nm long-pulsed PDL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Appropriate initial PDL fluence settings vary. Factors such as patient age, skin color, lesion morphology, lesion location, laser type, and laser spot size determine the correct fluence setting. Adequate epidermal cooling techniques reduce the risk of epidermal damage and scarring and allow the use of higher fluences in the hands of experienced clinicians. Epidermal cooling is particularly important in patients with dark skin, in whom inadequate cooling is likely to result in hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. </p><p>When treating a PWS on the cheek in an older child or adult with Fitzpatrick skin phototype II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>), appropriate initial fluence settings for a 595 long-pulsed PDL with a 10 mm spot size and a dynamic epidermal cooling mechanism generally range from 5.5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span>. Lower initial fluences are typically used for young children, individuals with dark skin, and lesions in areas at higher risk for cutaneous damage, such as the eyelid. Depending on the response to treatment, fluences can be increased by 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> with subsequent treatments if desired results are not achieved and no adverse effects are noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Large spot sizes (&ge;7 mm) are generally preferred, as they minimize light scattering, and thus allow greater delivery of light energy to target structures. Large spot sizes also facilitate the treatment of large PWS. Although the impact of patient-positioning during treatment has not been specifically studied, we typically place the treatment site in a dependent position (eg, Trendelenburg position for facial lesions) immediately prior to treatment to increase local blood volume, which theoretically may increase the size of the vascular target. </p><p>Treatment should be performed in a methodical fashion, with care to maintain the position of the laser perpendicular to the surface of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80239\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80239 \">picture 2</a>). This also ensures the proper delivery of cooling when using lasers with integrated cooling technology. Overlapping pulses by approximately 10 percent reduces the amount of untreated space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The frequency with which treatments are administered varies in the literature, ranging from every few weeks to every few months. We typically administer PDL treatments every four to six weeks for facial lesions. Other clinicians have used shorter intervals successfully. In a retrospective study of 24 infants with facial PWS (Fitzpatrick skin phototype I to III), treatment intervals of two, three, or four weeks were effective for improving PWS and were well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>We may use longer intervals (six to eight weeks) for patients with dark skin types (Fitzpatrick phototype IV or higher) or with extremity lesions, if there is postinflammatory pigmentation change. Longer time intervals between sessions allow for treatment and improvement of hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation can reduce treatment efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H368860500\" class=\"local\">'Precautions'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment can be continued until lesions are clear or nearly clearly or until no further improvement is noted; typically, 3 to more than 15 sessions are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Variations in vessel size and depth within a particular lesion promote the value of utilizing more than one set of PDL parameters over the course of treatment of a PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Retreating areas during the same treatment session (multiple pass technique) may also be beneficial for facial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The pulse duration or laser wavelength can also be altered with subsequent passes. Multiple passes should only be performed by clinicians experienced in laser treatment due to an increased risk for scarring. The risk for scarring with this technique may be higher for lesions in other locations.</p><p>Local or general anesthesia or administration of pain medications prior to treatment may be used as needed. Pain medications that inhibit clotting, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, should be avoided.

Immediate purpura is the desired tissue response during PDL treatment for PWS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59618\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59618 \">picture 3</a>). PDL-induced purpura typically resolves within 10 to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The appearance of a gray or white color on the skin after the delivery of a laser pulse denotes epidermal injury and should be avoided.</p><p>Local edema and sunburn-like pain are common after treatment. Elevation, ice packs, nonprescription oral analgesics, and bland topical emollients are useful for decreasing patient discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Post-treatment sun avoidance should be recommended to reduce the risk of subsequent hyperpigmentation. For patients with skin color classified as Fitzpatrick phototype III or higher as well as patients with lighter skin who develop post-treatment hyperpigmentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>), we typically prescribe daily application of a bleaching cream, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> 4%, between treatment sessions to further decrease the risk of this adverse effect. Daily application of hydroquinone should begin immediately after the resolution of purpura, and should continue until the next treatment. Because irritant dermatitis can also induce hyperpigmentation, we decrease the frequency of application or discontinue topical bleaching agents in patients who develop skin irritation secondary to these drugs. </p><p>Blistering, scarring, cutaneous atrophy, and hypopigmentation are additional potential adverse effects of PDL therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368860431\"><span class=\"h2\">Other lasers and IPL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who fail to improve with PDL, other laser therapies can be tried [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/8,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,40-42</a>]. In a prospective study of 30 patients with PWS resistant to PDL, lesion color improved at least 25 percent in 16 patients (53 percent) after treatment with a modulated 532 nm frequency-doubled neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Most hemangiomas are managed conservatively, with close observation for the development of complications. Topical therapies, systemic medications, and occasionally surgical intervention are used for the treatment of hemangiomas that require treatment secondary to the impairment of vital functions (eg, vision or feeding) or ulceration. Patients with proliferating lesions in sites that are likely to leave significant deformities following involution are also often considered for therapy. Laser therapy has emerged as an additional therapeutic option; however, study results vary on the efficacy of this treatment.

Interpretation of the literature is further complicated by the natural course towards lesional involution, variations in laser settings among studies, and the evolution of laser technology over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/64,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,66</a>]. </p><p>Although a beneficial effect of PDL therapy has been reported in a meta-analysis of 13 observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], the contradictory results of a randomized trial raised controversy over the use of PDL for this indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The trial found that the number of children with complete hemangioma clearance at one year was significantly greater in the group treated with a 585 nm PDL without epidermal cooling technology (fluence 6 to 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> spot size 3 to 5 mm, pulse duration 0.45 ms) than in the observation group (30 versus 5 percent, respectively). However, no difference between the groups was detected when the sum of patients with either complete clearance or minimal residual signs of hemangioma at one year were analyzed. In addition, lesion redness was the only objective measure that was found to significantly improve with treatment, and adverse effects of skin atrophy and hypopigmentation occurred at a higher rate in the treated group. Given the lack of use of modern epidermal cooling techniques and the small spot sizes used, the applicability of the results to current practice have been questioned.</p><p>Integrated cooling techniques allow the safe use of higher and potentially more effective fluences. This fact, plus the theoretical potential for deeper skin penetration with the 595 nm PDL compared with the 585 nm PDL, led to the use of 595 nm PDLs with integrated cooling technology for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas. The following studies support the use of these lasers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of 121 infants with hemangiomas, the efficacy of a 595 nm PDL with cryogen spray cooling technology (fluence 9 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> spot size 7 mm, pulse duration 10 to 20 ms) was compared with a 585 nm PDL without cooling technology (fluence 5.5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> spot size 7 mm, pulse duration 0.45 ms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

In addition, in an 18-year-old woman with residual fibrofatty tissue and redundant skin at the site of a previous facial hemangioma, treatment with a nonablative 1440 nm fractionated laser led to marked clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10061370\"><span class=\"h1\">TELANGIECTASIAS AND THE RED FACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Telangiectasias are common lesions that present as 0.1 to 1 mm diameter vascular dilatations that are visible on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71614\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71614 \">picture 5</a>). Telangiectasias occur spontaneously or arise in the setting of other conditions, such as cutaneous photodamage, rosacea, connective tissue or liver disease, radiation, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and long term topical corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Patients with numerous telangiectasias on the face frequently present with a complaint of facial redness.<strong> </strong></p><p>Telangiectasias and secondary facial redness do not require treatment, but lesions that are cosmetically distressing for patients can be removed with electrocautery or lasers. Lasers provide quick and effective therapy, particularly for multiple telangiectasias, large areas with telangiectasias, or lesions that have failed to resolve after electrocautery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461968721\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of light sources are effective for the treatment of telangiectasias. PDLs are among the most commonly used; however, frequency-doubled neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers and IPL are also effective. Lasers with longer wavelengths, such as the alexandrite, diode, and Nd:YAG are useful for targeting larger vessels that are located deeper in the skin. Laser spot sizes, and in some cases, the spot shape (round versus elliptical), can be adjusted to conform to the size or shape of the target vessel.</p><p>PDL therapy can result in temporary purpura, which is viewed as unfavorable by many patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59618\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59618 \">picture 3</a>). Purpura can be minimized or eliminated by use of long pulse durations (&ge;6 ms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]; however, treatment with subpurpuric laser settings may be less efficacious, contributing to the need for additional treatment sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The efficacy of purpura-inducing versus subpurpuric PDL settings was investigated in the following studies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a split-face comparison study of nine patients with facial telangiectasias and erythema treated with a 595 nm long-pulse (6 ms) PDL, purpuric fluences were more effective at reducing vessel diameter and arborization of telangiectasias than multiple passes with subpurpuric laser settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Subpurpuric fluences were more effective for the reduction of background erythema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a split-face, nonblinded randomized trial in which patients were treated with a 595 nm PDL (10 ms pulse duration) at either purpuric or subpurpuric fluences, purpura-inducing treatments were more effective. The greatest benefit of treatment was observed in thick, dense telangiectasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Multiple passes or judicious pulse stacking can be used to improve treatment response when longer pulse durations are utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/38,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,88</a>]. Pulse stacking involves the immediate delivery of repeated pulses (usually two to three) to the same treatment area in an attempt to increase cumulative heating of the target vessels, while allowing sufficient time for epidermal cooling between pulses. Multiple passes and pulse stacking techniques should only be used by experienced clinicians. Cutaneous damage may occur if incorrect settings are used or if the skin response to treatment is not properly monitored.</p><p>Millisecond pulsed 532 nm frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers and IPL can also be used to treat facial telangiectasias with minimal to no purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461968728\"><span class=\"h2\">Precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in other settings, the risks of laser therapy for telangiectasias include pigmentary alteration, blistering, ulceration, and scarring. Risks of ulceration and scarring are higher with long wavelength lasers, such as the 1064 nm Nd:YAG and 755 nm alexandrite lasers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10061377\"><span class=\"h1\">ROSACEA ASSOCIATED ERYTHEMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rosacea is a multi-faceted disease that can present with a variety of cutaneous morphologies, including telangiectasias, erythema, inflammatory acneiform lesions, and rhinophyma.</p><p>Rosacea-associated telangiectasias are managed similarly to other telangiectasias. Laser and light sources also are commonly used for facial erythema secondary to rosacea, and based upon our clinical experiences, treatment also can provide relief from accompanying symptoms of burning and stinging. (See <a href=\"#H10061370\" class=\"local\">'Telangiectasias and the red face'</a> above.)</p><p>Multiple light based treatments are generally required to achieve the desired clinical response. Intermittent therapy is often necessary to maintain improvement after the completion of a successful treatment course.

Clinical personnel must wear laser safety goggles that specifically protect against the wavelength of the laser used. </p><p>Patient protective eyewear depends on the location to be treated. If nonfacial areas are to be treated, patients may wear laser safety goggles similar to those of the clinical staff. For treatment of the face outside of the periorbital area, protective pads specific for laser procedures or metal goggles padded with a thin layer of gauze can be used. Corneal shields inserted with the aid of ocular anesthetic drops and lubricant are required when the eyelid or immediate periorbital area is treated. Appropriate sizing and placement of the patient's eyewear should always be confirmed prior to starting a procedure. </p><p>Eye injury has been reported when long pulsed longer wavelength (755 and 1064 nm) lasers were used within the bony orbit, even with appropriate eye protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Use of these devices in the periorbital area should be avoided or approached with extreme caution.</p><p>Lasers have been reported to cause flash fires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. To avoid this, alcohol used to clean instruments or skin must be completely dry before starting the procedure. Fire extinguishers should be immediately available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10061407\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anesthesia generally is not required for small lesions. Topical anesthetics can be used, although some preparations (eg, eutectic mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a>, EMLA) may blanch the vessels. This may remove the target, minimizing treatment response. Local anesthetic injections or regional nerve blocks can also be utilized; however, epinephrine (a vasoconstrictor) should be avoided to prevent vessel constriction and target removal.</p><p>General anesthesia may be helpful to ensure safe and complete treatment of large lesions (PWS or hemangiomas) in infants, children, and some adults. The multiple treatments required and the use of protective eyewear, especially corneal shields, can be difficult for children. General anesthesia is routinely used for large lesions in children over the age of six months at the author's academic center.</p><p>General anesthesia performed by experienced anesthesiologists in otherwise healthy children has been reported to be quite safe, although there are some risks. Families should be provided information to make informed decisions. One study reported no serious adverse events in a multicenter report of 881 dermatologic procedures performed on children aged 2 months to 18 years with general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. In another study, 363 infants were randomly assigned to receive awake-regional anesthesia and 359 to receive sevoflurane-based general anesthesia during inguinal herniorrhaphy, and neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at two years of age. No difference in neurodevelopmental outcome was noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461968785\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) are treatment options for a variety of vascular lesions, including port wine stains (PWS), infantile hemangiomas, and telangiectasias. (See <a href=\"#H10061257\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of lasers and IPL for vascular lesions stems from the absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin and other hemoglobin species (deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin) in lesional vessels. Yellow and green light and, to a lesser extent, near-infrared light are preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin species. Light sources that emit light in these ranges generally are used for the treatment of vascular lesions. (See <a href=\"#H12728454\" class=\"local\">'Principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulsed dye lasers (PDLs) are commonly used for the treatment of vascular lesions. For young patients with PWS who desire treatment, we recommend treatment with PDL over other therapies as first-line treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We typically utilize a 595 nm PDL with pulse duration of 0.45 ms or greater and an integrated mechanism to cool the epidermis. Fluences that induce purpura should be used, and multiple treatments are required to achieve significant improvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Millisecond pulsed near-infrared lasers such as the 755 nm alexandrite or 1064 neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser may be useful for the treatment of thick or nodular PWS. However, the risk of scarring with long wavelength lasers exceeds risk with PDL, and the use of these lasers for PWS should be restricted to experienced clinicians. Other treatment options for PWS include the 532 nm frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser, diode laser, and intense pulsed light (IPL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PWS in young children and lesions in certain locations may be more likely respond to therapy. Recurrence of PWS after treatment may occur. (See <a href=\"#H2421284\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of PDL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser treatment may be beneficial for select infantile hemangiomas. Small superficial, ulcerated, or involuting lesions exhibit the best responses to therapy. Evidence conflicts on whether early treatment of superficial hemangiomas inhibits future growth. (See <a href=\"#H12910462\" class=\"local\">'Infantile hemangiomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For ulcerated hemangiomas that fail to heal with local wound care, treatment with PDL is an option. In some cases, a single treatment is sufficient to induce healing of an ulcer. (See <a href=\"#H175204223\" class=\"local\">'Ulceration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telangiectasias are common, benign vascular lesions that are amenable to laser therapy. PDL and other vascular lasers can be effective for these lesions.
