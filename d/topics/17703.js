Each of these terms has both useful and problematic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease#H272267074\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>). A European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) consensus panel rigorously reviewed the literature regarding CPP crystal deposition and proposed changes in nomenclature, summarized levels of evidence regarding diagnosis, and made recommendations for management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] &#160; A commentary has also been published concerning the EULAR committee recommendations, authored by experts from the United States, that generally supports use of the EULAR terminology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (also abbreviated as CPPD disease) as the umbrella term for all instances of CPP crystal occurrence.</p><p>In view of its wider acceptance in the literature, we will place primary emphasis on the EULAR task force terminology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] in the discussion below. Nevertheless, despite their limitations, the clinical syndromes and findings implied by the traditional terms are likely to be retained by some clinicians on the basis of their resemblances to common clinical disorders familiar to the clinician. Familiarity with the older nomenclature may, in addition, be useful in instances where literature searches using only the EULAR task force terms overlook citations indexed under the traditional terms. For these reasons, the traditional terms appear in parentheses following the EULAR designation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic CPPD disease (asymptomatic CPPD)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute CPP crystal arthritis ('acute pseudogout')'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic CPP crystal arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis (pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis) (see <a href=\"#H3678803\" class=\"local\">'Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis ('pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis')'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD, with or without superimposed acute attacks (pseudo-OA) (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Joint degeneration ('OA with CPPD')'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe joint degeneration (pseudo-neuropathic joint disease) (see <a href=\"#H754627578\" class=\"local\">'Severe joint degeneration/Pseudo-neuropathic joint disease'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal involvement</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272267743\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of acute calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystal arthritis (&quot;acute pseudogout&quot;) is aimed at reducing the pain and disability associated with the inflammatory response to CPP crystal deposition (CPPD) and is modeled on the treatment of acute gout (acute monosodium urate crystal deposition disease), the other major form of acute crystalline arthritis (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute CPP crystal arthritis ('acute pseudogout')'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis for acute CPP crystal arthritis'</a> below). However, the evidence directly examining and supporting this approach is quite limited. In patients in whom a disease associated with CPPD is present, specific therapy directed at the underlying disorder should be initiated; however, such interventions usually do not reverse CPPD disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease#H96915146\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;, section on 'Post-diagnostic evaluation for associated diseases'</a>.)</p><p>Approaches to the treatment and prophylaxis of acute CPP crystal arthritis, and for the treatment of chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis or degenerative joint disease, are utilized as necessitated by the clinical presentation (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute CPP crystal arthritis ('acute pseudogout')'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3678803\" class=\"local\">'Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis ('pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis')'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Chronic and progressive calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Joint degeneration ('OA with CPPD')'</a> below). These treatment approaches are based upon clinical experience and not upon controlled trials. The aforementioned European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) panel has made a careful analysis of the scant literature supporting treatment strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In general, their recommendations concur with ours, but the limitations of these recommendations and the importance of further clinical research in CPPD disease have also been noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE CPP CRYSTAL ARTHRITIS ('ACUTE PSEUDOGOUT')</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One approach or, more often, a combination of approaches, including local and systemic measures, is appropriate for the treatment of attacks of acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis. The initial treatment interventions depend upon the number of involved joints and whether joint injections are feasible. (See <a href=\"#H80245370\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment/one or two joints'</a> below and <a href=\"#H80245789\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment/more than two joints'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80245370\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment/one or two joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our preferred treatment for acute CPP crystal arthritis includes the administration of antiinflammatory medication, usually by intraarticular injection, supported by local measures to reduce symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis with no more than two acutely inflamed joints, we suggest thorough joint aspiration and intraarticular glucocorticoid injection as initial treatment rather than using oral antiinflammatory agents. In patients in whom joint injection is not feasible, alternative measures should be used. (See <a href=\"#H80245789\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment/more than two joints'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Joint injection should be performed only when the likelihood of a septic joint, which can be mistaken for acute crystal-induced synovitis, has been deemed unlikely. Characteristics that make an infection less likely include the absence of systemic signs and symptoms, such as fever, rash, and associated foci of infection, and the absence of local signs such as a purulent appearing synovial fluid. In patients suspected of infection, glucocorticoid injection should be deferred until synovial fluid culture is negative, and interventions other than glucocorticoid injection should be employed. Absence of infection is further supported by a lack of microorganisms on Gram stain, and by sterile synovial fluid and blood cultures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For injections into large joints, including the knees and shoulders, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (1 mL, 40 mg) mixed with 1 or 2 mL of 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. When smaller joints are involved, smaller doses of the respective glucocorticoid preparations can be utilized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;, section on 'Choice of glucocorticoid preparation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;, section on 'Should the glucocorticoid be mixed with a local anesthetic?'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Joint fluid aspiration and glucocorticoid injection usually provide relief in pain and swelling within 8 to 24 hours. However, the occurrence of a worsening of symptoms shortly after aspiration and injection, a failure to achieve even a partial response within 48 to 72 hours, or the development of additional inflamed joints may necessitate use of the same measures used in patients with multiple involved joints, such as a brief addition of an oral antiinflammatory medication (a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [NSAID], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, or a glucocorticoid), with prompt discontinuation as the flare subsides (see <a href=\"#H80245789\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment/more than two joints'</a> below). Patients resistant to these approaches may require additional or alternative measures. (See <a href=\"#H80246998\" class=\"local\">'Resistant disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive measures used for symptomatic relief include application of ice or cool packs and immobilization and resting of the joint by restriction of weightbearing or routine joint use in all patients for 48 to 72 hours, employing splints when necessary. The use of these strategies is based largely upon our clinical experience and the similar experience of other experts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80245789\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment/more than two joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When more than two joints are inflamed, focused joint injection is usually an impractical approach. In this setting, systemic antiinflammatory therapy is warranted, employing agents typically used for the treatment of acute gout (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gout-flares\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gout flares&quot;</a>). These include: NSAIDs, which may, however, be contraindicated in older adults, the population especially susceptible to acute attacks of pseudogout (see <a href=\"#H80246373\" class=\"local\">'NSAIDs'</a> below); <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, which is particularly useful if a low-dose regimen is initiated within hours of attack onset (see <a href=\"#H80246466\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine'</a> below); and glucocorticoids, which are efficacious in patients unable to take NSAIDs or colchicine (see <a href=\"#H80246815\" class=\"local\">'Unable to use oral NSAIDs and colchicine'</a> below). The choice of which oral antiinflammatory to prescribe is largely determined by patient clinical features and history of the patient's current and prior flares rather than inherently superior efficacy of any one of these classes of antiinflammatory agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gout-flares#H11160517\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gout flares&quot;, section on 'General therapeutic principles'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gout-flares#H85444272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gout flares&quot;, section on 'Initial treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Analgesic medications (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or opioids) or NSAIDs at analgesic rather than antiinflammatory dose are frequently prescribed for acute crystal-induced arthritis but should not substitute for the use of medications with antiinflammatory properties at the doses provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80246373\"><span class=\"h3\">NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis who are not treated with arthrocentesis and injection, we suggest NSAIDs administered in antiinflammatory doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 500 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> 50 mg three times daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a> 200 mg twice daily). Although indomethacin is highly effective in our experience, we prefer to avoid its use in patients at higher risk, including those with heart failure, peripheral edema, NSAID gastropathy, or cognitive impairment.

Except in circumstances when treatment is initiated within 24 hours of flare onset, NSAID treatment is more likely than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, in our experience, to provide pain relief and reduced disability within 24 to 48 hours in acute oligo- or polyarticular CPP crystal arthritis. In patients suited for NSAID use, a brief flare-limited course of NSAID agents achieves flare relief in about the same timeframe as oral glucocorticoids with less likelihood of rebound flares, as often occurs when glucocorticoid doses are rapidly tapered. We would consider failure to result in flare symptom relief in 48 to 72 hours as a sign of an inadequate response and an indication to switch to glucocorticoid treatment.</p><p>We also generally prefer nonselective NSAIDs over other agents because they are inexpensive, readily available to patients at the onset of an attack (some without a prescription), and, in our experience, as effective and at least as safe as other agents. NSAIDs are most effective if treatment is initiated within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. The dose may be reduced after a significant reduction in symptoms has occurred, but the frequency of dosing should be maintained for several more days for optimal antiinflammatory effect. High-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> (a single dose of 800 mg followed by 400 mg twice daily), a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitor, is an alternative to nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] but has not been studied in randomized trials for acute CPP crystal arthritis.</p><p>The NSAID can be discontinued one or two days after clinical signs have completely resolved. Typically, the total duration of NSAID therapy for an acute attack is five to seven days. It is likely to be shorter in patients treated within the first 24 hours of symptom onset and may be longer in patients in whom treatment is not begun until several days later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80246466\"><span class=\"h3\">Colchicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients in whom treatment for acute CPP crystal arthritis is initiated within about 24 hours of onset and whose clinical and concomitant medication profiles permit its consideration, we suggest oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> in a low-dose regimen as initially recommended for the treatment of acute gout, rather than using oral glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. For regimens using low-dose colchicine, no more than 1.8 mg of colchicine is taken orally in the first 24 hours of treatment, followed by 0.6 mg colchicine taken twice daily until the attack abates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The use of colchicine in acute pseudogout is supported by similarities in the mechanisms of acute CPP crystal and acute monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation, the recommendation of the EULAR expert consensus group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and our clinical experience.</p><p>The approach to the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> is the same as in patients with acute gout.

A response to oral glucocorticoid therapy is usually seen within two to three days, particularly if the flare is limited to one or two joints, but may take longer in the case of a greater number of inflamed sites. If a response to oral glucocorticoid therapy is not evident, parenteral glucocorticoids may be required.

If it was not already performed earlier in the attack, arthrocentesis may be required to exclude other causes of a flare of acute inflammatory arthritis, including infection. It is important not to become overly concerned if attacks do not begin to resolve within one to three days of starting treatment, because most acute pseudogout flares resolve within 7 to 14 days. Regardless of the type of therapy, resolution of the joint flare and the accompanying physical disability are much more rapid if the patient is treated early in the attack.
