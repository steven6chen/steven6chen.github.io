During the ensuing two decades, serologic assays were established for HBsAg and other HBV antigens and antibodies. Advances in molecular biology techniques led to the development of hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for direct determination of hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA). The diagnosis of HBV infection can also be made by the detection of HBsAg or hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in liver tissues by immunohistochemical staining and of HBV DNA by Southern hybridization, in-situ hybridization, or PCR.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the changes in hepatitis B antigens, antibodies, and DNA levels that occur during acute and chronic infection and how these tests can be used clinically. A diagnostic algorithm will be presented for using these tests to diagnose acute hepatitis, past infection, and chronic infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136182310\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD BE TESTED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is indicated for those with signs and symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis.

This is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic algorithms'</a> below.) </p><p>For screening of asymptomatic persons, we generally test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). Additional screening for IgG hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can also be done and will help differentiate immunity from HBV vaccination (anti-HBc <span class=\"nowrap\">negative/anti-HBs</span> positive) versus recovery from past HBV infection (anti-HBc <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/anti-HBs</span> positive). It will also identify persons with past or occult HBV infection (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic algorithms'</a> below). Testing for anti-HBc is particularly important in persons who require immunosuppressive therapy, as HBV reactivation can occur in those who had past HBV infection (anti-HBc <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/HBsAg</span> negative).

These markers are used to define different clinical states (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81182 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the serologic hallmark of HBV infection. It can be detected using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA).</p><p>HBsAg appears in serum 1 to 10 weeks after an acute exposure to HBV, prior to the onset of hepatitic symptoms or elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69344 \">figure 1</a>). In patients who subsequently recover, HBsAg usually becomes undetectable after four to six months. Persistence of HBsAg for more than six months implies chronic infection. It is estimated that less than 5 percent of immunocompetent adult patients with genuine acute hepatitis B progress to chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among patients with chronic HBV infection, the rate of clearance of HBsAg is approximately 0.5 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The disappearance of HBsAg is followed by the appearance of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). In most patients, anti-HBs persists for life, thereby conferring long-term immunity. In some patients, however, anti-HBs may not be detectable until after a window period of several weeks to months, during which <strong>neither</strong> HBsAg nor anti-HBs can be detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65368 \">figure 2</a>). At this time, the serologic diagnosis may be made by the detection of IgM antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) (see below).</p><p>HBV can be classified into at least eight genotypes and four major serotypes. All HBV serotypes share one common antigenic determinant: &quot;a&quot;. These serotypes have epidemiologic significance. Antibodies to the &quot;a&quot; determinant confer protection to all HBV serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs has been reported in 5 to 30 percent of HBsAg positive individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In most instances, the antibodies are unable to neutralize the circulating virions. These individuals should therefore be regarded as carriers of the hepatitis B virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis B core antigen and antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is an intracellular antigen that is expressed in infected hepatocytes. It is <strong>not</strong> detectable in serum. Anti-HBc can be detected throughout the course of HBV infection.</p><p>During acute infection, anti-HBc is predominantly of IgM class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69344 \">figure 1</a>). IgM anti-HBc is the sole marker of HBV infection during the window period between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65368 \">figure 2</a>). The detection of IgM anti-HBc is usually regarded as an indication of acute HBV infection.</p><p>However, IgM anti-HBc may remain detectable up to two years after the acute infection. Furthermore, the titer of IgM anti-HBc may increase to detectable levels during exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This can present a diagnostic problem, incorrectly suggesting acute hepatitis B, particularly in endemic areas in which many HBsAg-positive patients presenting with acute hepatitis actually have exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17</a>]. Other common causes of acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B are superinfection with hepatitis D virus (delta virus) or hepatitis C virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>IgG anti-HBc persists along with anti-HBs in patients who recover from acute hepatitis B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60627%7EGAST%2F60827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60627 graphicRef60827 \">table 3A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69344 \">figure 1</a>). It also persists in association with HBsAg in those who progress to chronic HBV infection.</p><p>Some investigators have noted a correlation between the titer of IgM anti-HBc and serum alanine aminotransferase, serum HBV DNA levels and histologic inflammation in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, the studies correlating IgM anti-HBc titer with HBV replication or activity of liver disease were performed using quantitative IgM anti-HBc assays that have lower cutoffs than the qualitative assays available in the United States. The latter assays were designed for diagnosis of acute HBV infection, and have higher cutoffs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Isolated anti-HBc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The isolated presence of anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg and anti-HBs has been reported in 0.4 to 1.7 percent of blood donors in low prevalence areas and in 10 to 20 percent of the population in endemic countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Isolated detection of anti-HBc can occur in three settings: during the window period of acute hepatitis B when the anti-HBc is predominantly IgM class; many years after recovery from acute hepatitis B when anti-HBs has fallen to undetectable levels; and after many years of chronic HBV infection when the HBsAg titer has decreased below the cutoff level for detection. As noted above, loss of detectable HBsAg occurs in approximately 0.5 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis B per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody'</a> above.)</p><p>In some cases, isolated anti-HBc may be due to a false positive test result. Thus, the evaluation of individuals with isolated anti-HBc should include repeat testing for anti-HBc, HBsAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HBs. In addition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who remain positive for isolated anti-HBc IgG, have evidence of a recent HBV exposure, have symptoms of acute hepatitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have markedly elevated ALT levels should be tested for the presence of anti-HBc IgM to rule out recent HBV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Clinical manifestations and natural history&quot;, section on 'Acute hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with evidence of chronic liver disease should be tested for HBV DNA to exclude low level chronic HBV infection. HBV DNA has been detected in the serum of individuals with isolated anti-HBc when tested by PCR assays; however, the frequency of detection varies from 0 to 20 percent with most studies showing &lt;5 percent detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Clinical manifestations and natural history&quot;, section on 'Chronic hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In the late 1980s, it was suggested that as many as 50 to 80 percent of persons with isolated anti-HBc had false positive test results, based upon studies that demonstrated the development of a primary anti-HBs response to hepatitis B vaccination of asymptomatic individuals with isolated anti-HBc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. However, improvements of enzyme immunoassays in the past decade have decreased the rate of false positive results.</p><p>The clinical significance of isolated anti-HBc is unclear. Occult HBV infection (ie, isolated anti-HBc with a detectable HBV DNA) has been associated with chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Occult HBV infection'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, transmission of HBV infection has been reported from blood and organ donors with isolated anti-HBc. Although the incidence ranges widely (from 0.4 to 78 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21-23</a>], the risk is highest when a liver from anti-HBc positive donors are transplanted. This may be due in part to the high percentage of patients with isolated anti-HBc (&gt;70 percent) who have HBV DNA detected in the liver. Transmission can occur even when the serum HBV DNA is negative. As an example, de novo HBV infection developed in 9 out of 64 (14 percent) liver transplant recipients who were anti-HBc-negative and received a liver from a donor who was anti-HBc positive, but HBsAg and HBV DNA-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A discussion of how to prevent HBV infection in this setting is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'De novo HBV infection/reactivation'</a>.)</p><p>Reactivation of HBV replication with reverse seroconversion (ie, reappearance of HBsAg) can also occur in patients with isolated anti-HBc in the setting of intense immunosuppression. Prophylactic antiviral therapy may reduce the risk of reactivation in certain patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis B e antigen and antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is a secretory protein that is processed from the precore protein. It is generally considered to be a marker of HBV replication and infectivity. The presence of HBeAg is usually associated with high levels of HBV DNA in serum and higher rates of transmission of HBV infection from carrier mothers to their babies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>] and from patients to health care workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion occurs early in patients with acute infection, prior to HBsAg to anti-HBs seroconversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69344 \">figure 1</a>). However, HBeAg seroconversion may be delayed for years to decades in patients with chronic HBV infection. In such patients, the presence of HBeAg is usually associated with the detection of high levels of HBV DNA in serum and active liver disease. However, HBeAg-positive patients with perinatally acquired HBV infection may have normal serum ALT concentrations and minimal inflammation in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe is usually associated with a decrease in serum HBV DNA and remission of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, some patients continue to have active liver disease after HBeAg seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Such individuals may have low levels of wild type HBV or HBV variants with a stop codon in the precore or dual nucleotide substitutions in the core promoter region that prevent or decrease the production of HBeAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum HBV DNA assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Qualitative and quantitative tests for HBV DNA in serum have been developed to assess HBV replication. The sensitivity limit of these assays depends upon the techniques used. The range of linearity also varies. Currently, most HBV DNA assays use real-time PCR techniques, report results in international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> have lower limit of detection around 10 to 20 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and a range of linearity up to 8 log(10) international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. </p><p>Recovery from acute hepatitis B is usually accompanied by the disappearance of HBV DNA in serum as determined by hybridization or bDNA assays. However, HBV DNA may remain detectable in serum for many years if tested by PCR assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This observation suggests that the virus persists after &quot;recovery&quot; but is controlled by the immune system.</p><p>Similar findings have been noted in patients with chronic HBV infection. Spontaneous or treatment-induced HBeAg seroconversion is usually accompanied by the disappearance of HBV DNA from serum by hybridization methods, but PCR assays usually remain positive except in patients with HBsAg seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A study of 49 patients who had <span class=\"nowrap\">spontaneous/interferon</span> induced HBeAg clearance found a wide range in HBV DNA levels at the time HBeAg first became undetectable, implying that there is no threshold HBV DNA level for HBeAg <span class=\"nowrap\">clearance/seroconversion</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. By contrast, most patients who develop HBeAg seroconversion during <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleos/tide</span> analogue therapy have undetectable serum HBV DNA (&lt;2 log(10) international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span>. In fact, many patients receiving <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleos/tide</span> analogue therapy remain HBeAg positive despite having undetectable serum HBV DNA for months or years. The explanation for this phenomenon is likely related to the lack of direct effect of <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleos/tide</span> analogues on covalently closed circular HBV DNA (ccc DNA) and viral RNA transcription and viral protein expression.</p><p>HBV DNA levels are also detectable in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, although levels are generally lower than in patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis. A serum HBV DNA level of &gt;2,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> has been proposed as a cutoff level to differentiate patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis from those in an inactive carrier state (ie, HBeAg-negative, persistently normal ALT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Two studies confirmed that serum HBV DNA levels of patients in the inactive carrier state were persistently below 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> but serum HBV DNA levels were highly variable among patients with HBeAg-negative hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40</a>]. Because of the fluctuations in HBV DNA levels in the latter patients, there is no absolute cutoff level that is reliable for differentiating patients in the inactive carrier state from those with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Some studies suggest that quantitative HBsAg levels &lt;1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> help in differentiating inactive carriers from those with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical role of serum HBV DNA assays in patients with chronic HBV infection is to assess HBV replication and candidacy for antiviral therapy. Indications for HBV treatment are based upon the presence of active liver disease and high HBV DNA levels. A cutoff of 20,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> has been proposed for treatment initiation in HBeAg positive patients, and a lower threshold 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> for HBeAg-negative patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Several large cohort studies reported that persistently high HBV DNA (&gt;4 log 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> or ~2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in patients who have been infected for more than four decades) are independently associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Data from these studies suggest that in patients who have been infected for several decades, high serum HBV DNA (on repeat tests) alone should be a consideration for initiating antiviral therapy.</p><p>Patients with high pretreatment serum HBV DNA levels are less likely to respond to interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. In contrast, pretreatment serum HBV DNA levels do not appear to predict response to <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleos/tide</span> analogue therapy. However, it may take longer for the HBV DNA to become undetectable in patients treated with <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleos/tide</span> analogue therapy if pretreatment levels are high. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-and-adefovir-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-hbv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tenofovir and adefovir for the treatment of chronic HBV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Suppression of serum HBV DNA is also used as one of the end-points in assessing response to antiviral treatment and to detect virologic breakthrough. With the availability of potent antiviral agents, suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels by PCR is the goal. Monitoring of serum HBV DNA using sensitive quantitative assays such as real time PCR assays with lower limit of detection of &lt;20 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> will identify patients who have suboptimal response that may benefit from additional therapy, and patients who have virologic breakthrough (&gt;1 log increase in HBV DNA from nadir while on treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].
