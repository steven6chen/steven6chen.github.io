Unlike some other vasculitides (eg, microscopic polyarteritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's]), polyarteritis nodosa is not associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The kidneys, skin, joints, muscles, nerves, and gastrointestinal tract are commonly involved, usually in some combination and sometimes all at once by the time of diagnosis. PAN can affect virtually any organ but has a striking tendency to spare the lungs. Clinical variants or subsets of PAN include single-organ disease and cutaneous-only PAN. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The spectrum of disease known as PAN has evolved and narrowed substantially due to the identification and classification of other forms of vasculitis that had previously been considered PAN. Most importantly, the establishment and acceptance of microscopic polyangiitis as a distinct disease, and the routine availability and recognition of ANCA testing as critical to diagnosing vasculitides other than PAN, have led to more patients with vasculitis being classified as not having PAN. Patient cohorts of PAN included in case series and other research studies published prior to the 1990s almost certainly included a mixture of the newer definition of PAN with microscopic polyangiitis and possibly other forms of vasculitis. Thus, case series of PAN published after this time period that specifically exclude patients with MPA provide important updated information about this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The annual incidence in three regions of Europe was estimated to be 4.4 to 9.7 per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The variation in estimates may be partly explained by differences in diagnostic criteria, but regional variations also appear to exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The marked reduction in hepatitis B virus infection in many parts of the world has been associated with a parallel reduction in prevalence of PAN.</p><p>The diagnosis is most commonly made in middle-aged or older adults, and the incidence rises with age, with a peak in the sixth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. There appears to be a 1.5:1 male predominance. Children can also be affected by PAN.

PAN in these settings is called secondary PAN and is also discussed elsewhere in topics related to the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease associated with hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of renal disease associated with hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Polyarteritis nodosa'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one report from France, HBV accounted for one-third of the cases of PAN, but even higher prevalence rates are possible in areas with endemic HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. HBV-related PAN has the same clinical features as non-HBV-related PAN and typically occurs within four months after the onset of HBV infection.</p><p>In some children with a form of vasculitis that has features similar to PAN, recessive loss of function mutations of the gene encoding adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2), a growth factor that is the major extracellular adenosine deaminase, has been shown to be associated with the vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Exome sequencing of genomic DNA was performed in 24 patients from multiply affected families of Georgian Jewish or German ancestry, or unrelated affected patients of Turkish ancestry, who had been diagnosed clinically with a PAN-like vasculitis. In almost all cases, the onset of disease was during childhood. ADA2 activity was significantly reduced in the serum specimens from the patients when compared with controls. This study, along with a related study also involving ADA2 and vasculopathy, provide data about genetic susceptibility and pathophysiology for at least a subset of patients with PAN-like disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

It seems likely that in terms of pathogenesis and pathophysiology, PAN represents a spectrum of disease rather than a single entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In some subsets of cases (eg, those associated with hepatitis B), immune complexes are thought to play a role. However, the mechanism(s) through which immune complex-mediated disease leads to medium-sized arterial inflammation and yet mostly spares arterioles, capillaries, and venules in PAN is unknown. In other subsets of this disease, immune complexes may play a less central role.</p><p>Thickening of the inflamed vessel wall and intimal proliferation can cause luminal narrowing, reducing blood flow and predisposing to thrombosis of affected vessels. The resulting ischemia or infarction of tissue causes varied clinical manifestations that are discussed in more detail below. As an example, involvement of branches of the renal arteries or intrarenal vessels such as the intralobular or arcuate arteries causes renal ischemia, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In addition to arterial narrowing and thrombosis, inflammation can cause weakening of the vessel wall that leads to aneurysm formation. Aneurysmal rupture may result in life-threatening bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the initiating event or underlying cause, established polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is characterized by segmental transmural inflammation of muscular arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast to some other forms of systemic vasculitis, PAN does not involve veins. The cellular infiltrate contains polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells. Fragments of white blood cells (leukocytoclasis) may be noted. Necrosis of the arterial wall results in a homogeneous, eosinophilic appearance referred to as fibrinoid necrosis. Disruption of the internal and external elastic lamina is noted and may contribute to the development of aneurysmal dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Lesions that appear to be of different ages are typically found within a single sample. Granulomatous inflammation does not occur in PAN, and its presence suggests other diagnoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) typically present with systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, weakness, fever, arthralgias) and signs (skin lesions, hypertension, renal insufficiency, neurologic dysfunction, abdominal pain) of multisystem involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53997\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53997 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin manifestations of PAN may include tender erythematous nodules, purpura, livedo reticularis, ulcers, and bullous or vesicular eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/4,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20,21</a>]. The nodules in PAN are reminiscent of erythema nodosum or nodular vasculitis, but adequate biopsy specimens demonstrate necrotizing vasculitis within the walls of medium-sized arteries, usually in the deep dermis or embedded between fat lobules in the subcutaneous fat, as well as small-sized arteries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis#H4122269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panniculitis: Recognition and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Inflammatory disorders'</a>.). </p><p>It is important to realize that dermatopathologists view arterial size as relative to those vessels seen in the skin; thus, &quot;medium-sized&quot; arteries in the skin may be smaller than other &quot;medium-sized&quot; arteries elsewhere, such as branches of the celiac axis or coronary arteries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The palpable purpuric lesions seen in PAN are identical to those seen in other forms of vasculitis usually associated with small vessel disease (eg, immunoglobulin A vasculitis [Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura], antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, and mixed cryoglobulinemia). Biopsy of these skin lesions reveals leukocytoclastic vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78697\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78697 \">picture 1</a>). Such findings illustrate that PAN does not exclusively involve medium-sized, muscular arteries but also includes small arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, presentations consistent with only small-vessel involvement essentially exclude PAN. </p><p>Skin lesions may be focal or diffuse and are more frequently and often more marked over the lower extremities. Limb edema is common. Progressive skin involvement may be severe, including infarction and gangrene of the fingers, toes, or other areas and ulceration extending into the subcutaneous tissue. However, digital and limb ischemia often reflects involvement of arteries larger than &quot;medium-sized&quot; skin vessels.</p><p>Many of the skin manifestations of PAN result from involvement of vessels within the subcutaneous tissues. For nodules and ulcers, small 2 to 4 mm &quot;punch&quot; biopsies of the skin that sample only the epidermis and superficial dermis are unlikely to include muscular arteries and thus are of limited value. Elliptical surgical skin biopsies that include deeper dermis and subcutaneous fat may be more helpful in diagnosis. As mentioned above, &quot;medium-sized&quot; arteries in the skin may actually be quite small compared with other medium-sized arteries (such as coronary or mesenteric arteries), but they are still muscular and are larger than the small, superficial precapillary arteries associated with purpura.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In autopsy studies, the kidneys are the most commonly involved organ. Renal involvement frequently leads to variable degrees of renal insufficiency and hypertension. In addition, rupture of renal arterial aneurysms can cause perirenal hematomas. Multiple renal infarctions may also develop in those with severe vasculitis.</p><p>Incomplete luminal narrowing of the inflamed arteries leads to glomerular ischemia but not inflammation or necrosis. Thus, the urinalysis, when abnormal, shows only sub-nephrotic and often minimal proteinuria and perhaps modest hematuria, but red blood cell casts (indicative of a glomerular focus of inflammation) are usually absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In patients with red blood cell casts, alternative diagnoses should be considered, including ANCA-associated vasculitis or systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><p>Hypertension is a common finding in patients with PAN and renal involvement. As noted above, renal ischemia, leading to activation of the renin-angiotensin system, is thought to be the primary mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mononeuropathy multiplex (or asymmetric polyneuropathy) affecting named nerves (eg, radial, ulnar, peroneal), typically with both motor and sensory deficits, is one of the most common findings in patients with PAN, occurring in up to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/4,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23-25</a>]. The neuropathy is generally asymmetric at onset, but additional nerve branches become affected over time, leading to a more confluent distal symmetric polyneuropathy. Involvement of the central nervous system occurs in 5 to 10 percent of patients with PAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/4,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is an early symptom in patients with mesenteric arteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The discomfort may be intermittent or continuous and may be most prominent after meals (&quot;intestinal angina&quot;). Weight loss may ensue due to decreased food intake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malabsorption. Progressive disease can result in bowel infarction with perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Other gastrointestinal symptoms that may be seen include nausea, vomiting, melena, bloody or nonbloody diarrhea, and life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Perforation during colonoscopy may be more frequent in patients with PAN. If colonoscopy is otherwise indicated in a patient with suspected or know PAN, minimal insufflation during the procedure is recommended; and if ischemic areas of bowel are noted, early termination of the study is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Ischemia due to vasculitis affects the small intestine more commonly than other areas of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, a subset of patients has predominantly mesenteric arterial involvement with little or no clinical evidence of extraintestinal vasculitis. Rare presentations resembling acute cholecystitis or appendicitis result from acute vasculitis limited to the cystic or appendiceal artery, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Segmental pancreatic infarction and necrotizing pancreatitis, albeit rare, may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary artery disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although overt myocardial infarction is uncommon, myocardial ischemia may result from narrowing or occlusion of the coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

However, because of the relative rarity of this disease and the potentially severe adverse effects related to treatment, the diagnosis should be confirmed by biopsy whenever possible. In the absence of an obvious site for biopsy, angiography sometimes reveals microaneurysms of blood vessels in the renal, hepatic, or mesenteric circulations.</p><p>A general approach to diagnosis in a patient suspected of having vasculitis is discussed in more detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>). The following is a brief summary with a focus on those features considered to be of particular importance in PAN.</p><p>Arteritis consistent with PAN can occur in individual organs without evident systemic involvement. Such cases may be discovered either through biopsy or angiography during an evaluation for vasculitis or &quot;incidentally&quot; upon pathologic review of a surgical specimen, sometimes obtained for other reasons. Whether to label such cases of medium-vessel vasculitis in a single organ as PAN is controversial.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High titers of ANA suggest an underlying autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), or an overlap syndrome, all of which may sometimes be associated with vasculitis. In patients with a positive ANA for whom there is clinical suspicion of a systemic rheumatic disease, additional serologic testing is indicated.

RF is also positive in mixed cryoglobulinemia, which is usually associated with HCV. Mixed cryoglobulinemia is suggested by the presence of cryoglobulins and complement consumption. Although cryoglobulinemia is typically associated with small vessel disease (eg, glomerulonephritis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, capillaritis), it has been linked to some cases of PAN, particularly in the setting of HCV or HBV infection.

Biopsy of clinically normal tissue has a much lower yield. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of patients with PAN, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), and other systemic vasculitides with gastrointestinal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Upper and lower gastrointestinal lesions, though frequently apparent at endoscopy, rarely provide histopathologic confirmation of vasculitis; none of the biopsies from the upper gastrointestinal tract obtained in 17 patients showed histologic signs of vasculitis. Colorectal biopsies, performed in six patients, were diagnostic in three (one with PAN and two with granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's]).</p><p>Renal biopsy in classic polyarteritis nodosa may reveal pathognomonic inflammation of the medium-sized arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74893\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74893 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Affected arteries may not be seen due to sampling error. However, the presence of small microaneurysms in the kidneys may increase the risk of bleeding from a renal biopsy; thus, some advocate performing a renal biopsy only in those patients in whom the arteriography is negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Arteriography and cross-sectional imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to biopsy for diagnosis is conventional mesenteric or renal arteriography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These studies will often be diagnostic, demonstrating multiple aneurysms and irregular constrictions in the larger vessels with occlusion of smaller penetrating arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65987\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65987 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Less invasive angiography techniques (eg, computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), can also be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In the proper clinical setting, the finding of wedge-shaped areas of ischemia in the kidney may be of value in demonstrating renal vascular involvement. The demonstration of renal infarctions, however, is less specific for PAN than are the microaneurysms demonstrated most readily by conventional arteriography. CT and MR angiography continue to improve with respect to resolution for vascular disease and utility to both establish the extent of disease in PAN and to allow for serial images to track disease course and treatment response. These techniques have the advantage of helping to avoid repeat catheter-based angiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is broad, including infectious diseases that affect the vasculature or are complicated by systemic vasculitis. Immunosuppressive therapies that might be appropriate for systemic vasculitis may mask the symptoms and delay the diagnosis of an infectious disease. Noninfectious disorders, particularly those that can cause widespread arterial embolism, thrombosis, or vasospasm, must be considered as these diseases are also not appropriately treated with immunosuppression. Other systemic vasculitides, although treated in a similar fashion to PAN, may have distinctive manifestations. The differential diagnosis of vasculitis is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The spectrum of disease known as PAN has evolved and narrowed substantially due to the identification and classification of other forms of vasculitis that had previously been considered PAN, particularly microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Unlike MPA, PAN is not associated with the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). The diagnosis is most commonly made in middle-aged or older adults, and the incidence rises with age, with a peak in the sixth decade of life. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of PAN are idiopathic, although hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, and hairy cell leukemia are important in the pathogenesis of some cases, which are termed secondary PAN. The pathogenetic mechanisms in PAN are poorly understood. It seems likely that, in terms of pathogenesis and pathophysiology, PAN represents a spectrum of disease rather than a single entity. Regardless of the underlying cause, established PAN is characterized by segmental transmural inflammation of muscular arteries; it does not involve veins, unlike other forms of systemic vasculitis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PAN typically present with systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, weakness, fever, arthralgias) and signs (skin lesions, hypertension, renal insufficiency, neurologic dysfunction, abdominal pain) of multisystem involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53997\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53997 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical diagnosis of PAN is suspected based upon the presence of characteristic symptoms, physical findings, and compatible laboratory test results. However, because of the relative rarity of this disease and because of the potentially severe adverse effects related to treatment, the diagnosis should be confirmed by biopsy whenever possible. In the absence of an obvious site for biopsy, angiography sometimes reveals microaneurysms of blood vessels in the renal, hepatic, or mesenteric circulations. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PAN is informed by the classification criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and by the definitions and nomenclature of the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference, but there are no validated diagnostic criteria for PAN.
