Similarly, several mechanisms contribute to the remarkable ability of normal gastroduodenal mucosa to defend itself against injury from the <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/peptic</span> activity in gastric juice and to rapidly repair injury when it does occur. Secretory, defense, and healing mechanisms are regulated by the same type of overlapping neural, endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine control pathways.</p><p>Gastric acid facilitates the digestion of protein and the absorption of iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and is necessary for the absorption of some drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, and thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Gastric acid, by lowering pH, kills ingested microorganisms and limits bacterial growth in the stomach and prevents intestinal infections such as Clostridium difficile. In addition, gastric acid may have a role in preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2529976150\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE STOMACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stomach consists of three anatomical (fundus, corpus, and antrum) and two functional areas (oxyntic and pyloric glands). The oxyntic area comprises approximately 80 percent of the stomach and contains parietal cells that produce gastric acid. Also present in the oxyntic glands are neuroendocrine cells producing paracrine and hormonal agents that modify parietal cell activity. The antrum of the stomach contains pyloric glands and their main feature is the presence of gastrin secreting G cells. Somatostatin secreting D cells are present in the pyloric and oxyntic glands and modulate gastrin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHASES OF ACID SECRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic stimulation of acid secretion has classically been divided into three interrelated phases: cephalic, gastric, and intestinal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>cephalic</strong> phase is activated by the thought, taste, smell, and sight of food, and swallowing. It is mediated mostly by <span class=\"nowrap\">cholinergic/vagal</span> mechanisms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>gastric</strong> phase is due to the chemical effects of food and distension of the stomach. Gastrin appears to be the major mediator since the response to food is largely inhibited by blocking gastrin action at its receptors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>intestinal</strong> phase accounts for only a small proportion of the acid secretory response to a meal; its mediators remain controversial. </p><p/><p>The observation that H2 receptor antagonists block the cephalic and gastric phases underscores the importance of histamine mediation of the stimulatory response, and illustrates the interdependence of the different phases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SECRETION OF ACID AND PEPSIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric acid secretion from parietal cells is regulated by redundant, overlapping pathways, which include endocrine (gastrin), paracrine (locally delivered histamine and somatostatin), neural (acetylcholine), and probably autocrine (transforming growth factor-alpha) factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65068 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">The parietal cell</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the resting state, parietal cells are filled with secretory vesicles that coalesce with stimulation to form channels (canaliculi) that drain to the apical lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The secretory membrane lining these structures contains the hydrogen-potassium-ATPase acid-secreting pump. This pump is always active, but exists in a short-circuited state in resting vesicles because the pathway necessary for transporting potassium to the apical surface for exchange with hydrogen is not present or active. With stimulation, this pathway for potassium-chloride cotransport becomes active, allowing hydrogen-potassium exchange to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>Parietal cell activation involves an increase in cytoplasmic calcium or generation of cyclic AMP, followed by activation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase cascade that triggers translocation of proton pump containing membranes to the apical surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The cessation of acid secretion is associated with the re-internalization of the hydrogen-potassium-ATPase pump. This process is mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of the beta subunit of the pump. Transgenic mice with a mutation at this site constitutively secrete acid and continuously express hydrogen-potassium-ATPase at the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrin is the major endocrine regulator of the secretory response to a protein meal. It is released from gastrin-expressing cells (G cells) localized to the antrum. Gastrin enhances gastric acid secretion from parietal cells primarily by stimulating the synthesis and release of histamine from oxyntic mucosal enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. However, gastrin also has direct actions on parietal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>Acid secretion is tightly controlled by a second hormone, somatostatin, which is a potent inhibitor of both gastrin and histamine synthesis and release, and, therefore, of gastric acid secretion. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Somatostatin'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gastrin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gastrin&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Gastrin is the best identified trophic regulator of parietal cell mass in humans. This relationship is evidenced by the presence of gastric hypertrophy in gastrinoma patients who have chronic exposure to elevated gastrin levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78549\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78549 \">picture 1</a>), and atrophy of the parietal cell mass with antrectomy, which decreases gastrin levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrin receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholecystokinin and gastrin have an identical pentapeptide terminal sequence. Gastrin acts via activation of the cholecystokinin CCK2 receptor (formerly known as the CCK-B or gastrin receptor), which has equal affinity for cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These receptors have been localized to parietal and ECL cells, but it is likely that the ECL cell gastrin receptor is of greater importance in regulating acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Mutant mice lacking CCK2 receptors have a reduction in gastric acid secretion that is primarily due to a reduced number of parietal and ECL cells and decreased expression of the histamine-forming enzyme histidine decarboxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Similar changes are seen in gastrin-deficient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>Gastrin &quot;receptors&quot; have also been found on somatostatin-secreting D cells. However, this receptor is a CCK1 that has much greater affinity for CCK than for gastrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This difference in receptor affinity may explain why gastrin is so much more effective as a stimulant of acid secretion, while CCK induces greater release of the inhibitor somatostatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Knockout mice that have been genetically engineered to be deficient in CCK2 receptors have low acid secretion, while double knockout mice (deficient in both gastrin and CCK receptors) have robust acid secretion in response to vagal stimulation or exogenous histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that CCK1 receptors exert inhibitory effects on acid secretion in vivo, mediated by release of endogenous somatostatin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gastrin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gastrin&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The localization of the receptors responsible for trophic actions of gastrin remains uncertain; the primary receptor appears to be on the ECL-like cell, although receptors may also be present on gastric stem cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Regulation of gastrin secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main stimulants of acid secretion are histamine released from the enterochromaffin cells (paracrine secretion), gastrin released from G cells (hormonal), and acetyl choline released from postganglionic enteric neurons. The principal inhibitor of acid secretion is somatostatin, which is released from oxyntic glands and antral D cells (paracrine). Physiologic factors enhancing secretion are vagal activation, food (particularly amino acids), and gastric distention. In contrast, carbohydrates and fat inhibit acid secretion. Intestinal exposure is required for the carbohydrate effect, but the mechanisms are uncertain. Fat stimulates the release of CCK, which is a potent inhibitor of acid secretion; fat also releases other potential mediators and it activates neural responses. </p><p>Complex mechanisms control gastrin release from the antral G cells. </p><p>Two meal-related factors stimulate gastrin secretion: gastric distention and amino acids.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effect of gastric distention varies with the degree of distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Low grade distention activates vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons, which stimulates somatostatin release and therefore inhibits gastrin secretion. Higher grade distention causes cholinergic activation, which reverses the pattern to one of increased gastrin and reduced somatostatin secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amino acids induce gastrin release; direct actions on the G cell have been demonstrated but amino acids also activate both cholinergic neurons and bombesin neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The release of bombesin (also called gastrin-releasing peptide) from mucosal nerves directly stimulates the G cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrin itself contributes to this process by enhancing the secretion of somatostatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholinergic activation after gastric distention or in response to a meal promotes acid secretion by shifting the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory mechanisms toward the stimulatory side, directly activating the parietal cell and stimulating gastrin release while suppressing somatostatin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/1,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Histamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histamine is the major paracrine stimulator of acid secretion. It is localized both in mucosal mast cells and in endocrine cells, the latter called ECL cells because of the silver-staining properties of their granules. The ECL cells are localized to the acid-secreting oxyntic or body mucosa, in direct proximity to the parietal cell.</p><p>Gastrin is the primary stimulus to histamine release from ECL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/15,18,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,34</a>]. ECL cells are also directly stimulated by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/24,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,35</a>]. Somatostatin is a major direct inhibitor of histamine release; calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), peptide YY, prostaglandins, and galanin also inhibit release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Stimulated ECL cells promptly degranulate, with release of histamine and pancreastatin from the vesicles; this is followed by an increase in histamine synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although gastric mast cells outnumber ECL cells, gastrin has only been demonstrated to release histamine from ECL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that ECL cell histamine is the major physiological mediator of acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/18,24,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24,37,38</a>]. Inhibitors of the histamine-forming enzyme histidine decarboxylase (HDC) block the acid secretory response to gastrin, but not to histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Furthermore, both H2 receptor deficient mice and HDC-knockout mice have near normal basal acid secretion, a preserved acid secretory response to cholinergic agents, an absent acid secretory response to exogenous gastrin, and hypergastrinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Mast cells may deliver histamine to parietal cells following exposure to certain antigens (or in patients with systemic mastocytosis), but there is no evidence that they have a role in the normal physiology of acid secretion.</p><p>The effects of histamine are largely mediated by the H2 receptors, which explain the efficacy of H2 receptor blockers in the treatment of acid-peptic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;</a>.) These drugs inhibit acid secretion in response to gastrin, meal, and neural stimulation, clearly establishing that histamine plays a role as a universal mediator or modulator of the acid secretory response. Histamine may also act at H3 receptors to increase acid secretion via inhibition of somatostatin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4263317042\"><span class=\"h2\">Ghrelin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide present mainly in the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach. Ghrelin increases food intake and has been reported to stimulate acid secretion via release of histamine from ECL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatostatin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. It is released from D cells, which are present throughout the gastric mucosa. Although somatostatin has some effects on parietal cells, its major effects are exerted on the inhibition of histamine release and to a lesser extent on gastrin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The secretion of somatostatin is increased by gastric acid and by gastrin itself, suggesting that a major function of somatostatin is to modulate the feedback inhibition of the acid secretory response to gastrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that mice lacking the somatostatin receptor have a tenfold increase in basal acid output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This effect can be abolished by gastrin antibody, suggesting that somatostatin suppresses gastric acid secretion via inhibition of the action of gastrin. There may be some effect on gastrin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], but it is likely that somatostatin primarily acts by suppressing gastrin-stimulated release of histamine from ECL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Somatostatin secretion is also affected by neural inputs. It is suppressed by cholinergic activation and increased by vasoactive intestinal peptide activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neural control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neural input may serve as an important integrator of secretory function. The mucosal nerves, containing acetylcholine, bombesin, VIP, and PACAP mediate the response to the cephalic phase of acid secretion and to gastric distention and amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Acetylcholine is the major stimulatory mediator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The major effects of muscarinic receptor activation are to increase gastrin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], stimulate parietal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and inhibit somatostatin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Bombesin release also stimulates acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], an effect that is mediated at least in part by enhanced gastrin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p>Muscarinic receptors on the parietal cells are of the M3 type and these receptors can be stimulated by fermented alcoholic beverages resulting in increased acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Vasoactive intestinal peptide release has a dual effect: a weak transient increase in acid secretion, possibly due to direct effects on ECL cells; and a sustained reduction due to enhanced release of somatostatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/42,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,46</a>].</p><p>Orexin, nitric oxide, and galanin may also contribute to the neural regulation of acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostaglandins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostaglandins are autocrine factors that inhibit acid secretion, histamine-stimulated parietal cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and gastrin-stimulated histamine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

Peptide YY (PYY) is released postprandially from cells in the ileum and colon and inhibits the cephalic and gastric phases of acid secretion via central and peripheral effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

The potentiating effect of pepsin may be due in part to its mucolytic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Peptic activity is closely linked to acid secretion and gastric pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

In addition, pepsinogen is converted to the active protease pepsin at low gastric pH; on the other hand, pepsin is inactivated when the pH is increased above 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

In addition, agents that raise cyclic AMP, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> and vasoactive intestinal peptide, increase pepsinogen secretion in vitro.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURING ACID SECRETION IN HUMANS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspiration of gastric contents via a nasogastric tube is the easiest method of measuring acid secretion, if collections are complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Basal acid secretion can also be reliably measured through an endoscope during a 15-minute collection period. Alternatively, intragastric titration allows the actual level of acid secretion to be measured by the quantity of base required to hold the gastric pH at a predetermined level. Placement of a gastric pH probe allows hydrogen ion concentration to be measured over a 24-hour period, but measuring hydrogen ion concentration provides only an indirect indicator of the rate of acid secretion.</p><p>Basal acid output (BAO) is the level of acid secretion when the subject is unstimulated; measurements are widely variable among individuals. Values in normal subjects are less than 10 mEq per hour, with an average of about 2 mEq per hour. </p><p>Maximal acid output is usually measured in response to pentagastrin and averages about 30 mEq per hour. The upper limits of the normal range (95 percent confidence level) is about 60 mEq per hour, underlining the point that acid secretion between duodenal ulcer and normal overlaps considerably.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Tolerance and acid rebound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two interesting and possibly related aspects of antisecretory therapy have come to light: tolerance to the administration of H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) and acid rebound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/18,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,59</a>].</p><p>Tolerance to H2RA develops after as few as seven days of therapy, with diminished effectiveness against nocturnal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. In one study, for example, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> reduced pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion by 95 percent prior to oral therapy, compared with only 62 percent inhibition after nine months of oral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>The clinical relevance of tolerance has not been established. It may contribute to the poor clinical response to H2RA in some patients with ulcer disease. Tolerance does not occur with proton pump inhibitors, probably because they block the final stage of acid secretion, the hydrogen-potassium-ATPase pump.</p><p>Rebound acid hypersecretion occurs after the cessation of one to nine months of H2RA therapy. Increases have been noted in nocturnal acid secretion and in the acid secretory response to a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. In one study, for example, cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> after 25 days of therapy was associated with a significant increase in intragastric acidity (17 percent at day three and 14 percent at day six) compared with pretreatment values; rebound was no longer present after day nine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The magnitude of the rebound appears to reflect the degree and duration of secretory inhibition.</p><p>Although initially controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], larger studies have also found rebound following treatment with proton pump inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. Rebound appears to be more common in patients not infected with <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (mean 82 percent increase in basal acid output and 28 percent increase in maximal acid output at day 15 after cessation, compared with pretreatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>A double blind, placebo-controlled study with healthy volunteers found that approximately 40 percent of subjects treated with eight weeks of PPI had heartburn or dyspepsia in the four weeks after PPI treatment was stopped, compared with 15 percent in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The study did not directly relate symptoms to rebound acid hypersecretion, but it suggests that rebound after stopping PPI treatment can provoke symptoms. A meta-analysis showed that rebound results in symptoms in healthy volunteers treated short term with PPIs but in patients who have been treated chronically with proton pump inhibitors, the clinical significance of rebound is less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of rebound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several potential mechanisms of rebound and tolerance, although their relative importance is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophy and hyperfunction of histamine-ECL cells presumably in response to relative hypergastrinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/18,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,65,66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophy and hyperfunction of parietal cells presumably in response to hypergastrinemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upregulation of histamine-independent stimulatory mechanisms mediated by <span class=\"nowrap\">vagal/cholinergic</span> pathways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Down-regulation of inhibitory pathways, such as those mediated by endogenous somatostatin.</p><p/><p>The observation that antisecretory therapy raises serum gastrin in proportion to the magnitude of acid inhibition led to the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia was the primary factor underlying rebound acid hypersecretion. However, rebound appears to occur on nighttime maintenance doses of H2RA, which cause only minimal nocturnal and no daytime hypergastrinemia. Furthermore, although sustained, prominent hypergastrinemia causes acid hypersecretion, the threshold duration and magnitude of hypergastrinemia required for a hypersecretory response remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

This observation is consistent the hypothesis that muscarinic pathways play a role in H2RA-refractory secretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of Helicobacter pylori infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute infection with <em>H. pylori</em> causes a transient hypochlorhydria that may help the organism colonize the stomach. Chronic infection with <em>H. pylori</em> can be associated with increased or decreased acid secretion, depending on the severity of the gastritis and the anatomic distribution of gastritis. Chronic pangastritis is associated with reduced acid production, which initially is caused by a functional inhibition of parietal cells by inflammatory cytokines and products of H pylori. Over time, chronic <em>H. pylori</em> infection can cause gastric atrophy and irreversible hypochlorhydria and eventually achlorhydria. This pattern of gastritis is seen in approximately 85 percent of patients. A smaller proportion of patients (15 percent) have a pattern of gastritis that involves primarily the antrum (antrum-predominant). This pattern of gastritis is associated with decreased somatostatin levels, high gastrin levels, and increased acid production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTRIC ACID HYPERSECRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric acid hypersecretion (characterized by a basal acid output &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/hour)</span> is observed in approximately 30 percent of patients with duodenal ulcers. <em>H. pylori</em> infection is a contributing factor, but some patients have acid hypersecretion independent of <em>H. pylori</em>.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Phases of acid secretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric acid secretion from parietal cells is regulated by endocrine (gastrin), paracrine (locally delivered histamine and somatostatin), neural (acetylcholine), and autocrine (transforming growth factor-alpha) factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65068 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Secretion of acid and pepsin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrin is the major endocrine regulator of the secretory response to a protein meal. Gastrin enhances gastric acid secretion from parietal cells largely via the release of histamine from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. Gastrin also exerts trophic action on the gastric mucosa by direct effects on histamine-secreting ECL cells and possibly by effects on gastric stem cells and parietal cells. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Gastrin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Histamine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatostatin, released from D cells in the gastric mucosa, is a potent inhibitor of acid secretion. Although somatostatin has some effects on parietal cells, its major effects are exerted on the inhibition of histamine release and to a lesser extent on gastrin release. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Somatostatin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mucosal nerves, containing acetylcholine, bombesin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), mediate the response to the cephalic phase of acid secretion and to gastric distention and amino acids. Acetylcholine is the major stimulatory mediator that increases gastrin release, stimulates parietal cells, and inhibits somatostatin secretion. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Regulation of gastrin secretion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Neural control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostaglandins are autocrine factors that inhibit acid secretion, histamine-stimulated parietal cell function, and gastrin-stimulated histamine release. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Prostaglandins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tolerance to H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) develops after as few as seven days of therapy, with diminished effectiveness against nocturnal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. Tolerance does not occur with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), probably because they block the final stage of acid secretion, the hydrogen-potassium-ATPase pump.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rebound acid hypersecretion occurs after the cessation of one or more months of H2RA or PPI therapy. Therefore, long-term antisecretory therapy should probably not be abruptly discontinued in patients at risk for complications or recurrence.
