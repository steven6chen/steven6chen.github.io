The patient should be evaluated for the ability to tolerate surgery and adjuvant therapy. A complete history and physical examination and appropriate laboratory testing are performed. Pretreatment evaluation and staging of vulvar cancer are discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H3468603024\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>However, for some patients, surgery and adjuvant treatment are not feasible. For example, for some patients with locally advanced disease, removal of the primary tumor and lymph nodes may not be possible if nodes are fixed to the femoral vessels or other pelvic organs. Additionally, medically frail patients may not be able to tolerate surgery and adjuvant treatment. Finally, those with distant metastatic disease should be treated with medical treatment only.

We base our decisions for adjuvant therapy on the results of surgical staging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: Staging and surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Staging and surgical treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3924119475\"><span class=\"h2\">Node-negative disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with early-stage disease require adjuvant therapy. However, data are limited in regards to which patients with early-stage (I or II) vulvar cancer are most likely to benefit. Our approach to the patient with resected vulvar cancer that is node negative based on the results of lymphadenectomy is to administer adjuvant radiation therapy (RT, to the primary only) for tumors that are &gt;4 cm or have positive or close margins (&le;8 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], consistent with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some experts alternatively opt for re-excision or close surveillance in women with close margins instead of vulvar radiation in order to avoid the toxicities of vulvar radiation.

The choice between adjuvant RT and chemoradiation depends on the risk features of the disease and health status of the patient. In general, our approach is to utilize adjuvant RT alone in patients with one nodal micrometastasis and chemoradiation for those with any macroscopic nodal disease or with micrometastatic nodal disease involving two lymph nodes. </p><p>Adjuvant treatment appeared beneficial in a multi-institutional retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among those with pathologically involved groin nodes (n = 447), 244 patients received adjuvant therapy consisting mainly of adjuvant RT (84 percent) and adjuvant chemoradiation (14 percent). Compared with those who did not undergo postoperative therapy, adjuvant treatment significantly improved the three-year rate for progression-free survival (40 versus 26 percent, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.88). However, there was no significant improvement in the rate of overall survival at three years (57 versus 51 percent).</p><p>The GROningen INternational Study on Sentinel nodes in Vulvar cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(GROINS-V-II)/Gynecologic</span> Oncology group (GOG) 270 protocol is investigating the safety of complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy versus adjuvant radiotherapy in early-stage vulvar cancer patients with a sentinel node metastasis &le;2 mm as well as the efficacy, safety, and short- and long-term morbidity of inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy in patients with a sentinel node metastasis &gt;2 mm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2493894246\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemoradiation versus RT alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon limited data, our preferred approach is to utilize weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> concurrently with radiation in such patients. However, in the absence of randomized data suggesting a preferred adjuvant modality, adjuvant radiation without chemotherapy is also an acceptable option. For patients who progress after first-line chemotherapy, treatment options mirror those for women with metastatic cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-cervical-cancer#H85099849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Second-line therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The benefit of chemoradiation over RT alone was suggested in a study that utilized the United States National Cancer Database (NCDB) and included over 1700 women with node-positive, resected vulvar cancer (77 percent with up to three nodes involved) who subsequently were treated with adjuvant therapy (RT only or RT and chemotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. On multivariate analysis, the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a trend towards a reduction in the risk of death compared with adjuvant RT alone (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-1.01). Most patients receiving chemotherapy in this study initiated it within one week of initiating radiotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2586634519\"><span class=\"h3\">Extent of radiation treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with involvement of the lymph nodes, treatment should encompass the inguinal, external iliac, internal iliac, and obturator regions bilaterally. Adjuvant groin RT is not indicated for patients without pathologic evidence of groin node involvement. For patients with involved nodes who have undergone excision of the primary vulvar lesion to negative surgical margins, some UpToDate experts limit RT to the pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally without treatment to the vulva, which can help to minimize morbidity. Other UpToDate experts generally include the vulva in order to reduce the risk of recurrence, particularly when other risk factors such as close margins, extensive lymphovascular invasion, or satellite, in-transit lesions are present. The rationale for inclusion of the vulva is that radiation to treat a vulvar recurrence, should it occur, can be difficult if groin irradiation has been previously delivered, given the difficulty in matching prior radiation fields. Technique of RT delivery is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3803941167\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below.)</p><p>The evidence to support bilateral pelvic and inguinal RT for patients with confirmed nodal involvement comes from a GOG study that compared adjuvant nodal RT (to the inguinal and pelvic nodal regions) with pelvic lymphadenectomy in women with pathologic node involvement confirmed after bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This study was stopped early because adjuvant RT resulted in improved two-year survival compared with pelvic lymphadenectomy, particularly among patients with clinically identified node involvement (59 versus 31 percent) and those with two or more positive inguinal nodes (63 versus 37 percent). A long-term update of this clinical trial confirmed these data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>While observational data suggest that RT can be efficacious when limited to the unilateral involved side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], we prefer to treat women with pathologically confirmed nodal involvement with bilateral inguinal and pelvic RT until unilateral RT is evaluated in a properly designed prospective trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3803941167\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with vulvar cancer in whom adjuvant RT is recommended, RT has been traditionally administered in the supine, frog-legged position using opposed <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior</span> (AP-PA) beams with a supplement dose to the vulva or inguinal nodes as needed, with the total dose between 45 and 50.4 Gy. A thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) should be placed externally over the vulvar surface and internally within the vulva for the initial fractions to ensure that the dose received matches the treatment plan, as surface dosing can be challenging with the use of megavoltage photons.</p><p>Various techniques for encompassing the regional lymph nodes are used, including a modified AP-PA method. The AP field includes the inguinofemoral lymph node chains with careful attention to the three-dimensional soft tissue anatomy. In order to encompass this area, the treatment field is usually expanded laterally while the PA field is kept narrower, just medial to the femoral necks and heads. Electrons, which penetrate tissue only superficially, are used to supplement the dose to the inguinal nodes and spare the femur from unnecessary radiation.</p><p>The use of intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) may be particularly advantageous in this situation, as it may reduce dose to the femoral head and neck, small bowel, rectum, and bladder. In patients receiving chemoradiotherapy, IMRT may also be used to reduce dose to the pelvic bone marrow, which may help reduce the risk of hematologic toxicity. Because dosimetric calculations for tissues at or immediately below the skin are difficult using IMRT, the delivered dose should be confirmed by TLDs when this technology is employed. Consensus guidelines have been published describing the use of IMRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3281130383\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE THAT CANNOT BE MANAGED SURGICALLY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2761933274\"><span class=\"h2\">Unresectable, locally advanced disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resection of the primary tumor and inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy may not be possible when nodes are fixed to the femoral vessels or other vital structures.

Chemoradiation commonly employs total radiation doses that are 10 to 20 percent less than primary RT, and may therefore result in lesser local toxicity. The bilateral inguinofemoral lymph nodes may be included within the treatment target volume for these patients, although prospective data to inform the benefits and risks of doing so are sparse. However, when appropriate radiation techniques are applied and synchronous chemotherapy administered, groin relapses are very rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Of 40 patients who completed chemoradiation, 37 had a complete clinical response. Among these women, 34 underwent surgical biopsy, of whom 29 had a complete pathologic response (78 percent). </p><p/><p>Despite the lack of high-quality data in vulvar cancer, we feel chemoradiation is an appropriate option in selected patients with locally advanced vulvar cancer based on our experience with chemoradiation in cervical cancer and cancers of the anal canal. Chemoradiation compared with radiation alone has led to decreased recurrence rates of anal cancer and has been associated with a survival benefit in cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, staging, and treatment of anal cancer&quot;, section on 'Combined modality therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locally advanced cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Primary chemoradiation'</a>.)</p><p>There are no prospective trials comparing RT alone to chemoradiation in the treatment of vulvar cancer. However, indirect evidence suggests that chemoradiation may be equivalent to surgery in patients with resectable disease, therefore providing a rationale for its use in patients for whom surgery is not an option. A 2011 systematic review of three studies (one randomized) compared primary surgery with chemoradiation in women with locally advanced, primary squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Compared with primary surgery, the use of chemoradiation alone resulted in no difference in overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09, 95% CI 0.37-3.17); however, the wide confidence intervals suggest there are insufficient data to make a definitive conclusion, and all three studies were determined to be at moderate or high risk of bias. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387615763\"><span class=\"h3\">Management after primary treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following primary treatment for unresected, non-metastatic disease, further management is based on the response to treatment, which is usually assessed by clinical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy 6 to 12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients treated with initial chemoradiation for locoregional disease deemed to be unresectable at initial presentation may experience a complete response.
