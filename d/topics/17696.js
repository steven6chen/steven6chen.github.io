The resulting imbalance in the ratio of alpha to beta globin chains leads to precipitation of the unpaired chains, which in turn causes destruction of developing red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow that can lead to ineffective erythropoiesis, anemia, and iron overload. The classical thalassemia phenotypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115337 \">table 1</a>), genetic defects, and pathophysiology are discussed in detail separately.

These findings can occur even with the best feasible transfusion support, although they can often be mitigated with therapy, usually requiring subspecialty consultation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha or beta thalassemia major</strong> &ndash; Individuals with thalassemia major typically require chronic hypertransfusion to treat severe, symptomatic anemia. Iron overload is inevitable; monitoring iron stores and use of iron chelation are integral components of therapy (see <a href=\"#H3086565743\" class=\"local\">'Management of anemia'</a> below). Consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or enrollment in a clinical trial testing other disease-modifying therapies may be appropriate for selected individuals with severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H3879790468\" class=\"local\">'Decision to pursue allogeneic HCT'</a> below and <a href=\"#H61767539\" class=\"local\">'Investigational disease-modifying approaches'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thalassemia intermedia phenotypes</strong> &ndash; Individuals with thalassemia intermedia phenotypes may be transfusion-independent; they may require intermittent transfusions during periods of erythropoietic stress such as infection or pregnancy; or they may become transfusion-dependent, similar to individuals with thalassemia major. (See <a href=\"#H3086565743\" class=\"local\">'Management of anemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H223351777\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha or beta thalassemia minor (or trait)</strong> &ndash; Individuals with thalassemia minor, thalassemia trait, or thalassemia minima typically do not require any interventions for anemia or other deviations from routine medical care. However, it is important for these individuals to be aware of their diagnosis so that they do not undergo unnecessary testing or empiric treatment with iron for an incorrect diagnosis of iron deficiency, as well as for prenatal planning for potential pregnancies.</p><p/><p>Other aspects of care that apply to all individuals, regardless of disease severity, include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anemia</strong> &ndash; We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation if there is evidence of ongoing hemolysis (eg, 1 to 2 mg daily), and we avoid iron supplementation unless there is concomitant iron deficiency.

Hypertransfusion refers to chronic transfusions in which the hemoglobin level is not allowed to drop below a certain level; this suppresses extramedullary hematopoiesis and reduces symptoms of anemia.</p><p>Our approach according to disease severity and age of presentation is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113996\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113996 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For cases of alpha thalassemia major with severe fetal anemia, intrauterine transfusion may be possible, followed by chronic transfusions after birth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine fetal transfusion of red cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with beta thalassemia major, we recommend chronic transfusion, initiated in early childhood as soon as the disease manifestations (eg, severe anemia) become present. (See <a href=\"#H235980892\" class=\"local\">'Typical hypertransfusion regimen'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with thalassemia intermedia who have anemia that is severe enough to require transfusion, decisions must be made regarding whether to initiate a chronic hypertransfusion regimen in order to suppress ineffective erythropoiesis or to provide periodic transfusions for symptomatic relief <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> during periods of increased stress. (See <a href=\"#H455839550\" class=\"local\">'Decision to initiate regular transfusions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with thalassemia minor or minima, transfusions are not required; anemia is very mild or absent. Development of anemia should prompt evaluation for a cause other than thalassemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with anemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Individuals with thalassemia can develop anemia due to other causes that should be addressed and treated in order to reduce the transfusional iron burden. Examples include hemolysis related to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which has a similar geographic distribution as thalassemia; folate deficiency due to increased requirement caused by chronic hemolysis; aplastic crisis due to parvovirus B19 infection; hemolytic crisis; or hypersplenism due to extramedullary hematopoiesis. Evaluation for these other causes of anemia depends on the patient history and presenting findings, as discussed below and in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with anemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some cases of severe disease, it may be appropriate to pursue other interventions for anemia such as splenectomy, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), or other therapies discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3208510339\" class=\"local\">'Role of splenectomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3879790468\" class=\"local\">'Decision to pursue allogeneic HCT'</a> below and <a href=\"#H61767539\" class=\"local\">'Investigational disease-modifying approaches'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3670279773\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamins and supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation for all individuals with thalassemia major and for any individual with thalassemia intermedia who has evidence of chronic hemolysis. The typical dose is 1 to 2 mg per day. The purpose is to compensate for increased folate requirements associated with increased red blood cell (RBC) turnover. It may be reasonable to omit folic acid supplements if this is especially burdensome to the patient or family <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if there is no clinical evidence of folate deficiency.</p><p>It is prudent for individuals with thalassemia to avoid taking iron-containing supplements (eg, vitamins plus iron) unless they have documented iron deficiency given that thalassemia can be associated with increased iron absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. We do not tell patients to avoid red meat entirely, but we do advise them to be judicious about overall intake of iron-rich foods. We also do not advise consumption of tea as a way to decrease iron absorption, but when appropriate we do share the information that tea may reduce iron absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite the general recommendations to avoid excess iron, iron replacement therapy should not be withheld from those with true iron deficiency anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We generally do not use zinc supplements unless the individual has documented zinc deficiency or has symptoms suggestive of zinc deficiency such as impaired taste or smell. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zinc deficiency and supplementation in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455839550\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision to initiate regular transfusions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thalassemia major</strong> &ndash; Individuals with thalassemia major are transfusion-dependent. For these individuals, we suggest hypertransfusion rather than a more restrictive strategy. In the context of thalassemia, hypertransfusion refers to regularly administered transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level that typically does not fall below a certain value. For most of these individuals, we suggest a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of approximately 9.5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. The number of units transfused depends on the individual's body size and baseline hemoglobin level. In adults, it is usually not practical to give more than two units of packed RBCs at a time, so the interval between transfusions is adjusted to maintain the hemoglobin level in the appropriate range. The timing of initiation is typically when the individual becomes symptomatic transfusion-dependent in early infancy; the indication to initiate therapy in these children is invariably straightforward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most individuals with alpha thalassemia major have hydrops fetalis and do not survive in utero, although cases have been published describing exchange transfusion in utero <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thalassemia intermedia</strong> &ndash; Thalassemia intermedia phenotypes encompass a range of clinical phenotypes. Transfusions are given as needed; often, this is during periods of erythropoietic stress such as acute infectious illnesses, periods of rapid growth, surgery, or pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia will eventually become transfusion-dependent and require hypertransfusion therapy, but this may not be needed until adulthood (eg, third to fourth decade of life) and does not always occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Deciding to initiate regular transfusions in such cases is significantly more challenging, and we individualize this decision based on the patient's age and specific disease complications, balanced with the burdens of a hypertransfusion program including increased iron stores. The decision takes into account the patient's activity limitations, growth, development, and the early appearance of skeletal changes or other disease-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. We generally initiate transfusions if the patient has signs of cardiopulmonary compromise, functional deterioration, or signs and symptoms of significant extramedullary hematopoiesis such as expanding bony masses, pathologic fractures, or hypersplenism. Symptoms usually develop when the hemoglobin level falls below 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> although there is no specific hemoglobin level that can be used to guide the decision. Assessment by a clinician with expertise in treating hemoglobinopathies is prudent. Once the decision to initiate hypertransfusion is made, the patient is treated similar to those with beta thalassemia major.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many individuals with alpha thalassemia intermedia phenotypes who have hemoglobin levels above 8 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> will be able to avoid chronic transfusions, and these individuals may do well with only intermittent transfusions when needed, such as in the setting of infection or pregnancy. Individuals with hemoglobin H disease are at increased risk of oxidative stress to RBCs and may require closer monitoring and possibly transfusion during infections or upon exposure to oxidant drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235980892\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical hypertransfusion regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical hypertransfusion regimen is designed to maintain a relatively stable hemoglobin level that is adequate to maintain good cardiovascular status and exercise tolerance and to at least partially suppress ineffective erythropoiesis.</p><p>For most individuals treated with hypertransfusion to reduce complications of ineffective or extramedullary hematopoiesis, we suggest using a regimen that results in a pretransfusion hemoglobin level in the range of 9.5 to 10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> rather than higher or lower levels. This approach is directed at achieving the optimal balance between suppressing hematopoiesis and minimizing iron overload. A higher level may be used for individuals with heart disease, clinically significant extramedullary hematopoiesis, inadequately suppressed bone marrow, or back pain prior to transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A lower level (such as 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> may be used if the primary goal of transfusion is to treat anemia rather than to suppress ineffective erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Evidence to support the benefits of hypertransfusion and the appropriate nadir hemoglobin level comes from observational studies in which individuals with beta thalassemia have been transfused using various hemoglobin or hematocrit values. No data are available from randomized trials comparing clinical outcomes with different hemoglobin levels.</p><p>The following studies illustrate the association between transfusion using a higher baseline hemoglobin level and reduced complications of extramedullary hematopoiesis or iron turnover:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1964 cross-sectional survey compared outcomes in 35 children under 12 years of age with beta thalassemia who were chronically transfused to low, intermediate, or high hemoglobin levels (pretransfusion hemoglobin levels of 4 to 5.9, 6 to 7.9, or 8 to 9.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Despite having relatively similar baseline ages and hematologic characteristics, these children demonstrated strong correlations between higher hemoglobin levels and improved clinical outcomes, including greater height, smaller liver and spleen size (for those who had not undergone splenectomy), less frontal skull thickening and maxillary overgrowth, less periodontal and dental disease, and fewer bone fractures, all potential indicators of reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1980 study evaluated the effect of using transfusion to maintain two different target hematocrits, 27 versus 35 percent (approximate hemoglobin of 9 versus 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> respectively) in 10 individuals with beta thalassemia who were postsplenectomy and served as their own controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Compared with the lower target, the higher target was associated with a slower plasma iron clearance (mean half-life of transferrin-bound iron measured using radiolabeled iron, from 24 to 108 minutes) and a slower plasma iron turnover (from approximately 10 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL/day)</span>. Another report from 1980 selected a target hemoglobin of 11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> based on expert consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1997 study involving a cohort of 32 individuals with beta thalassemia receiving regular transfusions found that lowering pretransfusion hemoglobin levels from approximately 11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to approximately 9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> reduced iron overload without adverse effects; the proportion entering normal puberty improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>These initial studies were followed by attempts to further define the ideal target hemoglobin level. As an example, a retrospective review evaluated 32 children with beta thalassemia who were transfused to maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (mean, 11.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and then were subsequently switched to a lower pretransfusion hemoglobin level of 9 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (mean, 9.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The switch correlated with a decreased number of transfusions (from approximately 137 to 104 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/year)</span> and a decreased ferritin level (from 2280 to 1004 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L);</span> the lower threshold did not appear to be associated with laboratory changes of increased erythroid activity or adverse effects on growth or endocrine function.</p><p>The initial number of units (or volume of blood) to transfuse depends on the starting hemoglobin level, the desired increase, the hematocrit of the packed RBCs, and the size of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F114028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114028 \">table 2</a>). Adjustments require some empirical dose-finding for each individual. Regardless of the dose and schedule, the post-transfusion hemoglobin level should not exceed 14 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> due to risks of hyperviscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>We generally avoid giving more than 10 mL per kg of packed RBCs in a single day; this is a dose that should yield a post-transfusion hemoglobin increase of about 3 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. If there is uncertainty about the appropriate number of units to give, administration of the equivalent of two units of packed RBCs every two to four weeks or one to three units of packed RBCs every three to five weeks is a good starting point. Some centers initially use a greater number of transfusions to raise the hemoglobin to 12 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Occasional reports of bizarre reactions occurring within the first 24 to 48 hours after transfusion have led to the recommendation that no more than 10 to 15 mL of RBCs per kg of body weight be administered during any 24-hour period, and we tend to favor the more conservative end of this range (ie, no more than 10 mL of RBCs per kg) except in cases of profound emergency.</p><p>Transfusions can be repeated daily or every two to three days until the pretransfusion hemoglobin is in the range of 9.5 to 10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. The post-transfusion hemoglobin should be approximately 12 to 13 and no higher than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. The timing and dose of RBC transfusions can then be titrated for the individual patient. Typically, a dose of 8 to 10 mL of RBCs per kg every two to three weeks will maintain the desired hemoglobin levels if great care is taken to use thoroughly washed and crossmatched RBC products.</p><p>For children undergoing hypertransfusion, an evaluation of the need for a central venous access catheter may be appropriate, especially if lifelong transfusional support is anticipated. Ideally, we try to defer this until after the rapid growth of infancy and toddlerhood has occurred in order to avoid the need for frequent revision of intravenous access devices.</p><p>As noted below, extended crossmatching to prevent alloimmunization, leukocyte depletion to reduce febrile nonhemolytic reactions, and other measures to reduce transfusion reactions are used.

Iron stores are monitored on a regular basis in these individuals. We typically use the serum ferritin level for serial testing. We obtain baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and use MRI-based estimates of liver or cardiac iron concentration for individuals with signs of organ injury if there is a significant increase in serum ferritin or if ferritin values are discordant with clinical expectations. Liver biopsy may be used, but this is less common with the availability of MRI.</p><p>Iron chelation is generally initiated in one or more of the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the same time that a hypertransfusion program is started</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the serum ferritin exceeds 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the liver or cardiac iron concentration exceeds 3 mg iron per g of dry weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After transfusion of approximately 20 to 25 units of RBCs</p><p/><p>For most children with beta thalassemia major, iron chelation is instituted before six years of age (often as early as two to four years). For those with alpha or beta thalassemia intermedia, the need for chelation depends on whether (or when) hypertransfusion is used and the parameters listed above; often, this is in the second or third decade of life.</p><p>MRI appears to be superior to measurement of serum ferritin for estimating total body iron burden in these patients, especially in individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia. This was illustrated in a 2008 study in which 74 individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia had both serum ferritin testing and liver MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Serum iron levels increased with age according to both modalities. However, serum ferritin correlated with liver iron only in those with thalassemia major and not in those with thalassemia intermedia. A proposed hypothesis for this difference was that individuals with thalassemia major were receiving more transfusions, leading to increased distribution to the reticuloendothelial system and increased ferritin, whereas for those with thalassemia intermedia, the main source of iron overload was increased intestinal absorption with deposition in the liver and less of an increase in serum ferritin. Smaller studies of individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia have appeared to corroborate this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Once initiated, the chelation program requires close monitoring and attention.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of alloimmunization in thalassemia has been estimated to be in the range of 10 to 50 percent. Lower rates in some populations may reflect a more homogenous genetic background (eg, 8 percent in Egypt, 6 percent in Eastern India) or the use of more extensive crossmatching protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>When blood is requested, the blood bank or transfusion medicine service should be made aware that the patient has thalassemia so that extra care can be taken to avoid possible alloimmunization. This may include matching for Rh antigens other than Rh(D), such as C and E, and Kell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Some reports have suggested that starting the transfusion program at a younger age may be associated with a lower rate of alloimmunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/33,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35,36</a>].

The risk of thromboembolic disease appears to be higher in individuals with thalassemia (especially beta thalassemia intermedia) following splenectomy (over an increased baseline risk due to thalassemia). In a retrospective cohort of 83 individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia followed for a decade, 24 (29 percent) had an episode of venous thromboembolism; all except one had undergone splenectomy for their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

However, transplant toxicities and transplant-related mortality are serious concerns, even for the best candidates (ie, young children with no comorbidities and a human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-identical sibling donor). Lack of a suitable donor or the lack of available resources to perform HCT are both major barriers that eliminate the HCT option for many individuals. A role for HCT in alpha thalassemia (eg, hemoglobin H disease) has not been established.</p><p>Despite these barriers, HCT may be appropriate for some individuals, such as children with beta thalassemia major who have been treated with hypertransfusion and chelation and have a suitable donor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113996\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113996 \">algorithm 1</a>). The decision whether, and when, to pursue HCT for a patient with thalassemia is highly complex and should be made only in consultation with a thalassemia specialist in conjunction with an experienced high-volume transplant center. The challenge is that the mortality and significant morbidities associated with HCT are lowest if the HCT is administered during the mid-first decade of life, prior to the development of significant iron overload <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other comorbidities such as hypersplenism; however, this is also the time when the long-term clinical prognosis with conventional therapy is often not yet clear. The decision will also be influenced by the availability of a well-matched donor. As a general guide, a child who is hypertransfusion-dependent, requires iron chelation, and has a matched donor should be evaluated with an initial consultation for HCT.</p><p>As investigational methods for performing HCT such as the use of partially matched donors and reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens evolve, the indications may broaden, especially for adolescents and young adults. Thus, any transfusion-dependent individual or individual with significant comorbidities such as growth retardation or bony deformities may be referred for a transplant evaluation.</p><p>Detailed information on best practices for HCT in thalassemia, as well as potential complications and post-HCT care, is presented separately.

This occurs because ineffective erythropoiesis promotes excessive iron absorption, which can be further exacerbated by chronic transfusions. Thus, assessment of iron stores and reduction of excess iron stores is an integral component of prevention and therapy for these complications. (See <a href=\"#H641704023\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of iron stores and initiation of chelation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The pace of developing complications related to iron overload depends on the severity of thalassemia and the frequency of transfusions. As an example, an individual with beta thalassemia major who receives chronic transfusions without chelation therapy may develop severe iron overload in childhood, whereas one with beta thalassemia intermedia who receives intermittent transfusions may not develop iron overload until adulthood. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155128171\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine evaluations and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with thalassemia major are typically cared for by a specialist and are seen at least two to four times a year to monitor progression of any of the major morbidities. Once the pace of any complication is established to be stable, follow-up for general care and monitoring can be done by either a specialist or the patient's primary clinician. Frequent contact with the patient is feasible because of the hypertransfusion schedule. Patients can be evaluated when onsite for transfusion. At follow-up visits for both thalassemia major, once the transfusion schedule is established, and for thalassemia intermedia, we monitor as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anemia</strong> &ndash; We measure the complete blood count (CBC) and reticulocyte count at each visit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iron stores</strong> &ndash; We measure the serum ferritin two to three times per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac status</strong> &ndash; We perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at initial evaluation and when there are significant changes in ferritin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver</strong> &ndash; We assess liver function tests and hepatitis serologies two to four times per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone health</strong> &ndash; We assess bone health if any evidence of growth retardation or bony abnormalities (eg, facial deformities) is apparent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endocrine status</strong> &ndash; We test thyroid function annually (more frequently if there are signs consistent with thyroid dysfunction).

Individuals with thalassemia trait can be followed by primary care providers with a hematologist or geneticist as backup for counseling or changes in blood counts. It is important to educate these patients about the tendency of providers to confuse thalassemia trait with iron deficiency and prescribe iron supplements, while at the same time noting that they are susceptible to all of the usual causes of iron deficiency.

Hydroxyurea promotes the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which can ameliorate the severity of beta thalassemia, and efforts persist to determine if hydroxyurea might be of benefit as part of a multidrug regimen.</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> in reducing transfusion requirements in thalassemia was evaluated in a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of studies (17 studies, mostly observational) involving 709 individuals with non-transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia who nevertheless required transfusions periodically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. For the individuals who required four or more transfusions per year, hydroxyurea use was associated with a 42 percent reduction in transfusion requirements (95% CI 29-56 percent) and a decrease in the transfusion requirement by half or more in 79 percent (95% CI 71-86 percent). Therapy was well tolerated, but there was no control arm, and follow-up was short (one to two years in most studies). A 2016 Cochrane review addressing the role of hydroxyurea in thalassemia identified one randomized trial comparing two doses of hydroxyurea (10 versus 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily), which found higher hemoglobin levels with the <strong>lower </strong>dose of hydroxyurea (mean difference, 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> 95% CI 2.0-2.8); the trial did not report the effects on transfusion requirements, and the meta-analysis concluded that high-quality data were lacking to show any benefit of hydroxyurea in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>The explanation for the reduced efficacy in thalassemia compared with SCD may be related to the differences in erythropoietic activity between the two disorders. In SCD, sickling and hemolysis occur predominantly in the peripheral circulation, where decreases in oxygen tension lead to hemoglobin polymerization. By contrast, thalassemias are characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, with failure of normal red blood cell (RBC) maturation and premature death of RBC precursors. This process is also called intramedullary hemolysis to distinguish it from hemolysis within the peripheral circulation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> appears to improve production of HbF-containing RBCs but does not ameliorate intramedullary hemolysis and apoptosis. In addition, hydroxyurea is myelosuppressive, which may exacerbate the anemia in thalassemia to a greater degree than in SCD. It is also possible that the benefit of hydroxyurea in SCD is more greatly mediated by effects on the vasculature and vaso-occlusion, possibly because of the lowered neutrophil counts (untreated individuals with SCD usually exhibit some level of neutrophilia), which are not major considerations in thalassemia. Hydroxyurea would not be expected to lead to improvements in alpha thalassemia because its major mechanism of action is increasing production of the beta-like gamma globin chains used to make HbF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of beta thalassemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Addition of erythropoietin to counteract the myelosuppressive effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> was tested in a 2013 randomized trial involving 80 transfusion-dependent children and adolescents with beta thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. This trial found that, compared with hydroxyurea alone, addition of erythropoietin to hydroxyurea was associated with decreased transfusion requirements (transfusion independence in 38 versus 15 percent) and increased hemoglobin levels. While this result is encouraging, we would require more evidence regarding the predictors of response and long-term toxicities of this approach before recommending it. Although efforts remain active in attempting to define a role for hydroxyurea in treating thalassemia, the available evidence does not support its use outside of a defined clinical trial setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2595193166\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL TESTING AND GENETIC COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing and counseling are offered as a part of routine care and family planning for all individuals with thalassemia of any severity, including alpha or beta thalassemia trait.

It is reasonable to omit folic acid supplements if this is especially burdensome to the patient or family <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if there is no clinical evidence of folate deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3670279773\" class=\"local\">'Vitamins and supplements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion therapy is used in individuals with thalassemia to reduce symptoms and morbidities associated with both anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis; ineffective erythropoiesis can lead to impaired growth and development in childhood, skeletal abnormalities, splenomegaly, and increased intestinal iron absorption with iron overload.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our approach to the use of transfusion therapy is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113996\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113996 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Overview of approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3086565743\" class=\"local\">'Management of anemia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Thalassemia major</strong> &ndash; Individuals with thalassemia major are transfusion-dependent due to anemia and various degrees of ineffective erythropoiesis. For these individuals, we suggest hypertransfusion (ie, regular transfusions to maintain the hemoglobin level above a certain value and suppress extramedullary hematopoiesis) rather than a more restrictive approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For most individuals with thalassemia major, we suggest a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of 9.5 to 10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> rather than a higher or lower nadir hemoglobin level (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This value is based on clinical experience and observational studies demonstrating that increasing hemoglobin with transfusion leads to reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis, and, for most individuals, a hemoglobin level in this range is sufficient. Different levels may be appropriate in individuals with certain comorbidities or in those without clinically significant ineffective erythropoiesis. (See <a href=\"#H455839550\" class=\"local\">'Decision to initiate regular transfusions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H235980892\" class=\"local\">'Typical hypertransfusion regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Thalassemia intermedia phenotype</strong> &ndash; Decisions regarding transfusion in patients with thalassemia intermedia are individualized based on the patient's age and specific disease complications (eg, activity limitations, impairment of growth and development, early appearance of skeletal changes). Most patients need only periodic transfusions for symptomatic relief or during periods of increased stress (eg, during periods of rapid growth, infection-associated bone marrow suppression, surgery, or pregnancy). Some patients may become dependent on regular transfusions; if this occurs, management is the same as for patients with thalassemia major. (See <a href=\"#H455839550\" class=\"local\">'Decision to initiate regular transfusions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Thalassemia minor</strong> &ndash; Chronic transfusion therapy is not required in patients with thalassemia minor since anemia is very mild or absent. Indications for transfusion are similar to the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving hypertransfusion therapy or periodic transfusions require regular assessment and treatment of excess iron stores. (See <a href=\"#H641704023\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of iron stores and initiation of chelation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-chelators-choice-of-agent-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron chelators: Choice of agent, dosing, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenectomy is an option for some patients with severe anemia, hypersplenism, or other splenic complications. Splenectomy may reduce transfusion requirements; however, the benefit may only be transient and must be weighed against the risks of thromboembolism and life-threatening infection. When pursued, splenectomy is generally deferred until the age of four years. Appropriate use of pre-splenectomy vaccines and prophylactic antibiotics is important for reducing the risk of sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H3208510339\" class=\"local\">'Role of splenectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative therapy for thalassemia that may be appropriate for those with severe disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113996\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113996 \">algorithm 1</a>). The decision whether, and when, to pursue HCT for a patient with thalassemia is highly complex and should be made only in consultation with a thalassemia specialist and an experienced high-volume transplant center. (See <a href=\"#H3879790468\" class=\"local\">'Decision to pursue allogeneic HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with thalassemia major are typically cared for by a specialist and seen at least two to four times a year to monitor progression of any of the major morbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F114017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114017 \">table 3</a>). Our approach to monitoring and managing disease complications includes close attention to iron stores as well as attention to the issues noted above. (See <a href=\"#H979880362\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and management of disease complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several drug therapies and gene therapy approaches for thalassemia are under investigation. Agents that reduce TGF-beta signaling and alter erythropoietic programs appear promising. (See <a href=\"#H61767539\" class=\"local\">'Investigational disease-modifying approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing and counseling is offered as a part of routine care and family planning for all individuals with thalassemia of any severity.

Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of death in thalassemia major.
