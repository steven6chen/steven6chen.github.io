However, in contrast to ALL in children, relapse rates remain high and long-term survival rates are approximately 25 to 50 percent, depending upon patient age and disease characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

To be effective, the survival benefit should outweigh the greater expense and higher risk of early toxicity and death, and late complications such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) and sterility. Allo-HCT is commonly used as part of the post-remission therapy of patients with ALL demonstrating high-risk features, such as the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome or a Ph-like molecular signature. Results have been best when allo-HCT is performed in first complete remission (CR), but allo-HCT can also cure some patients in second CR.</p><p>This topic review will discuss general issues in hematopoietic cell transplantation for ALL in adults including: selection of the donor, preparative chemoradiotherapy, and the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Outcomes with this procedure in different subsets of adults with ALL are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-remission therapy for Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term for transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation).

However, fewer than 25 percent of patients in the transplantable age group have an HLA-matched sibling donor. Allo-HCT using a partially matched family member donor or umbilical cord blood is a reasonable option for patients who do not have an HLA-identical matched donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Treatment related mortality (TRM) is still high using this treatment modality, and it increases further with age. However, MUD-HCT is generally available now for adults up to 65 to 70 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Unrelated donors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the efficacy of MUD-HCT for adults with ALL is difficult because most available data come from registries and include a large proportion of children. The range of findings can be illustrated by the following studies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) retrospectively compared 191 MUD-HCT recipients with 382 autologous-HCT recipients for acute leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients were matched for diagnosis, age, stage of disease, and year of transplantation. TRM was higher with MUD-HCT (44 versus 15 percent) but the relapse rate was lower (32 versus 55 percent). The two-year leukemia-free-survival (LFS) for all patients with ALL was similar in both groups (39 and 32 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series compared the results of 337 patients with ALL who received MUD-HCT (only 36 percent of whom were more than 18 years of age) with 214 patients with ALL who underwent autologous-HCT during the period from 1987 to 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The TRM for adults undergoing MUD-HCT in second complete remission (CR2) was 48 percent and was even higher for other stages of disease (57 to 68 percent). The relapse rate was approximately 26 percent at one year. For adults in CR2, MUD-HCT yielded an LFS of 42 percent compared with zero percent after auto-HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of the experience (1988 to 1990) with MUD-HCT facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) described 127 adults with poor risk ALL [ie, presence of t(9;22), t(4;11), or t(1;19)], with an age range from 16 to 54 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At two years, the cumulative incidence of TRM was 61 percent, while overall survival was 40, 17, and 5 percent for patients transplanted in CR1, CR2 or CR3, or relapsed or resistant disease, respectively. For patients transplanted in CR1, overall survival was 32 percent at four years, with a cumulative incidence of relapse of 13 percent.

The vast majority of patients had at least one feature of poor risk disease.

A retrospective analysis of 641 adults who underwent allogeneic HCT in CR1 compared the outcomes of patients who underwent related HCT (48 percent) with those who underwent MUD-HCT in Japan between 1993 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. When compared with those with a related donor, patients with an unrelated donor had similar survival rates (62 versus 65 percent at four years), lower relapse rates (22 versus 32 percent), higher rates of nonrelapse mortality (27 versus 14 percent), and higher rates of grade II-IV acute GVHD (42 versus 30 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Partially matched family member</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another option, which would significantly increase donor availability, is to use T-cell depleted stem cells from related donors with one fully mismatched HLA haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Most studies of allo-HCT in ALL have used myeloablative preparative regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Preparative regimen intensity defined'</a>.)</p><p>Myeloablative preparative regimens use very high, &quot;supralethal,&quot; doses of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation in an attempt to improve upon the results of conventional treatment. The use of these doses is based upon the dose-response relationship observed in hematologic malignant diseases in general and in ALL in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Relapse of disease is responsible for a large proportion of failures from allo-HCT in ALL, suggesting that current conditioning regimes do not eradicate tumor cells sufficiently. Further intensification is limited by parallel increases in treatment-related mortality (TRM). There is no generally agreed upon best preparative regimen prior to transplant regimen, although total body irradiation (TBI) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> is the most widely used. For older patients, reduced intensity conditioning regimens are increasingly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Total body irradiation (TBI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total body irradiation is either fractionated over three to five days or given as a single dose. Fractionated TBI is less toxic to normal cells but large radiation doses are more effective at killing resistant tumor cells. Studies in adults with ALL found that single dose TBI was associated with a significantly higher TRM but also a lower relapse rate than fractionated TBI; there was no difference in the overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Total body irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of cataracts, the incidence of which is higher with single dose than fractionated TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one study of 2149 patients with acute leukemia, from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, the overall 10-year estimated cataract incidence was 60 percent with single dose TBI, 43 percent with fractionated TBI with six or less fractions, and 7 percent with fractionated TBI with more than six fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy in combination with TBI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of TBI plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> is the most common preparative regimen used prior to allo-HCT for ALL. Agents other than cyclophosphamide have been evaluated in combination with TBI in attempts to further intensify the conditioning regimen. Cytosine arabinoside (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>), for example, has potent antileukemic activity, although the data do not indicate a benefit compared with cyclophosphamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].

For patients in second CR, TBI plus etoposide was associated with reduced rates of relapse, treatment failure, and mortality, but the advantage for etoposide was overcome when a TBI dose &ge;13 Gy was used together with cyclophosphamide; there were no differences in clinical outcomes for patients in first CR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy without TBI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts have been made to replace TBI in order to improve the antileukemic effectiveness of the conditioning regimen and to reduce TRM and long-term complications.
