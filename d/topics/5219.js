MS is characterized pathologically by multifocal areas of demyelination with loss of oligodendrocytes and astroglial scarring. Axonal injury is increasingly recognized as a prominent pathologic feature of MS. Certain clinical features are typical of MS, but the disease has a highly variable pace and many atypical forms.</p><p>The diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and unusual presentations of MS are reviewed here.

The core requirement for the diagnosis is the demonstration of central nervous system lesion dissemination in time and space, based upon either clinical findings alone or a combination of clinical and MRI findings. The history and physical examination are most important for diagnostic purposes. MRI is the test of choice to support the clinical diagnosis of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The McDonald diagnostic criteria include specific MRI criteria for the demonstration of lesions dissemination in time and space (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'McDonald criteria'</a> below). While useful when the diagnosis of MS is clinically suspected, the McDonald criteria are not intended for distinguishing MS from other neurologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of MS is relatively straightforward for patients who present with symptoms and MRI neuroimaging findings that are typical for MS and have a relapsing-remitting course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The typical patient presents as a young adult with one or more clinically distinct episodes of central nervous system dysfunction such as optic neuritis, long tract <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs,</span> a brainstem syndrome, or a spinal cord syndrome, followed by at least partial resolution. Symptoms usually develop over the course of hours to days and then gradually remit over the ensuing weeks to months, though remission may not be complete. Presenting symptoms and signs may be either monofocal (consistent with a single lesion) or multifocal (consistent with more than one lesion). While there are no clinical findings that are unique to MS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical symptoms and signs'</a>), some are highly characteristic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63940 \">table 1</a>). Common presenting symptoms of MS are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61789 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Diagnostic difficulties arise in patients who have atypical presentations, monophasic episodes, or progressive illness from onset (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). In these cases, investigative studies in addition to MRI such as evoked potentials and cerebrospinal fluid analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76227\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76227 \">table 3</a>) are often needed to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other possibilities. Additionally, some individuals have characteristic MRI lesions without symptoms, often discovered in the diagnostic workup for other conditions (ie, headaches). These cases, termed radiographically isolated syndrome, present an additional diagnostic difficulty. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Radiologically isolated syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for MS developed in the early 1980s (the Poser criteria) considered clinical characteristics and a number of laboratory studies including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials, and neuroimaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These findings were then used to place patients in categories ranging from clinically definite to laboratory supported definite to clinically probable to laboratory supported probable MS. The Poser criteria were developed primarily to ensure that only MS patients were included in research studies. They have been supplanted by the McDonald criteria, which were developed in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and subsequently revised in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Future revisions are likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">McDonald criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The McDonald criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], first developed in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and revised in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], were revised again in 2010 in order to incorporate newer evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] and to simplify the use of neuroimaging while preserving the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The core requirement of the diagnosis is the objective demonstration of dissemination of central nervous system lesions in both space and time, based upon either clinical findings alone or a combination of clinical and MRI findings. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dissemination in space</strong> is demonstrated with MRI by one or more T2 lesions in at least two of four MS-typical regions of the central nervous system (periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal cord) <strong>or</strong> by the development of a further clinical attack implicating a different central nervous system site.

However, it is desirable to confirm the diagnosis of MS through imaging or laboratory testing. If MRI and other tests (eg, cerebrospinal fluid) are negative, alternative diagnoses must be considered. To be comfortable with the diagnosis of MS, there cannot be a better explanation for the clinical presentation, and there must be supportive objective clinical evidence (ie, on physical examination).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with two or more attacks who have objective clinical evidence of one lesion, the criteria require evidence of <strong>dissemination in space</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with one attack who have objective clinical evidence of two or more lesions, the criteria require evidence of <strong>dissemination in time</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with one attack who have objective clinical evidence of one lesion (ie, a clinically isolated syndrome [CIS]), the criteria require evidence of <strong>dissemination in space and time</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with insidious neurological progression suggestive of primary progressive MS, the criteria require evidence of the one year of disease progression (retrospectively or prospectively determined) plus two of the three following criteria (for patients with brainstem or spinal cord syndromes, symptomatic MRI lesions are excluded from the criteria and do not contribute to lesion count):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dissemination in space in the brain based upon one or more T2 lesions in at least one area characteristic for MS (periventricular, juxtacortical, or infratentorial)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dissemination in space in the spinal cord based upon two or more T2 lesions in the cord</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive cerebrospinal fluid findings with isoelectric focusing evidence of oligoclonal bands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated IgG index </p><p/><p>An MS attack (also called a relapse or exacerbation) is defined by the McDonald criteria as a patient-reported or objectively observed event typical of an acute inflammatory demyelinating event in the central nervous system, and can be either current or historical, with duration of at least 24 hours, in the absence of fever or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most common initial attacks are sensory disturbances, motor weakness, and visual complaints (either monocular visual loss or diplopia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical symptoms and signs'</a>.)</p><p>The attack should be confirmed by a neurologic examination, but some historical events with symptoms and evolution characteristic for MS, for which no objective neurologic findings are documented, can provide reasonable evidence of a prior demyelinating event. Paroxysmal symptoms should consist of multiple episodes occurring over a minimum of 24 hours. Before a definite diagnosis of MS can be made, at least one attack must be confirmed by findings on either neurologic examination, visual evoked potential response in patients with prior visual disturbance, or MRI consistent with demyelination in central nervous system region associated with the prior neurologic symptoms.</p><p>The McDonald criteria assign diagnostic confidence as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of &quot;MS&quot; is given if the criteria are fulfilled and there is no better explanation for the clinical presentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of &quot;possible MS&quot; is given if MS is suspected but the criteria are not completely met</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of &quot;not MS&quot; is given if another diagnosis better explains the clinical presentation</p><p/><p>The application of the McDonald criteria in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis is discussed separately.

The McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS include specific MRI criteria for the demonstration of lesion dissemination in time and space as discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Lesion characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic lesion demonstrated on MRI is the cerebral or spinal plaque. Pathologically, plaques consist of a discrete region of demyelination with relative preservation of axons. However, mounting evidence suggests that axonal injury is a prominent pathologic feature of MS, and that axonal loss may occur either as part of the demyelinating process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], or as an independent process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Histological examination of active plaques reveals perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes (predominantly T cells) and macrophages with occasional plasma cells. Perivascular and interstitial edema may be prominent.</p><p>Plaques suggestive of MS are typically found on MRI in the periventricular region, corpus callosum, centrum semiovale, and, to a lesser extent, deep white matter structures and basal ganglia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61864\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61864 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73197\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73197 \">image 2</a>). MS plaques usually have an ovoid appearance, and lesions are arranged at right angles to the corpus callosum as if radiating from this area. When viewed on sagittal images, they are referred to as Dawson fingers. The plaques appear hyperintense on proton density and T2-weighted studies, and they are hypointense (if visible at all) on T1-weighted images.</p><p>Conventional T2-weighted MRI techniques may underestimate MS plaque size and thus overall plaque burden, particularly for cortical lesions. Advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy frequently reveal involvement of normal appearing white matter in patients with MS. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Advances in MRI techniques'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic utility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI detects many more MS lesions than CT, and it is able to detect plaques in regions that are rarely abnormal on CT such as the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73197\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73197 \">image 2</a>). Most lesions seen on MRI correlate with pathologic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, some lesions that are extensive on MRI show only small plaques on pathological examination, suggesting that much of the abnormal MRI signal may be a result of increased water content of the brain around such plaques, due to presumed disruption of the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Patients with clinically definite MS have typical white matter lesions on MRI in nearly all cases. However, central nervous system lesions due to other disorders (eg, ischemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, other vasculitides, HTLV-I, sarcoidosis) may appear similar to MS lesions on MRI. This is particularly true for ischemic lesions, which make MRI criteria less reliable for the diagnosis of MS in patients over the age of 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for the diagnosis of MS varies widely in different studies, and the variation is probably due to differences among the studies in MRI criteria and patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In one early study of 1500 brain MRI scans that included 134 scans of patients with a clinical diagnosis of MS, using the criteria of three or four areas of increased signal intensity resulted in a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of MS (90 and 87 percent, respectively), but a low specificity (71 and 74 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Accuracy was improved by using criteria that included at least three areas of increased signal intensity plus two of the following features: lesions abutting body of lateral ventricles; infratentorial lesion location; and size &gt;5 mm. Using these criteria, sensitivity decreased slightly to 81 percent while specificity improved to 96 percent. In a later study evaluating MRI diagnostic criteria that were eventually incorporated into the revised 2010 McDonald criteria, the sensitivity and specificity were approximately 53 and 87 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>MRI scanning is more sensitive and specific for predicting evolution to clinically definite MS than other studies such as CT scans, cerebrospinal fluid parameters, or evoked potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This was illustrated in a two-year follow-up of 200 patients referred for suspected MS that found 30 percent (50 percent of those under age 50 years) had developed clinically definite MS, of whom 84 percent had initial MRI scans that were strongly suggestive of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In contrast, the proportion of patients who had cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands, abnormal visual evoked potentials, or an abnormal CT when initially studied was 69, 69, and 38 percent, respectively. In a second, five-year study of 89 patients, progression to clinically definite MS occurred in 37 out of 57 (65 percent) with an initially abnormal MRI, and only 1 of 32 (3 percent) with a normal MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Again, MRI was a better predictor of progression to clinically definite MS than cerebrospinal fluid analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal cord MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord MRI lesions are nearly as common as brain lesions in patients with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], though they are less likely to be clinically silent than brain lesions. In contrast, the frequency of abnormal signals on spinal cord MRI in normal individuals is only 3 percent, since the non-MS-related hyperintense signal seen in older patients on cranial MRI does not occur in the spinal cord. Furthermore, spinal cord atrophy in patients with MS correlates with clinical disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>Spinal cord MRI may increase the likelihood of finding dissemination of MS lesions in space and improve diagnostic sensitivity compared with brain MRI alone. The potential utility of spinal MRI in MS is illustrated by a study of 104 patients with early stage MS and low disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The diagnosis of MS was made by the 1982 criteria of Poser et al [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Abnormal cord MRI lesions were found in 83 percent, and these lesions were typically focal; focal cord lesions were usually multiple (median 3), small (median 0.8 vertebral segments), and located most often in the cervical cord (56 percent). Diffuse lesions were found in 13 percent, usually in conjunction with focal lesions. In this cohort of patients, the addition of spinal cord to brain MRI lesions, compared with brain MRI alone, increased the diagnostic sensitivity of the original 2001 McDonald criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] from 66 to 85 percent.</p><p>Spinal cord lesions typical of MS are associated with the following MRI characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/6,21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21,25,26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Little or no cord swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unequivocal hyperintensity on T2-weighted sequences and visible in two planes (eg, axial and sagittal) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size at least 3 mm but less than two vertebral segments in length</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupy only part of the cord in cross-section</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal (ie, clearly delineated and circumscribed on T2-weighted sequences)</p><p/><p>Longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions, particularly those that exceed three spinal segments and mainly involve the central cord on axial MRI sections, are suggestive of neuromyelitis optica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Neuromyelitis optica'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Active versus chronic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute MS lesions tend to be larger than chronic lesions on MRI with somewhat ill-defined margins. As resolution occurs, they become smaller with sharper margins. This presumably reflects reduction of edema and inflammation present at the time of acute plaque formation, leaving only residual areas of demyelination, gliosis, and enlarged extracellular space with remission. The MRI appearance of primary progressive MS shows a smaller total disease burden, a greater preponderance of small lesions, fewer gadolinium enhancing new lesions, and acquisition of fewer lesions per unit time than the secondary progressive form of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Gadolinium-DTPA, a paramagnetic contrast agent that can cross only disrupted blood-brain barriers, has been used to assess plaque activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Gadolinium increases signal intensity on T1-weighted images. It is not completely clear if inflammation is the triggering event that causes demyelination and axonal degeneration, but gadolinium enhancement diminishes or disappears after treatment with glucocorticoids, a therapy thought to restore integrity of the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Gadolinium (Gd) enhancing lesions on T1-weighted MRI often correspond to areas of high signal on T2-weighted and low signal intensity on unenhanced T1-weighted images, probably due to edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61864\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61864 \">image 1</a>). The importance of Gd-enhancing lesions in MS is related to the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accumulation of gadolinium in plaques is associated with new or newly active plaques and with pathologically confirmed acute inflammation in MS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of Gd-enhancing plaques are clinically asymptomatic, although the presence of ongoing enhancement suggests continuing disease activity that likely contributes to cumulative pathophysiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of lesions on T2-weighted MRI will show contrast enhancement at some point if followed over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gadolinium enhancement is a transient phenomenon in MS and usually disappears after 30 to 40 days, but it may rarely persist for up to eight weeks in acute plaques.

These hypointense lesions are nonspecific at a given time point, as nearly half will revert to normal in a few months. The disappearance of a black hole is most likely due to remyelination and resolution of edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Although the evidence is limited, persistent black holes are thought to be markers of severe demyelination and axonal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The pathological substrate for the accumulation of persisting black holes appears to be predominantly axonal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/47,48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48,51</a>], as shown in a postmortem histopathology-MRI correlation study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Such focal axonal loss most likely contributes to Wallerian degeneration.

In addition, conventional MRI techniques do not distinguish other manifestations of MS pathology such as demyelination, remyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can provide information on phospholipid metabolism, and proton MRS can generate information about other metabolic components, such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, an exclusively neuronal marker), creatine phosphate (Cr, an energy marker), choline containing compounds (membrane components), and lactic acid (LA). Chronic MS is associated with a reduction of NAA in comparison with choline and Cr within the brain. A reduced <span class=\"nowrap\">NAA/Cr</span> ratio is the common means of expressing such reduction. This reduced ratio implies loss of neurons or axons, which is consistent with pathological studies and appears to parallel disability in MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, the whole-brain concentration of NAA may be a sensitive surrogate marker of neuronal loss in MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>Diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI imaging as well as MRS may provide insight into the axonal loss and diffuse abnormalities in normal appearing white matter and the evolution of normal appearing gray matter that can occur in MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Quantitative MRI methods such as magnetization transfer ratio are increasingly used to assess myelin content and axonal count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Diffusion tensor imaging allows measurement of fractional anisotropy, which reflects the degree to which the diffusion of water molecules follows one direction versus many directions. This technique is useful for assessing the integrity of white matter tracts, which normally have a high degree of anisotropy due to their linear arrangement and the preferred diffusion of water along the long axis of the myelinated fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Injury to nerve axons or myelin sheaths permits increased diffusion of water across the white matter tract and thereby decreases fractional anisotropy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52184\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52184 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>Normal appearing white matter that is immediately adjacent to plaques seen on T2 imaging may have abnormally reduced anisotropy. As an example, a study that evaluated 36 white matter plaques in 20 patients with MS found that mean plaque size, as measured by a 40 percent reduction in fractional anisotropy, was significantly increased (145 percent) compared with the size measured by conventional T2-weighted imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>The pathologic correlate of the decreased fractional anisotropy in white matter that appears normal on T2-weighted MRI is uncertain. One possibility is that demyelination and axonal disruption at the periphery of a centrifugally expanding plaque is less severe than at the center; the peripheral injury is sufficient to cause reduced anisotropy but not sufficient to cause increased T2 signal. Another possibility is that the periphery is undergoing regression and repair.</p><p>Although MS predominately affects white matter, involvement of cortical gray matter is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>]. Conventional T2-weighted MRI sequences may underestimate MS plaque size and thus overall plaque burden, particularly for cortical lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Visualization of gray matter lesions may be improved with the use of MRI techniques, including seven-Tesla MRI, two and three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, double inversion recovery imaging, phase-sensitive inversion recovery T1-weighted sequences, and diffusion tensor imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/65,68,70-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,68,70-76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lumbar puncture is not a requirement for the diagnosis of MS in patients with classic MS symptoms and brain MRI appearance, but it can be used to help rule out the diagnosis in equivocal cases. Qualitative assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for oligoclonal IgG bands (OCBs) using isoelectric focusing is the most important diagnostic CSF study when determining a diagnosis of MS in such cases. Elevation of the CSF immunoglobulin level relative to other protein components is a common finding in patients with MS and suggests intrathecal synthesis. The immunoglobulin increase is predominantly IgG, although the synthesis of IgM and IgA is also increased.</p><p>The 2010 McDonald criteria note that positive CSF findings can provide supportive evidence that the underlying disorder is inflammatory demyelinating, and incorporate them into the criteria for primary progressive MS. However, in contrast to the earlier 2001 and 2005 McDonald criteria, the CSF findings are <strong>not</strong> incorporated into the 2010 criteria for dissemination in space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>A positive CSF is based upon the finding of either OCBs different from any such bands in serum, or by an increased IgG index.

An abnormality of CSF IgG production as measured by the IgG index or IgG synthesis rate is found in 90 percent of clinically definite MS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>The CSF appearance and pressure are grossly normal in MS.

Lymphocytes are the predominant cell type, the vast majority of which are T cells. CSF protein (or albumin) level is usually normal. Albumin is not synthesized in the central nervous system, and albumin determination therefore gives a better indication of blood-CSF-barrier disruption than total protein, some of which may be synthesized within the central nervous system (eg, immunoglobulin).</p><p>The technique for performing a lumbar puncture in adults is discussed separately.

Evoked potentials also may help define the anatomical site of the lesion in tracts not easily visualized by imaging (eg, optic nerves, dorsal columns).</p><p>The three most frequently used evoked potentials are somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), visual evoked responses (VER), and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP).

One optic nerve may be affected sequentially after another, or there can be simultaneous bilateral visual loss, a state that is uncommon in classic MS. In some instances, brain MRI will show scattered intracerebral lesions in addition to lesions of the optic nerves, or cerebrospinal fluid examination will show oligoclonal bands, attesting to some degree of dissemination of the lesions. Children and preadolescent patients are more likely than adults to have recurrent or simultaneous optic neuropathy. The distinction from an MS variant can be challenging. Sarcoidosis is commonly a diagnostic consideration in patients with bilateral optic neuritis. Other potential causes of recurrent optic neuritis in the differential include lupus, chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION), and paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (serum <span class=\"nowrap\">CRMP-5/CV2</span> antibody).

Minor clues suggestive of MS include the presence of a Lhermitte sign (a term for electric shock-like sensations that run down the back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limbs upon flexion of the neck) or an undue sensitivity to elevated temperature. Nevertheless, a syndrome of slowly progressive upper motor neuron dysfunction can present a major diagnostic challenge, since a single demyelinating lesion can produce a progressive myelopathy similar to primary progressive MS. As an example, one case series described 30 patients who developed progressive motor impairment attributable to a single demyelinating lesion on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The progressive impairments in this group were <span class=\"nowrap\">hemiparesis/monoparesis</span> (n = 24), quadriparesis (n = 5), and paraparesis (n = 1). These deficits were attributed to solitary demyelinating lesions identified by MRI in the cervical spinal cord (n = 18), cervicomedullary junction and brainstem region (n = 6), thoracic spinal cord (n = 4), and subcortical white matter (n = 2). With a median follow-up from symptom onset of 100 months, none had clinical symptoms suggestive of relapses affecting other portions of the central nervous system, and no new lesions were found in the patients who had repeat MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord. Oligoclonal bands or an elevated IgG index were present in 13 of 26 (50 percent) patients. There was no evidence suggesting another etiology for progressive myelopathy, such as neuromyelitis optica.</p><p>The treatment of progressive solitary sclerosis is not well-studied but can be approached in the same manner as primary progressive MS.

Motor neuron disease may be the cause if there are no sensory signs or symptoms (primary lateral sclerosis). HTLV-I infection, B12 deficiency, and HIV infection can all be excluded by appropriate testing. Spinal dural arteriovenous malformation can cause a steadily or stepwise progressive myelopathy, usually in the lower spinal segments, and usually in older patients.

Once considered a variant of multiple sclerosis, NMO is now recognized as a distinct clinical entity based upon the presence of the disease-specific anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody, which plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of NMO.

Hallmark features of NMO include acute attacks of bilateral or rapidly sequential optic neuritis (leading to visual loss) and transverse myelitis (often causing limb weakness and bladder dysfunction) with a typically relapsing course. Central nervous system involvement outside of the optic nerves and spinal cord is also recognized in NMO and NMO spectrum disorders. Other suggestive symptoms include episodes of intractable vomiting or hiccoughs, excessive daytime somnolence or narcolepsy, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, neuroendocrine disorders, and (in children) seizures. While no clinical features are disease-specific, some are highly characteristic. NMO has a relapsing course in 90 percent or more of cases.
