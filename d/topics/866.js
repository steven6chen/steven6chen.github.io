Some studies, for example, have reported incidences of anemia that approach 40 percent at one year posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/2,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,11</a>]. In addition, renal transplant recipients restarting dialysis have lower hemoglobin (Hgb) levels when compared with nontransplant chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (Hgb levels of 8.9 versus 10.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> respectively), which correlate with increased hospitalizations and higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as epoetin may reduce the frequency and severity of anemia in patients with failing transplants, but have not been shown to reduce mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite the supposition that renal transplant recipients receive more care from nephrologists, iron status evaluation and appropriate epoetin therapy occur in only 25 percent of transplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The reasons for this inadequate care are unclear.</p><p>Left ventricular hypertrophy, an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality among patients with CKD, may be in part a consequence of untreated anemia. Since cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in diabetic renal transplant recipients, the adverse effects of anemia may be more evident in diabetic renal transplant recipients in the United States, when compared with other nationalities, as the US transplant population has a relatively higher cardiovascular risk profile, with a higher percentage of diabetic patients.</p><p>Therefore, treatment of anemia using iron therapy and ESAs has been hypothesized to decrease the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. However, a study of 825 transplant recipients showed that, in multivariate analyses, anemia was not associated with all-cause mortality, but was associated with 25 percent greater risk of allograft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Treatment of anemia does improve quality of life and reduces the requirement for transfusions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-anemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of anemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will address anemia and renal transplant recipients. Anemia associated with CKD in the nontransplant setting, as well as the benefits of the treatment of anemia in the setting of CKD, are also discussed elsewhere. Both topic reviews are relevant since most transplant recipients have an average glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, a level consistent with the current definition of CKD.

By three months posttransplant, Hgb levels generally rise and then subsequently fall in those with progressive allograft dysfunction. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At six months posttransplant, approximately one-half of patients have a Hgb level that is below normal (defined here as &lt;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in males and &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in females) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/2,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At one year, 10 to 40 percent are anemic despite having normal graft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/2,7,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,11,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first five-year posttransplant period, approximately one-third of patients have Hgb levels that are &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. More severe anemia, characterized by a Hgb level &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> occurs in 12 to 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a registry study from 20 European countries, of 3699 pediatric patients transplanted between 2000 and 2012, 49.8 and 7.8 percent of the patients were anemic, according to the National Kidney Foundation <span class=\"nowrap\">(NKF)/Kidney</span> Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(K/DOQI)</span> classification and the UK-National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Hgb levels were strongly associated with graft function. Low Hgb levels were associated with an increased risk of graft failure or combined graft failure and death, but not with death alone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, multiple surveys have found certain risk factors to be associated with the development of anemia in the renal transplant patient. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large European survey of patients six months to five years posttransplant, lower hemoglobin (Hgb) levels were associated with increased acute rejection events and increased donor age (particularly &gt;60 years), decreased creatinine clearance, and a renal allograft other than the first allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After five years, risk factors for anemia that have been identified on multivariate analyses include recipient age &lt;45 years, female, nonwhite race, decreased renal function, nondiabetic patients, and lower serum albumin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/2-4,6,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,6,17,18</a>].</p><p/><p>Several studies have found that donor type, such as living- versus deceased-donor transplant, plays no role in the occurrence of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/2-4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Early posttransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anemia immediately posttransplant is almost universally due to lower than normal Hgb targets in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population, surgical blood loss, and frequent phlebotomy. Dilutional anemia also occurs because of aggressive perioperative volume expansion. Recovery to normal adult Hgb concentrations can be hindered by allograft dysfunction and other clinical events, increased donor age, and iron deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Erythropoietin levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improvement of erythropoiesis after renal transplantation is due to erythropoietin (EPO) production in the allograft and the loss of the uremic milieu. In general, erythropoietin levels begin to rise on posttransplant day 2 and reach a fourfold elevation for two to three weeks, after which time restoration of negative feedback control occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Early erythropoietin surges may be inefficient in correcting anemia since the hormone seems to be inefficient in this persistent uremic setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Relative erythropoietin deficiency in the setting of allograft dysfunction is likely similar to that observed with anemia in patients with nontransplant-associated CKD.</p><p>However, endocrine function of the graft may not always correlate with excretory function, perhaps because peritubular interstitial cells, which produce erythropoietin, are selectively damaged or develop defective regulation. Anemia may also correct in some patients despite relatively low erythropoietin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Donor kidney characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold and warm ischemia times do not correlate with erythropoietin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, patients with delayed graft function have a slower rise in erythropoietin levels, which increase with improvement in graft function. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in the donor kidney at the time of transplant have been shown to associate independently with anemia at 12 months posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Iron deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency plays a major role in persistent anemia in the immediate posttransplant period. Despite the recognition of iron requirements for effective erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy, iron deficiency remains common among patients presenting for renal transplantation. Iron stores may be rapidly depleted posttransplant due to surgical blood loss, frequent phlebotomy, and utilization of stores for enhanced erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Return of regular menses resulting in iron losses may further contribute to iron deficiency in females.</p><p>However, the accurate assessment of iron deficiency posttransplant is limited by available assays. Ferritin is a well-known acute-phase reactant, and elevated levels may represent superimposed illness (eg, acute rejection and infection). Ferritin levels drop with iron utilization, but also rise with increased gastrointestinal iron absorption following transplantation. Thus, ferritin measurements have inconsistently reflected iron stores among renal transplant recipients and do not always correlate with anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>].

However, the mean relative decrease in Hgb concentration with these drugs may only be 0.2 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The association of mycophenolate mofetil with anemia in large, retrospective studies has in part been attributed to its use in individuals with rejection episodes, but one study found that the mycophenolate metabolite 7-O-MPA glucuronide (MPAG), but not mycophenolic acid, strongly correlated with severity of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/4,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28</a>]. Importantly, MPAG, but not mycophenolic acid, accumulates with renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. By comparison, two retrospective studies have been unable to find an increase in anemia with azathioprine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sirolimus</a> (Rapamune) also causes marrow suppression and anemia, particularly early after initiation, but the effect may lessen over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>].

In one study of 214 renal or renal-pancreas allograft recipients treated with either a sirolimus- or mycophenolate mofetil-based regimen, the prevalence of anemia at one year posttransplant was significantly higher with sirolimus (57 versus 31 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Passenger leukocyte syndrome most commonly occurs following transplantation of an organ from a donor with ABO-O blood type into a recipient with ABO-A or B blood type, or following transplantation of an organ from an Rh (-) donor into an Rh (+) recipient. The donor organ contains B cells and plasma cells (so-called passenger leukocytes) that produce anti-isoagglutinin or anti-Rh antibodies that lead to the syndrome.

Because of lower expense and the ability to administer a larger iron dose, we usually use the INFeD brand of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-dextran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron dextran</a> as our iron infusion of choice. We prefer not to use the Dexferrum brand of iron dextran (which has a higher molecular weight), due to a higher incidence of adverse reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. We always give a 25 mg test dose in 50 mL of saline IV, with appropriate precautions for treatment of an anaphylactic reaction. If that is tolerated, we generally administer 1000 mg by slow IV infusion. This is usually done during the initial transplant hospitalization stay. Among persistently anemic patients, this can be repeated as necessary in an outpatient infusion center to maintain the hemoglobin (Hgb) level &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> the transferrin saturation &gt;30 percent, and serum ferritin &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-and-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Alternatively, we sometimes administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferumoxytol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferumoxytol</a> (Feraheme) as a 510 mg infusion at visits as needed (each separated by at least three to eight days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is allergic to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-dextran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron dextran</a>, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferumoxytol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferumoxytol</a> (Feraheme) as two 510 mg infusions approximately one week apart. Alternatively, we administer sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric gluconate</a> complex at a dose of 250 mg on four different occasions, usually weekly for four weeks, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-sucrose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron sucrose</a> 300 mg IV over two hours on three separate occasions, each separated by 14 days. The advantage of these preparations is that, unlike iron dextran, they have not been associated with fatal anaphylactic reactions, but are more expensive and less convenient than a single iron dextran infusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with persistent anemia, we assess iron status at approximately 8- to 12-week intervals. In our experience, oral iron has been inadequate to replace or maintain adequate iron stores and may bind with immunosuppressant medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF).

With anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurring more than three months posttransplant in the iron-replete patient, we may initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoetin alfa</a>. The patient should be apprised of the risks of stroke, thrombotic events, and possibly increased risk of recurrent cancer prior to ESA use. In the United States, Medicare guidelines mandate that patients with CKD receive ESA in a physician's office, which is inconvenient for the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyporesponse to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoetin alfa</a>, an alternative is to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darbepoetin-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darbepoetin alfa</a> (Aranesp) because of its longer half-life, which may permit less frequent administration. Darbepoetin carries the same risks as other ESAs. We initiate darbepoetin alfa at a dose of 0.45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> subcutaneously, which is given once per week. However, darbepoetin is more expensive than epoetin alfa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have returned to dialysis and are resistant to ESAs may benefit from allograft nephrectomy.
