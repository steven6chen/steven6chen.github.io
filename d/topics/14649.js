HHV-8 is also causally linked to primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman&rsquo;s disease. The widespread application of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a striking decrease in the incidence of KS and has changed its natural history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and complications of pulmonary AIDS-associated KS are discussed here.

However, pulmonary involvement can be the initial manifestation of KS and occurs in the absence of mucocutaneous disease in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Pulmonary KS can involve the lung parenchyma, airways, pleura, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrathoracic lymph nodes. There are no unique manifestations that distinguish KS from other pathologic processes in the lungs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenchymal lung involvement is usually manifest clinically by dyspnea, hypoxemia, and dry cough developing over a few weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Hemoptysis, fever, fatigue and occasionally respiratory failure can also occur. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endobronchial KS may be asymptomatic; however, intractable cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, upper airway obstruction, and atelectasis may occur. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural effusions are radiographically visualized in up to two-thirds of patients with parenchymal KS and occasionally may occur as an isolated manifestation of KS. However, large, difficult to manage pleural effusions are much less common since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pleural-effusions-in-hiv-infected-patients#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pleural effusions in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Kaposi sarcoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlarged mediastinal nodes are frequent in patients with pulmonary KS although the cause of the lymphadenopathy is often unclear. Adenopathy in patients suspected to have pulmonary KS is important because of the need to identify other diseases that can cause adenopathy, including opportunistic infections and other tumors.</p><p/><p>Rapid progression of pulmonary KS can be precipitated by systemic glucocorticoids, which are often used to treat other conditions in HIV infected patients. Thus, the possibility of pulmonary KS should be considered when pulmonary symptoms develop following the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy. </p><p>When evaluating a patient for possible pulmonary KS, a careful skin and mucous membrane exam is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

The evaluation of pulmonary symptoms in patients with HIV infection typically involves a combination of assessing the degree of immune compromise, imaging to ascertain the pattern and extent of lung, pleural, and mediastinal disease, thoracentesis if a pleural effusion is present, and often performing flexible bronchoscopy to obtain samples for immunoassay, stains, culture, and cytology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the HIV-infected patient with pulmonary symptoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793270\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a new diagnosis of KS is suspected in a patient with HIV infection, the degree of HIV-related immunosuppression is assessed by measuring the CD4 count and HIV viral load. Patients with KS typically have a low CD4 cell count (&lt;150 cells per cubic millimeter) and a high HIV viral load (&gt;10,000 copies per milliliter).

KS typically involves the lung parenchyma in one of two patterns on chest radiographs: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor infiltrating the septae presents radiographically as patchy reticular opacities that frequently occur in a peribronchovascular distribution. This pattern is seen in approximately 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ill-defined nodular densities are also common, occurring in approximately 25 percent of chest radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p/><p>Overlap radiographic patterns, areas of focal consolidation, a solitary nodule, coalescence of nodules, and normal radiographs can also be seen in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/6,7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,12,13</a>].</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) of the chest is typically obtained to evaluate abnormalities noted on chest radiograph or pulmonary function tests. In addition, CT is useful to evaluate hemoptysis in patients with a normal chest radiograph. </p><p>Two findings on chest CT are highly suggestive of parenchymal KS: hilar densities extending into the parenchyma along perivascular or peribronchial pathways and a characteristic septal or nodular pattern with concomitant pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/8,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14-16</a>]. Correlation between pathology and imaging has shown that central peribronchovascular opacities represent tumor growth involving the bronchovascular bundles, while nodules correspond to proliferations of neoplastic cells in the lung parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H792755\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are often performed in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary symptoms and parenchymal abnormalities on chest radiograph or chest CT scan. The main purposes are to examine the airways for endobronchial KS lesions and to obtain BAL samples for microbiologic stains and culture, immunoassays for infectious agents, and cytologic examination for viral inclusions or tumors other than KS. The diagnosis of KS cannot be made from cytologic specimens, as biopsy specimen is needed to see the characteristic architecture of spindle cells surrounding thin vascular channels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the HIV-infected patient with pulmonary symptoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Endobronchial KS lesions typically appear violaceous or bright red and are macular or papular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87393\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87393 \">picture 5</a>). Common sites include the mucosa of the lower airways, especially at branching points, or, less commonly, in the trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70662\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70662 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76580%7EPULM%2F78341\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76580 graphicRef78341 \">picture 7A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>]. Bacillary angiomatosis can also cause violaceous endobronchial mucosal lesions, but these lesions are typically raised or polypoid, while those of KS are typically flat.</p><p>Endobronchial and transbronchial biopsies have a low diagnostic yield for KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/10,12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,19</a>], although the occasional biopsy is positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77671\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77671 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81327\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81327 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78341\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78341 \">picture 7B</a>). We avoid performing transbronchial biopsies when KS is thought to be likely, as significant hemorrhage has occurred following biopsy of KS lesions in up to 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2891823\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracentesis and pleural biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main roles for thoracentesis and pleural biopsy in evaluating pleural KS are to exclude infection or other causes of malignant effusions (eg, multicentric Castleman&rsquo;s disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, lung cancer) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58777\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58777 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71626 \">table 2</a>). Thoracentesis may also be useful to relieve dyspnea when an effusion is large. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pleural-effusions-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pleural effusions in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>KS lesions are found on the visceral but not parietal pleura, so closed pleural biopsy is not useful for detecting pleural KS. On the other hand, closed pleural biopsy is often helpful in the diagnosis of pleural infections such as mycobacterial disease. Biopsy samples are sent for special stains, routine and mycobacterial culture, and pathology.</p><p>Video-assisted thoracoscopy is sometimes performed to evaluate an undiagnosed pleural effusion.

Spindle cells consistently stain for CD34 and commonly CD31 but are factor VIII negative. Polymerase chain reaction to detect amplified human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA sequences and immunohistochemical staining for HHV-8 antigen can be performed on biopsy specimens to confirm the diagnosis.

Pleural fluid cytology and pleural biopsies are not helpful in documenting KS, but they may be useful for excluding other processes (eg, infection, lymphoma). In cases of rapidly recurrent pleural effusion accumulation, alternative diagnoses (eg, pleural effusion lymphoma) should be entertained. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pleural KS are described separately.

Prior to the introduction of potent ART, pulmonary AIDS-related KS was associated with a very poor prognosis, with median survivals of 2 to 10 months in various reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/12,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21,22</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H13609290\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with asymptomatic pulmonary KS, we typically initiate ART without concomitant chemotherapy. In some cases, however, treatment of KS with ART alone may be associated with a flare of the KS. If there is evidence of progression of pulmonary KS after initiation of ART or if the patient has symptomatic pulmonary KS at presentation, systemic chemotherapy is generally indicated in addition to ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H13609141\" class=\"local\">'Systemic treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Staging and treatment&quot;, section on 'Combined antiretroviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although ART may be sufficient to induce regression of the KS in some cases, the addition of systemic chemotherapy is indicated in patients with symptomatic pulmonary involvement or evidence of disease progression despite ART.

This may include endoscopic laser resection, stent placement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2892199\" class=\"local\">'Airway obstruction and bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with pleural KS, we favor the use of repeated thoracentesis in combination with ART and chemotherapy over more invasive procedures. If a pleural effusion recurs quickly (eg, in less than three weeks) despite repeated thoracentesis, an indwelling pleural catheter can be placed or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> performed, although experience in pleural KS is limited.
