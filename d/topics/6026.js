Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) is the most common histologic site and type of uterine cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abnormal uterine bleeding is the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer. Occasionally, women with endometrial cancer who have no abnormal uterine bleeding present with abnormal findings on cervical cytology. Seventy-five to 90 percent of women with endometrial carcinoma present with abnormal uterine bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Occasionally, women with no abnormal uterine bleeding present with abnormal findings on cervical cytology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281205\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal uterine bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspicion of the presence of endometrial neoplasia (neoplastic endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma) depends upon symptoms, age, and the presence of risk factors. Abnormal uterine bleeding is present in approximately 75 to 90 percent of women with endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The amount of bleeding does not correlate with the risk of cancer. </p><p>For different patient populations, the following bleeding patterns should prompt endometrial evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postmenopausal women</strong> &ndash; Any bleeding, including spotting or staining. Three to 20 percent of women with postmenopausal bleeding are found to have endometrial carcinoma and another 5 to 15 percent have endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age 45 to menopause</strong> &ndash; Any abnormal uterine bleeding, including intermenstrual bleeding in women who are ovulatory, frequent (interval between the onset of bleeding episodes is less than 21 days), heavy (total volume of &gt;80 mL), or prolonged (longer than seven days). In addition, endometrial neoplasia should be suspected in women with prolonged periods of amenorrhea (six or more months) in women with anovulation. Among cases of endometrial carcinoma, 17 percent occur in women aged 45 to 54 years compared with 5 percent in those aged 35 to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Younger than 45 years</strong> &ndash; Abnormal uterine bleeding that is persistent, occurs in the setting of a history of unopposed estrogen exposure (obesity, chronic anovulation) or failed medical management of the bleeding, or in women at high risk of endometrial cancer (eg, Lynch syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Use of 45 years old as the threshold for increased concern regarding endometrial neoplasia is supported by evidence that the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma is fairly low prior to age 45 and increases with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This age threshold is also consistent with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines issued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, given the risk of endometrial neoplasia, abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding, requires further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postmenopausal uterine bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281213\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical cytology findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some cervical cytology findings are associated with endometrial neoplasia. Women with the following findings on cervical cytology require evaluation for endometrial neoplasia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adenocarcinoma</strong> &ndash; Adenocarcinoma is sometimes seen on cervical cytology. Since the malignant cells may arise from either the cervix or endometrium, further evaluation with cervical and endometrial biopsy is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atypical glandular cells</strong> &ndash; Atypical glandular cells detected by cervical cytology should be investigated with an endometrial (and endocervical) biopsy to determine whether an endometrial neoplasm is the cause.

Symptomatic or high-risk women still require evaluation as appropriate.

Prior to hysterectomy, all women with abnormal uterine bleeding should have endometrial sampling. Preoperative diagnosis of endometrial neoplasia aids surgical planning. </p><p>If metastatic disease is encountered intraoperatively, management depends upon the experience level of the surgeon. Intraoperative consultation from a gynecologic oncologist should be requested if available. Staging procedures performed by a gynecologic oncologist appear to lead to better patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If a gynecologic oncologist is not available and a surgeon is not experienced in operative management of the cancer (eg, lymphadenectomy), it is prudent to close the patient and arrange for prompt consultation with a specialist for a second procedure.</p><p>If endometrial carcinoma or hyperplasia is discovered after pathology evaluation of the hysterectomy specimen, the patient should be managed as appropriate.

The information gained also helps the examiner to avoid complications during endometrial sampling (eg, uterine perforation). The examination may detect a pelvic mass, although women with endometrial hyperplasia or early-stage endometrial carcinoma do not typically have an enlarged uterus. An enlarged, fixed uterus may be consistent with uterine leiomyomas or pelvic malignancy and warrants further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-sampling-procedures#H392000\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial sampling procedures&quot;, section on 'General procedure'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, pelvic examination helps to confirm that the source of the bleeding is the uterus and identify other possible etiologies of abnormal uterine bleeding (eg, uterine fibroids). It also aids surgical planning if surgical evaluation or treatment is indicated. Either a large or fixed uterus may make hysterectomy more difficult and may influence the choice of surgical route (eg, abdominal, laparoscopic).

For these women, it is reasonable to defer endometrial sampling if the endometrial thickness is &lt;4 mm. This approach is an alternative to endometrial sampling, which is the gold standard for evaluation for endometrial neoplasia. However, if a woman continues to have bleeding even with an endometrial stripe of &lt;4 mm, a biopsy should be performed.</p><p>In premenopausal women with suspected endometrial neoplasia, sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness <strong>cannot</strong> be used as an alternative to endometrial sampling.

(See <a href=\"#H282576\" class=\"local\">'Negative endometrial sampling'</a> below.)</p><p>Surgeons may choose to perform D&amp;C as the initial procedure in some women. This includes women who cannot tolerate an office biopsy, those with heavy bleeding (D&amp;C is both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure), and those who have a very high risk of endometrial cancer (eg, women with Lynch syndrome).

If two office endometrial biopsies have been unsuccessful, a D&amp;C should be performed. Cervical stenosis, a common cause of an unsuccessful biopsy, can be managed with preprocedure cervical preparation or dilation.

Transvaginal ultrasound, sonohysterography, or diagnostic hysteroscopy should be performed to exclude structural lesions (leiomyomas, endometrial polyp). Any structural lesions that are found should be treated as appropriate.

A higher grade may be assigned in as many as 30 percent of cases when the hysterectomy specimen is reviewed.

Women with Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer) have a markedly increased risk of endometrial cancer and should undergo screening, and ultimately, risk-reducing hysterectomy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1268046\"><span class=\"h2\">Women at average or increased risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine screening of asymptomatic women at average or increased risk of endometrial carcinoma is not advised. There are no high quality data to support the efficacy of screening for reducing endometrial cancer mortality.</p><p>This recommendation includes women with risk factors for endometrial cancer, with the exception of women with Lynch syndrome. Regarding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, a known risk factor for endometrial carcinoma, there are no expert recommendations for routine uterine cancer screening for asymptomatic patients. Any abnormal bleeding in a patient on tamoxifen warrants further evaluation. This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen#H94636198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Managing the side effects of tamoxifen&quot;, section on 'Screening for uterine tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Endometrial carcinoma has several characteristics that inform the recommendation against routine screening. As noted above, 75 to 90 percent of women with endometrial carcinoma present with abnormal uterine bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The majority of patients are diagnosed with disease confined to the uterus and have a greater than 90 percent five-year survival rate. Thus for this disease, the presence of early symptoms provides secondary prevention, detecting a condition when treatment can stop it from progressing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-approach-to-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based approach to prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early symptoms result in detection of most but not all cases of endometrial carcinoma at an early stage. However, another barrier to screening for this condition is that there is not a screening test that is sensitive, specific, and acceptable to patients and clinicians. </p><p>While some women with endometrial carcinoma present with abnormal findings on cervical cytology, this is not an effective screening test for this disease. The sensitivity of conventional Pap smear for endometrial carcinoma is 40 to 55 percent; the sensitivity of liquid-based preparations is higher, 60 to 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>Endometrial biopsy is a sensitive and specific test, but it is uncomfortable and invasive. The thickness of the endometrium on transvaginal sonography is also a sensitive test for detecting endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women; however, sensitivity is estimated to be 20 percent lower in asymptomatic compared with symptomatic women, and specificity is low (the false-positive rate is high); thus many women would end up needing an endometrial biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease#H3255342\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic women with endometrial thickening or fluid'</a>.)</p><p>This recommendation is consistent with advice from the American Cancer Society, which suggests that women at average or increased risk of developing endometrial cancer (except those with Lynch syndrome) be informed about their risks of developing the disease, educated about its symptoms (especially any unexpected bleeding) at the onset of menopause, and are strongly encouraged to report such symptoms to their health care provider promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

For postmenopausal women, transvaginal ultrasound evaluation of endometrial thickness may be used as an initial study to evaluate for endometrial neoplasia in selected women. For these women, it is reasonable to defer endometrial sampling if the endometrial thickness is &lt;4 mm. However, if postmenopausal bleeding persists, endometrial sampling should be performed. Sonography is <strong>not</strong> a valid alternative to endometrial sampling in premenopausal women.
