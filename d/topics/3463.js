The term chronic hand eczema is appropriate in cases that persist for more than three months or recur two or more times within a 12-month time frame [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Typical clinical signs include redness, thickening of the skin, scaling, edema, vesicles, areas of hyperkeratosis, cracks (fissures), and erosions. </p><p>Hand eczema is the most frequent occupational skin disease, especially among workers exposed to &quot;wet work,&quot; such as healthcare workers, food handlers, and hairdressers. It can have profound economic consequences, including medical costs, costs associated with disability, workers&rsquo; compensation, and rehabilitation, absence from work, and job loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Severe hand eczema can affect the patients&rsquo; psychosocial functioning and general wellbeing. </p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of chronic hand eczema. Acute palmoplantar eczema, irritant contact dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-palmoplantar-eczema-dyshidrotic-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute palmoplantar eczema (dyshidrotic eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irritant contact dermatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506386525\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hand eczema is a common problem in the general population. Based upon studies performed between 1964 and 2007, the point prevalence of hand eczema is approximately 4 percent; the one-year prevalence and the lifetime prevalence are approximately 10 and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cohort studies of adolescents and young adults followed-up for approximately 15 years estimated an incidence of hand eczema of approximately 9 to 12 per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Hand eczema is also the most common occupational skin disease. The incidence of occupational hand dermatitis has been estimated between 0.7 and 1.5 cases per 1000 workers per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Incidence is highest among workers performing &quot;wet work&quot; (eg, healthcare workers, food handlers, hairdressers). A Danish study of healthcare workers found a one-year prevalence of hand eczema of 21 percent and a lifetime prevalence of 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A similar study of Hong Kong nurses found a prevalence rate of 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a study of hand eczema in hairdressers, active disease was reported by 38 percent of current hairdressers and by 48 percent of former hairdressers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Because these numbers represent only the cases reported, they are likely an underestimate of the true prevalence. Studies have shown that occupational hand dermatitis is often underreported. In one study involving over 2000 hairdressers with chronic hand eczema, only 21 percent had reported their hand eczema as occupational to the workers&rsquo; compensation authority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A similar study of healthcare workers found that only 12 percent reported their hand eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506386531\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of hand eczema is multifactorial and involves both genetic and environmental factors. There is an association between the susceptibility to hand eczema and loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (<em>FLG</em>), which is important for the integrity of the epidermal barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Filaggrin is involved in terminal differentiation of the skin with appropriate keratin filament alignment and stratum corneum hydration. Loss-of-function filaggrin polymorphisms predispose to xerosis, ichthyosis vulgaris, and atopic eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidermal barrier'</a>.)</p><p>Repetitive wet work exposure is recognized as a predisposing factor for hand eczema. Water exposure for more than three hours per day can induce physiological changes in the normal skin and increase the susceptibility to skin irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Studies of occupational hand eczema have found an association with hand-washing practices and prolonged duration of exposure to liquids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As an example, unprotected wet work for more than two hours a day in hairdressers has been shown to be a significant risk factor for the development of hand eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Irritants often play an important role in both the development and persistence of hand eczema. In addition to water, important irritants include detergents, fragrances, and preservatives in hand soaps; harsh chemicals found in common household and industrial cleaners such as ammonia and solvents; raw fruits, vegetables, spices, and plants; and physical irritants (eg, metal tools, wood, fiberglass, <span class=\"nowrap\">dust/soil)</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irritant contact dermatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hand eczema may also be a manifestation of allergic contact dermatitis, a specific T cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Contact sensitization has been reported in 40 to 60 percent of patients with hand eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic or recurrent hand eczema is also the most frequent clinical manifestation of contact <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/protein</span> contact dermatitis <span class=\"nowrap\">(CU/PCD),</span> a distinct type of dermatitis induced by a type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction to high-molecular-weight allergens, such as animal or plant proteins in previously sensitized individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">CU/PCD</span> occurs predominantly in food handlers, cooks, veterinarians, or farmers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CU/PCD</span> usually have a positive prick test or specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) to certain foods but negative patch tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The reaction usually starts as an urticarial allergic response, but, with repeated episodes over time, the clinical appearance is that of chronic eczema.</p><p>Frequent relapses of acute palmoplantar eczema (dyshidrotic eczema) may also result in chronic hand dermatitis lichenified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-palmoplantar-eczema-dyshidrotic-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute palmoplantar eczema (dyshidrotic eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506386537\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the acute stage, hand eczema typically presents with erythema, edema, weeping, and vesiculation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F95749\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95749 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82993\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82993 \">picture 2</a>).

In the acute stage, a classic spongiotic reaction pattern is seen, including intercellular edema, microvesicle formation, and a superficial dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes, with or without eosinophils. As the dermatosis progresses to the chronic stage, the degree of spongiosis is often mild and epidermal acanthosis, parakeratosis, and hyperkeratosis predominate, with a superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506386549\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of chronic hand eczema is based upon a detailed history, physical examination, and patch testing. A skin biopsy may be necessary to exclude other dermatoses involving the hands that may mimic chronic hand eczema. (See <a href=\"#H506386555\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12329033\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed personal, occupational, and recreational history, focused on exposure to irritants and allergens, should be obtained from all patients presenting with hand eczema. Patients should be questioned about the type of work or hobbies, potential exposures to irritants or allergens, duration and frequency of exposure, and type of personal protective equipment. </p><p>An important element of history is a personal or family history of atopy such as asthma, hay fever, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, or childhood eczema. The results of previous allergy testing, including patch testing, prick testing, and radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) should also be recorded. </p><p>Precise information regarding the onset of dermatitis, duration, associated symptoms (burning, itching, stinging, swelling), and relieving factors should be obtained. In occupational cases, patients may have a clear history of improvement on weekends and time off work. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12329039\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When examining the patient&rsquo;s hands, the clinician should assess the extent of hand involvement and whether the skin changes extend to the wrist, the finger webs are involved, and the nails are normal or abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, a complete skin examination should be performed, looking for skin changes in other body areas that may be related to the hand disorder (eg, flexural dermatitis suggesting atopic dermatitis, erythematous plaques surmounted by silvery white scales suggesting psoriasis). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12329045\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patch testing should be considered to identify a possible relevant allergen, as it is often impossible to determine if there is an allergic component by history and exam alone. Common allergens associated with hand dermatitis are preservatives, fragrances, metals (eg, nickel, cobalt), rubber, and topical antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>). <span class=\"nowrap\">Prick/puncture</span> skin testing and determination of serum food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are indicated in patients with suspected contact <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/protein</span> contact dermatitis <span class=\"nowrap\">(CU/PCD)</span>.

They include the hand eczema severity index (HECSI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], the Clinical Photo Guide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and several instruments measuring the health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases, such as the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The PGA involves the evaluation of the intensity of the skin changes and the extent of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild eczema is defined by the presence of two or more mild skin changes (erythema, scaling, hyperkeratosis, lichenification, vesiculation, edema, fissures, pruritus, and pain) involving &lt;10 percent of the hand surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate eczema is defined by the presence of two or more mild to moderate skin changes (erythema, scaling, hyperkeratosis, lichenification, vesiculation, edema, fissures, pruritus, and pain) involving 10 to 30 percent of the hand surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe eczema is defined by the presence of two or more moderate to severe skin changes (erythema, scaling, hyperkeratosis, lichenification, vesiculation, edema, fissures, pruritus, and pain) involving &gt;30 percent of the hand surface.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506386555\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for hand eczema includes: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palmoplantar plaque psoriasis</strong> &ndash; Palmoplantar psoriasis presents with thick, scaly papules or plaques on an erythematous base.

Physical irritants include metal tools, wood, fiberglass, plant parts, paper, and dust or soil. Common sources of allergens include soaps and detergents, foods, industrial solvents and oils, cement, metals, topical medications, gloves, and cosmetics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults#H26143646\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irritant contact dermatitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Common irritants'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common allergens in allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Harsh soaps should be avoided and handwashing habits modified. Patients should wash with lukewarm water using a mild unscented and fragrance-free bar soap or a liquid non-soap (synthetic) detergent. Drying should be a gentle pat dry with attention to removing excess moisture from the interdigital spaces.</p><p>Hand washing and drying should be followed immediately by the application of a generous amount of heavy hand cream or ointment such as petroleum jelly. Excessive or habitual hand washing should be discouraged. Overuse of soap and water can prevent the restoration of the epidermal barrier and healing of hand eczema. If the hands are not visibly soiled, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be substituted to minimize overexposure to soap and wet-to-dry cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12329398\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of personal protective equipment is also paramount in the management of hand eczema. Gloves should be worn during cooking, gardening, and cleaning to minimize exposure to irritants such as raw meat, vegetables, and chemicals. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2667732801\"><span class=\"h4\">Gloves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vinyl or other nonlatex gloves are suitable for many routine exposures. Vinyl gloves are generally preferred to latex or rubber gloves due to the lesser presence of potential allergens. When protective gloves are to be used for intervals longer than 10 minutes, a thin cotton glove should be worn underneath. This will provide an absorbent layer and prevent sweat from irritating the skin with longer glove use. The cotton gloves can be washed and reused. </p><p>For occupational exposures, environmental hazards need to be considered when making the choice for protective glove recommendations. The patient should be encouraged to discuss appropriate protective equipment with their employer. The material safety and data sheet (MSDS) for a given chemical can be helpful and may list appropriate glove guidelines. </p><p>Certain materials readily penetrate various glove types, and not all gloves are suitable for all tasks. For example, acrylates that may be utilized in dentistry and orthopedics can easily penetrate many rubber and vinyl gloves. Therefore, if an individual is allergic to acrylates, a foil-type 4H chemical-resistant glove may be required under vinyl or rubber gloves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It is also important that protective gloves be intact without holes, clean and dry on the inside, and the appropriate size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2336016372\"><span class=\"h4\">Barrier creams</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moisturizers and skin barrier repair creams are also important to the management strategy of hand eczema. In healthy skin, the normal epidermal barrier is the stratum corneum, which is primarily composed of protein-rich cells and intercellular lipids. Moisturizers work to improve the quality of this barrier by use of humectants and emollients. Humectants include ingredients such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a>, topical urea, and pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA). The primary function of humectants is to attract water and hydrate the stratum corneum. Emollients smooth the dry flaking skin and also provide some occlusion to prevent water loss. Petrolatum, dimethicone, and waxes are common emollient ingredients. </p><p>Skin barrier repair creams work to mimic the intercellular lipids, which are composed of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. Studies have shown that appropriate use of moisturizers and skin barrier repair creams can significantly increase the disease-free time interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>Barrier creams (also known as protectant creams) are applied at least twice a day on all exposed skin areas and are formulated to be either water-repellent or oil-repellent. The goal is to limit penetration of hazardous chemicals into the epidermis. While these creams are minimally effective and cannot be used to replace gloves and other personal-protective equipment, they may be utilized to augment protection against low-grade irritants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-hand-eczema/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Examples of water-repellent barrier-protectant creams include North 201, SBS-44, and Kerodex 71. Oil- or solvent-protectant creams include North 222, SBS-46, and Kerodex 51. Dermashield and Tetrix are marketed as barrier-protectant creams with protection against both oil- and water-based irritants and sensitizers. A drawback of these products, however, is the possibility that they contain allergens which may exacerbate eczema in sensitive individuals. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12329411\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with mild to moderate disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest high potency or super high potency topical corticosteroids (groups 1 to 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate hand eczema. Topical corticosteroids can be applied once or twice a day for two to four weeks or until a stable improvement is achieved. Emollients should be applied liberally multiple times per day.</p><p>After induction of remission, we suggest maintenance intermittent therapy with a super high potency or high potency topical corticosteroid two to three times per week (eg, every other day, or during weekends) to prevent relapses. Intermittent therapy can be continued for several months. Relapses are treated resuming daily use of topical corticosteroids. However, long-term use of topical corticosteroids, especially high or super high potency preparations may induce skin atrophy, especially on the thinner skin of the dorsal hand. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although topical corticosteroids are widely used as a first-line therapy for hand eczema, data from randomized trials supporting their use are limited.

The dose may be tapered and discontinued over the following two weeks. Treatment with superpotent topical corticosteroids can be resumed as oral corticosteroids are tapered off. </p><p>There are no randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of oral corticosteroids for severe hand eczema.
