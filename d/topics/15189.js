Serial measurements are routinely obtained to detect early disease recurrence in men who have received definitive treatment for localized disease. </p><p>Monitoring serum PSA after treatment of localized prostate cancer frequently leads to the identification of men with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence. Such recurrences generally are identified before there are signs or symptoms of either locoregional recurrence or distant metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Follow-up surveillance during and after treatment for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rationale and role of diagnostic studies in patients with a rising serum PSA after definitive treatment for prostate cancer is discussed here.

Additional aggressive local therapy may result in prolonged disease-free survival if the recurrent disease is localized. </p><p>However, the prolonged natural history of prostate cancer, and the relatively advanced age and comorbidity often present in men with prostate cancer make the role of further treatment uncertain in many cases. Once a biochemical recurrence is diagnosed, potential approaches include salvage local treatment, systemic therapy, and observation, depending upon the site and extent of recurrent disease. Even if the site of recurrence cannot be identified, there may be a prolonged period after the documentation of a PSA recurrence before there is any clinical evidence of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H81453304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'Natural history after biochemical failure'</a>.)</p><p>Following radical prostatectomy, important predictive factors in men with a biochemical recurrence are PSA kinetics, including time to measurable PSA and PSA doubling time. In addition to the PSA parameters, pathologic findings at surgery (primary tumor [T] stage, nodal and margin status, Gleason score) are also significant prognostic factors.</p><p>Consideration of these parameters can optimize patient selection for salvage local therapy by eliminating those men who are at exceptionally high risk of systemic recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H81453304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'Natural history after biochemical failure'</a>.)</p><p>Management of these patients may require imaging studies to rule out bone metastases or extensive pelvic disease. Tissue documentation of recurrent disease should also be obtained, if clinically indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency with which unsuspected metastases are detected using imaging studies is very low for men with an early PSA-only progression if the patient has not had prior androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Thus, imaging studies are often restricted to those at high risk for recurrence.</p><p>Osteoblastic axial skeleton metastases are the primary site for widely disseminated disease, and the pelvis is the site for locoregional recurrence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81456181\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technetium 99 radionuclide bone scan historically has been the most used imaging procedure for the diagnosis of bone metastases and remains the standard of care, although it has limited sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, unsuspected bone metastases are only rarely detected in patients undergoing an initial evaluation for an elevated PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>In contemporary practice, the serum PSA is monitored after initial treatment. A diagnosis of biochemical recurrence is typically made when the PSA is &ge;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> after radical prostatectomy and using the Phoenix criteria after radiation therapy (RT; ie, nadir plus 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. Thus, imaging evaluation is probably unnecessary unless there are symptoms referable to bone or the PSA is greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.</p><p>The limited yield from routine bone scan is illustrated by a series of 239 patients in whom 414 bone scans were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The frequency with which positive bone scans were identified increased progressively with the level of serum PSA. For patients with a PSA &lt;10, 10 to 20, 20 to 50, and &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> the frequencies of positive bone scans were 4, 36, 50, and 79 percent, respectively. It should be noted that metastases in this study were identified based on a single bone scan without confirmation by corroborative or serial imaging, or confirmatory biopsy. The true metastasis rates may differ based on other factors, such as PSA doubling time, within these PSA cohorts.</p><p>In patients in whom salvage therapy is being considered, imaging is useful to exclude spread beyond the prostate. The decision of whether to perform bone imaging should incorporate a consideration of the time to PSA relapse and PSA kinetics, as well as the morbidity associated with potential salvage therapy (ie, salvage RT after radical prostatectomy versus salvage radical prostatectomy after RT). Men who have a positive or equivocal bone scan are usually evaluated by targeted plain radiographs, or with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or biopsy if radiographic findings are inconclusive. </p><p>Newer imaging techniques using positron emission tomography (PET) or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/computed</span> tomography (CT) are under development and appear to offer improved sensitivity and specificity compared with technetium 99 radionuclide bone scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. With more studies and a reduction in the false-positive rate, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging with newer isotopes may become a preferred alternative. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'PET'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81456251\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvis and prostate bed</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensitivity of CT to detect a pelvic recurrence appears to be limited in the setting of PSA-only recurrence unless the PSA value is relatively high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. We do not recommend CT unless the serum PSA level is &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or the rate of PSA rise is &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> per year.</p><p>This was illustrated by a study in 86 men who had undergone prostatectomy, in which CT was informative in only 12 (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The mean PSA value was significantly higher in those with a positive scan (27.4 versus 4.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> as was the mean PSA velocity (1.8 versus 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> per month). Only eight scans (9 percent) provided new information to the clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of MRI in evaluating men with a biochemical recurrence has not been established, but a number of institutions are rigorously exploring the use of MRI both for diagnostic and treatment planning purposes in this setting. Further research is needed to establish whether this test is useful to localize prostate cancer recurrences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In men with biochemical recurrence following initial RT, MRI has been used to identify seminal vesicle invasion or extraprostatic extension in those who are being considered for salvage prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The presence of these features (particularly seminal vesicle invasion) identifies men who are unlikely to achieve long-term disease control.

The largest series included 45 consecutive men who underwent salvage radical prostatectomy for biopsy-proven, locally recurrent prostate cancer over a six-year period, all of whom underwent endorectal coil MRI prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. All scans were read independently by two experienced radiologists. There was significant variation between readers, with sensitivity for seminal vesicle involvement of 38 and 62 percent, respectively. </p><p>In addition, MRI may complement the treatment planning process by delineating the prostatic bed or localizing a small focus of locally recurrent diseases in men undergoing salvage RT after radical prostatectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">PET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scanning in men with suspected recurrent prostate cancer is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Some early reports concluded that PET is of limited utility overall, particularly for men with a low serum PSA or PSA velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In contrast, others suggest that PET is useful in imaging local recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], osseous metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], or nodal and soft tissue lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/14,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,18</a>].</p><p>FDG is excreted by the kidneys and accumulates in the bladder. This creates a major problem when the goal is to image the prostatic bed and pelvis. Early studies suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluciclovine-f-18-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluciclovine F-18</a>, 18-fluorine-labeled choline, 18-F sodium fluoride, and 11-carbon-labeled acetate may be better tracers for use in recurrent prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. PET and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> with these tracers is still considered investigational in men with a PSA-only recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluciclovine-f-18-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluciclovine F-18</a> has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PET imaging in men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence based upon elevated PSA levels after prior treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There is minimal excretion from the kidneys, so fluciclovine F-18 may be more accurate than FDG at imaging the prostate bed. However, false-positive scans remain a significant concern with <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging, and there is a steep learning curve associated with interpretation of this approach. </p><p>In a study of 143 patients with a PSA-only recurrence who were imaged using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluciclovine-f-18-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluciclovine F-18</a>, the positive predictive value was 82 percent, and the negative predictive value was 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Biopsy documentation of a local recurrence should be obtained before proceeding with radical prostatectomy or other local treatment following RT for a PSA recurrence. This is important because recurrent disease in the prostate must be distinguished from benign prostatic hypertrophy in the residual prostate gland. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Salvage local therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most of these men will be identified by an isolated progressive rise in serum PSA above the nadir value. However, defining PSA failures after RT for localized prostate cancer is difficult. Depending upon the definition that is used, identification of treatment failure may be delayed, sometimes by months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'After radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Prostate biopsy may provide useful information to aid in the early diagnosis of a local recurrence in men with a rising PSA following RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, there are important caveats to its use. The histologic regression of tumor cells after RT may be prolonged; a positive result less than two years after treatment does not correlate well with disease progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of prostate biopsy&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>For men with a biochemical recurrence, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), usually accompanied by biopsy, may have a role in localizing the site of recurrence and guiding secondary treatment decisions. The positive predictive value of TRUS in this setting ranges from 50 to 95 percent in various studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. However, the true sensitivity of TRUS-guided biopsy cannot be assessed since there is no &quot;gold standard&quot; by which to determine the false-negative rate with biopsies. </p><p>An American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) consensus panel recommended that routine prostate biopsy for evaluation of PSA recurrence after RT not be performed unless salvage prostatectomy or another local salvage procedure was being considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In this setting, TRUS-guided biopsy is indicated for histologic confirmation of a suspected isolated local recurrence prior to salvage therapy.
