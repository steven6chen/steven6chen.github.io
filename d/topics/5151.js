This topic will review the diagnostic approach and management of pregnant women presenting with new hyperandrogenism. The major causes and clinical features of gestational hyperandrogenism are discussed in detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59214\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59214 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 2</a>).

The fetal risk depends on a number of factors including the timing of the excess maternal androgen production, the magnitude and type of androgen increase, and the condition(s) causing the increase.</p><p>The possibility of androgen excess usually arises when a pregnant woman presents with the rapid onset of masculinization (virilization). Affected women may have a variety of symptoms including hirsutism (at times requiring shaving), acne, temporal balding, clitoromegaly, and deepening of the voice.</p><p>There may also be a palpable abdominal mass due to a tumor or cyst. Causes of the masses include luteomas, theca-lutein cysts, other ovarian tumors, and adrenal tumors. No masses would be expected when the etiology is exposure to exogenous hormones or placental aromatase deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical features of gestational hyperandrogenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At other times, gestational hyperandrogenism is first suspected at the time of delivery of a virilized female infant. If the investigation begins after delivery, one must keep in mind that luteomas and theca-lutein cysts undergo spontaneous regression after delivery, ie, maternal surgical intervention is not required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical features of gestational hyperandrogenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2133818689\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating a woman with gestational hyperandrogenism, the goals are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine the potential risk of virilization of a female fetus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguish between benign and malignant causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid unnecessary ovarian surgery &ndash; Both luteomas and theca-lutein cysts regress after delivery, so surgery should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2624416072\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of fetal virilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When seeing the mother during pregnancy, the time of onset of hirsutism and virilization should be determined and information about exogenous androgen exposure should be obtained. Female external genital development occurs between <strong>7 and 12 weeks</strong> of gestation; androgen exposure during early pregnancy, therefore, may result in partial or complete labial fusion and clitoral hypertrophy. After the 12<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, androgen exposure causes only clitoral hypertrophy. Male fetuses are not affected.</p><p>A number of disorders during pregnancy cause an increase in maternal androgen production that can cause virilization in both the woman and her fetus. As noted, the risk to the fetus depends on a number of factors, including the onset of increased maternal androgen production, the magnitude and type of androgen increase, and the condition causing the increase. For example, fetal virilization is common in virilized pregnant women with luteomas but extremely rare in those with theca-lutein cysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1075321026\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormone determinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal pregnancy is characterized by a progressive increase in serum total testosterone concentrations, due primarily to an increase in serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations, and a late increase in serum free testosterone and androstenedione concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F96762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96762 \">table 3</a>). However, normal women do not experience symptoms or signs of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism) as a result of this physiologic rise in androgen concentrations.</p><p>Women who present with acute onset of hyperandrogenism in pregnancy require a pelvic ultrasound to define ovarian size and architecture, to exclude an ovarian tumor or cyst, and to look for gestational trophoblast disease. We also measure serum testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Some experts also measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).</p><p>While serum androgen concentrations help distinguish between benign and malignant causes of androgen excess in nonpregnant women, the utility of these measurements is less certain in pregnant women with hyperandrogenism. If a solid mass or masses are seen on ultrasound, serum inhibin A (a tumor marker for Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors) and CA-125 should also be measured. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Virilizing ovarian tumors'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with pregnancy luteomas, extreme elevations in testosterone concentrations have been described (11,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> in one case report), with normalization (22 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL)</span> by three weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Fetal virilization is indicative of high maternal serum androgen concentrations. However, not all women with high serum androgen concentrations deliver infants that are virilized. As an example, fetal virilization is not expected with theca-lutein cysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66532 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-features-of-gestational-hyperandrogenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical features of gestational hyperandrogenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High umbilical cord serum concentrations of testosterone and androstenedione (based upon four cases) appear to be necessary for virilization of a female infant. Umbilical blood sampling for testosterone, androstenedione and karyotyping could potentially provide useful prognostic information in women with suspected luteomas if it could be done early enough in gestation. However, this procedure is not generally performed until 20 weeks gestation, after the time at which virilization would have occurred. We therefore do <strong>not</strong> suggest umbilical cord sampling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic ultrasonography should be performed in women with the acute onset of hirsutism or virilization, or worsening of preexisting hirsutism during pregnancy. Ultrasonography is helpful in distinguishing solid and cystic ovarian tumors and unilateral from bilateral ovarian disease.

Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), circulating fetal DNA can be used as a source of genetic material for noninvasive prenatal evaluation. This technique has been used to determine fetal sex; the finding of a male fetus eliminates concern about potential fetal virilization.

Female external genital development occurs between 7 and 12 weeks of gestation; androgen exposure during this period may result in partial or complete labial fusion and clitoral hypertrophy. After the 12<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, clitoral hypertrophy remains a risk, but labial fusion does not occur. Male fetuses are not affected. (See <a href=\"#H2624416072\" class=\"local\">'Risk of fetal virilization'</a> above.)</p><p>In the past, there were cases of fetal virilization after exposure to very high doses of progestins, most notably, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> (40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> which was used early in pregnancy to prevent miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>]. However, exposure to progestins is no longer considered to be a risk for fetal virilization, as high progestin doses are no longer used. For example, the dose of norethindrone in a standard oral estrogen-progestin contraceptive is typically 1 mg, and androgen-associated adverse effects have not been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Placental aromatase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aromatase expression in the placenta protects the mother from the potentially androgenizing effects of fetal adrenal androgens during pregnancy. Aromatase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the CYP19A1 gene. Pregnant women who have placental aromatase deficiency are unable to produce estradiol from their androgen precursors, which come from the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-gestational-hyperandrogenism/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Maternal virilization would be expected to regress in the postpartum period in women with placental aromatase deficiency.
