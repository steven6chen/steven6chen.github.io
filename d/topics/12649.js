Each year in the United States approximately 2500 to 3500 new cases of ALL are diagnosed in children. ALL incidence is slightly higher in Whites (36 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million)</span> and Hispanics (41 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million)</span> than in Black Americans (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Survival rates for ALL have improved dramatically since the 1980s, with a current five-year overall survival rate estimated at greater than 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. This improvement is in large part because of treatment of large numbers of children with sequential collaborative standardized research protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Approximately 75 to 80 percent of children with newly diagnosed ALL participate in clinical research trials, the goals of which are to improve clinical outcome and to minimize acute toxicities and late-occurring adverse events.</p><p>The presentation and diagnosis of ALL in children are reviewed here. The risk group stratification and treatment of childhood ALL are discussed separately.

The incidence of pediatric leukemia varies worldwide but this may be influenced, in part, by diagnostic and reporting differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. ALL incidence is slightly higher in Whites (36 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million)</span> and Hispanics (41 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million)</span> than in Black Americans (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>It appears the incidence of childhood leukemia is increasing as demonstrated by the two following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, there was a steady increase in ALL incidence from 1975 to 2010 with an average annual increase in incidence of approximately 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The estimated incidence increased from 25 cases per million in 1975 to 34 cases per million in 2010.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that used data from 63 European population-based cancer registries of children diagnosed with cancer, the incidence of leukemia including ALL increased by an average of 1.4 percent from 1970 to 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from Great Britain, the incidence of leukemia (mostly attributable to ALL) has steadily increased from 3.83 to 4.61 per 100,000 persons by sex and age from the five-year period of 1971 to 1975 and 1996 to 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>In contrast, a study from four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) reported that the incidence of childhood ALL remained stable at an approximate rate of 3.3 cases per 100,000 children below 15 years of age from 1983 to 2002 after an increase in incidence between 1975 and 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The peak incidence occurs between two and five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>], and it occurs more commonly among boys than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. The vast majority of ALL cases are not associated with genetic or environmental risk factors. However, certain genetic and immunodeficiency syndromes (eg, Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, Bloom syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia) place children at higher risk for ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. An increased risk of ALL associated with higher birth weight has also been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Studies of the relationship between childhood ALL, <span class=\"nowrap\">urban/rural</span> status and population density, as well as other possible etiologic factors (eg, environmental exposures, abnormal immune response to common infection[s]) have yielded inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-27</a>]. </p><p>Genomic studies have noted that somatic, polymorphic variants of ARD5B, IKZF1 (the gene encoding Ikaros) and CDKN2A are associated with an increased risk of ALL (odds ratio 1.3 to 1.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Other rare germline mutations in PAX5, ETV6, and particularly p53 can also strongly predispose to the development of leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, in most cases, childhood ALL is not considered to be a familial disease. A Scandinavian study that included 3994 children with ALL identified 36 siblings who were subsequently diagnosed with ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. They found that, compared with the general population, twin siblings of children with ALL are at markedly increased risk of developing leukemia (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 163; 95% CI 70-320), while singleton siblings are at only slightly increased risk (SIR 3; 95% CI 2-6). Importantly, ALL is a disease with a low incidence in the general population (41 cases per 1 million in children ages 0 to 14 years); as a result, even a large increase in the relative risk among siblings does not translate into a high likelihood of developing leukemia. With the current available information, we do not recommend a screening program for siblings of patients with leukemia. Screening of patients for familial leukemia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common presenting symptoms of ALL are nonspecific and may be difficult to distinguish from common, self-limited diseases of childhood. In a meta-analysis, more than half of children with childhood leukemia had at least one of the following five features on presentation: palpable liver, palpable spleen, pallor, fever, or bruising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Unexplained persistence of any of these common signs or symptoms should prompt consideration of malignancy as a possible cause. The characteristics of common presenting signs or symptoms of leukemia that are suggestive of malignancy are discussed briefly below and in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of the child with suspected cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1997523152\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatosplenomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatomegaly (64 percent) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenomegaly (61 percent) are the most common clinical findings in association with childhood leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These abnormalities may also manifest as symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, abdominal distension or abdominal pain, or an abdominal mass noted by a family member or clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H357785447\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly half of children with ALL present with lymphadenopathy, which is one of the indications of extramedullary leukemic spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As a general rule, a lymph node is considered enlarged if it is &gt;10 mm in its greatest diameter. Exceptions to this rule include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epitrochlear nodes are enlarged if they are &gt;5 mm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inguinal nodes are enlarged if they are &gt;15 mm in greatest diameter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical nodes are enlarged if they are &gt;20 mm.</p><p/><p>Lymphadenopathy associated with malignancy usually is nontender, firm, rubbery, and matted. Persistent or progressive lymphadenopathy that does not respond to antibiotic therapy suggests the need for more extensive evaluation.

Early bone marrow examination should be considered in any child who has persistent bone pain and peripheral blood abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Bone pain, particularly affecting the long bones, and caused by leukemic involvement of the periosteum, is a presenting symptom in 21 to 38 percent of cases of acute leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. Bone pain also results from aseptic osteonecrosis because of malignant cell necrosis in the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

Rarely, leukemia can present with cranial nerve abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Testicular enlargement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rare, painless unilateral testicular enlargement can be a presenting sign of ALL. Any persistent, painless, solid testicular mass should be referred for biopsy by a pediatric surgeon after evaluation by ultrasound. When testicular leukemia is suspected, bilateral wedge biopsies are preferred to decrease sampling error. Histologic interpretation can be challenging and requires the ability to differentiate leukemic lymphoblasts from reactive lymphocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mediastinal mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescents with ALL may present with many of the features of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Distinguishing between these two disorders can sometimes be difficult. T cell ALL commonly occurs in older boys who present with high initial white blood cell (WBC) counts and a large mediastinal mass. Patients who present with features of lymphoma, such as mediastinal mass and lymphadenopathy, often have significant bone marrow involvement. Malignant lymphoblasts found in T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma are indistinguishable from T cell ALL; by convention, children having more extensive bone marrow involvement (&gt;25 percent in the United States) are classified as having leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A large anterior mediastinal mass can narrow the trachea, causing respiratory distress. Such masses can also be associated with pleural effusions, further compromising respiratory function. In addition, a mediastinal mass can obstruct the superior vena cava, resulting in superior vena cava syndrome, which is manifest as pain, dysphagia, dyspnea, or swelling of the neck, face, and upper limbs.

While some clinicians still use this system to describe the phenotype of the tumor cells, FAB morphology has lost its prognostic value as our understanding of disease biology has improved and treatment regimens have become more intense and successful. As such, FAB subtype is not currently used in either diagnosis or treatment decisions.

Approximately 10 percent of those with T cell ALL have a distinct immunophenotype (CD8-, CD5dim) and gene expression signature, consistent with an early T cell precursor phenotype (ETP ALL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Some B-precursor ALL cells, for example, express myeloid markers (ie, markers more typical of the granulocytic series) in addition to classic B-lymphocyte markers. Although this does not affect long-term prognosis or risk group assignment, it is one of the reasons why immunophenotyping should not be used as the sole means of leukemia classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12364614\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytogenetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromosomal abnormalities are common in childhood ALL.

This evaluation will include clinical examination, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, which will diagnose ALL and determine the leukemia phenotype as well as the presence or absence of cytogenetic abnormalities. Bone marrow aspirations are required if the patient is to be enrolled in a cooperative group trial. Bone marrow aspirations are also preferred for diagnostic accuracy and often provide better cytogenetics results. It is not standard in children or adolescents to diagnose leukemia from the peripheral blood when lymphoblasts are present. However, in cases where it is difficult to obtain either bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, peripheral blood can be substituted for bone marrow. This initial information will be used to assign the patient to a treatment group based upon risk stratification.
