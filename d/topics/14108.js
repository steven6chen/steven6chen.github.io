The 2010 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> thoracic aortic guidelines note that prophylactic aortic root or ascending aorta surgery may be considered if aortic dilatation is progressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there is progression of aortic regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-a-bicuspid-aortic-valve/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In that study, although the pregnancies were uncomplicated, the prevalence of aortic dissection and elective aortic surgery were higher in women after pregnancy than in a non-pregnant matched cohort. Pregnancy was associated with an increased aortic growth rate, which did not return to baseline after pregnancy. Comparable data are not available for women with a dilated aorta and a bicuspid aortic valve.

For asymptomatic young women with AS who want to become pregnant, PABV was considered reasonable if the peak-to-peak gradient on catheterization is greater than 50 mmHg and the valve is minimally calcified.

The choices are a bioprosthetic valve, a homograft valve, a pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure), and a mechanical valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-a-bicuspid-aortic-valve/abstract/13,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31</a>].

Although anticoagulation is not required for bioprosthetic valves in the absence of accompanying risk factors, there is a high rate of structural failure, which may exceed 60 percent at 15 years in younger patients.

Heparin does not cross the placenta but therapeutic levels are difficult to maintain with subcutaneous dosing, thus leading to an increased rate of valve thrombosis. Low-molecular weight heparin with regular monitoring of antifactor Xa levels may provide the best protection against valve thrombosis. However the efficacy of low molecular weight heparin in patients with mechanical valve prostheses has not been established.

Potential risks should be discussed including heritable congenital heart disease, aortic dissection (particularly if the ascending aortic diameter is &gt;45 mm), and complications of aortic stenosis (AS) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic regurgitation (AR). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with bicuspid aortic valve should undergo preconception transthoracic echocardiography to assess ascending aorta size. In addition, we recommend that patients with a bicuspid aortic valve undergo echocardiographic aortic imaging during pregnancy. If the aorta is dilated, we recommend monthly or bimonthly echocardiographic imaging during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Aortic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with bicuspid aortic valve who are planning pregnancy, we suggest pre-conception aortic root or ascending aorta surgery if the aortic diameter is &gt;45 mm, if the rate of increase is &ge;5 mm per year, or if there is progressive aortic regurgitation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Management of aortic dilatation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All pregnant women with bicuspid aortic valve and thoracic aortic dilatation should maintain strict blood pressure control to prevent Stage II hypertension.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Management of aortic dilatation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with symptomatic bicuspid AS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high-risk features (severe AS or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40 percent) should delay conception until the AS has been addressed. Potential options include percutaneous aortic valvotomy (if the valve is suitable) or aortic valve replacement.
