In the United States, there are approximately 13,000 cases and 3660 deaths due to laryngeal cancer annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Glottic, supraglottic, and subglottic cancers represent approximately two-thirds, one-third, and 2 percent of laryngeal cancers, respectively. Hypopharyngeal cancer is less common than laryngeal cancer, with approximately one-fourth as many cases. </p><p>Tumors of the glottic larynx commonly present with hoarseness and are most often diagnosed at an early stage. However, patients with supraglottic and subglottic laryngeal cancers, as well as hypopharyngeal cancers, usually present with advanced disease due to a paucity of symptoms, propensity for local extension (subglottis), and rich lymphatics resulting in a high incidence of lymph node metastases (supraglottis).</p><p>The management of locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer is presented here.

For laryngeal cancers, staging of the primary tumor (T) is defined separately for supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic tumors.

A multidisciplinary tumor board can potentially change management and improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>The treatment approach depends upon tumor extent and location, patient-specific factors (eg, age, performance status, comorbidity, psychosocial support), physician expertise, and the availability of rehabilitation services. Treatment-related toxicity associated with chemoradiotherapy and surgery must also be considered. Patient selection should consider a patient's ability to actively participate in speech and swallowing rehabilitation, regardless of treatment approach.</p><p>Functional organ preservation is widely recommended and generally utilizes a combination of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (RT). However, advances in surgical techniques, such as laryngeal preservation surgery and minimally invasive surgery, offer alternative options for larynx preservation in carefully selected patients. These surgical approaches have not been directly compared with chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H291853346\" class=\"local\">'Larynx preservation surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Although functional organ-sparing approaches (ie, chemoradiotherapy) can permit larynx preservation in patients with locoregionally advanced cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx, they do not provide a survival advantage over total laryngectomy. When feasible, most patients should be offered the option of organ preservation because of the possibility of natural speech and swallowing function of the larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Preservation of the larynx is not the exclusive determinant of quality of life; maintenance of speech, swallowing, and airway patency are critical endpoints of any functional organ-preservation treatment. An international consensus panel has recommended that a new endpoint of laryngoesophageal dysfunction-free survival is a more useful objective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Events in this endpoint include death, local relapse, total or partial laryngectomy, tracheotomy at two or more years, and the presence of a feeding tube at two or more years. Salvage of a dysfunctional larynx with inadequate airway (requiring a tracheotomy) or swallow function (requiring a feeding tube) may not serve the patient well.</p><p>In addition, patients should be counseled about smoking cessation; ongoing tobacco use during RT has been associated with reduced survival in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349830523\"><span class=\"h1\">COMBINED MODALITY THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most good performance status patients with potentially operable, locally advanced cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx, functional organ-preserving approaches using combinations of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) have replaced total laryngectomy plus postoperative RT. These approaches include chemotherapy given at the same time as RT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy), induction chemotherapy followed by RT alone, or sequential therapy with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. RT alone may also be considered an organ-preservation strategy for those who cannot tolerate chemoradiotherapy or sequential chemotherapy, although this approach is associated with lower larynx preservation and survival rates.

These combined modality approaches are also used to provide definitive treatment for patients who are inoperable because of extensive locoregional disease.</p><p>While combined RT plus chemotherapy approaches usually maintain laryngeal function in patients with resectable disease, they are associated with considerable toxicity that, in some cases, may compromise the airway (edema or stenosis) or the patient's ability to protect the airway, and thus, may not achieve the goal of functional larynx preservation. </p><p>Organ function-preserving chemoradiotherapy approaches are not appropriate for all patients with locoregionally advanced cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients and those with a poor performance status may not be suitable candidates for chemoradiotherapy approaches because of the upfront morbidity associated with this treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the inability to rehabilitate from these potentially life-threatening toxicities. Definitive RT alone for organ preservation or total laryngectomy followed by postoperative RT may be preferable in this setting. Laryngectomy typically offers rapid control of symptoms and prompt swallowing recovery.

Significant cartilage destruction prior to treatment may be an indication for initial laryngectomy because cartilage destruction limits the likelihood of adequate functional recovery with larynx-preserving approaches and increases the probability of radiation-induced necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the presence of cartilage invasion alone does not necessarily preclude an organ sparing approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].

This approach is more effective in achieving locoregional control of disease. However, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is less effective in preventing the development of distant metastases, compared with induction chemotherapy followed by definitive RT, and is associated with more unexplained deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H432436853\" class=\"local\">'Comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy approaches'</a> below.) </p><p>Data supporting the role of concurrent chemoradiotherapy come from the 2011 update of the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy on Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) Collaborative Group, which conducted a comprehensive analysis by tumor site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx-and-hypopharynx/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This analysis was based upon individual patient data for 3216 patients with laryngeal cancer. There was an overall benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to locoregional therapy (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.96); this survival advantage was exclusively restricted to concurrent chemoradiotherapy rather than induction or adjuvant delivery of systemic therapy.</p><p>In patients with laryngeal cancer, the survival benefit with concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus RT alone was particularly robust (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.90). However, very few of the induction studies included the PF regimen, and none incorporated the contemporary standard, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> plus PF (TPF). Furthermore, the data on induction chemotherapy from the largest trial (RTOG 91-11) were not included in the analysis, which is particularly relevant because the update of this trial suggested a non-significant trend favoring the induction chemotherapy group over concomitant chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy#H281027161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy&quot;, section on 'Concurrent chemotherapy'</a> and <a href=\"#H432436853\" class=\"local\">'Comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>For the 2767 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer, a similar benefit in survival with chemotherapy was observed (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.96). In contrast to larynx cancer, there was no statistically significant interaction between chemotherapy timing and survival as the benefit of chemotherapy was similar in those given concomitant chemoradiotherapy (HR 0.85) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.88). However, only the HR for concomitant chemotherapy was statistically significant in comparison to local therapy alone, although the analysis may not have had adequate power to detect a difference in this disease site.</p><p>Based upon these results, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is widely recommended for good performance status patients with resectable, locally advanced (stage III and carefully selected stage IV) laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer, with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> every three weeks).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349830665\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction chemotherapy followed by definitive RT is an alternative for the functional organ-preservation treatment of locally advanced cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx.

Sequential therapy may be particularly useful in patients with large primary tumors (bulky T3 and select T4) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> advanced nodal presentations (large N2a, N2b, N2c, and N3) who are at high-risk for distant metastases. (See <a href=\"#H349830523\" class=\"local\">'Combined modality therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial laryngectomy and minimally invasive surgery may be options for carefully selected patients, especially those with relatively small primary tumors combined with more extensive neck disease. Postoperative RT is generally required in these cases. (See <a href=\"#H349830915\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H291853361\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative radiation therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who may not be candidates for an organ-preservation approach include patients with resectable tumors that have destroyed both vocal cords, elderly patients for whom the toxicity associated with chemoradiotherapy or full dose RT alone is problematic, and those with extensive cartilage destruction from the primary tumor. (See <a href=\"#H349830501\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H349830938\" class=\"local\">'Total laryngectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H291853368\" class=\"local\">'Older and poor performance status patients'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of the neck is complex and depends upon disease extent, treatment modality used to treat the primary tumor, and response to therapy.

Definitive RT alone may be used as a functional organ-preserving approach for laryngeal cancer patients who are not felt to be candidates for chemotherapy, although there is a higher risk of recurrence and, thus, a need for salvage laryngectomy. (See <a href=\"#H349830938\" class=\"local\">'Total laryngectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H291853368\" class=\"local\">'Older and poor performance status patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate posttreatment surveillance and long-term follow-up are crucial to ensure adequate voice and swallowing rehabilitation, and to monitor for disease recurrence or a second primary malignancy. Lifelong follow-up is also necessary to ensure that late complications of treatment are addressed to mitigate the risk of non-cancer causes of mortality.
