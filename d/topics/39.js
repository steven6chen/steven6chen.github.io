Through the ablation of the epidermis and portions of the superficial dermis as well as the induction of collagen remodeling in the deeper dermis, ablative laser resurfacing can reduce rhytides (wrinkles), dyschromia, vascular changes, and skin laxity.</p><p>The mechanism of action, efficacy, adverse effects, and administration of traditional and fractional ablative laser resurfacing for skin rejuvenation will be discussed here. The basic principles of laser therapy for cutaneous lesions are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8009623\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technology for ablative laser resurfacing has continuously evolved. The procedure was first performed in the 1980s with the continuous wave carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser. Use of this laser was complicated by an unfavorably high risk of adverse effects, and the subsequent development of pulsed CO<sub>2</sub> lasers and rapidly scanning continuous wave CO<sub>2</sub> lasers improved the safety of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the 1990s the erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser was introduced as an alternative device for ablative laser resurfacing. Advantages of Er:YAG lasers included more precise control over the depth of cutaneous ablation and a lower incidence of adverse effects. </p><p>For a number of years, the CO<sub>2</sub> and Er:YAG lasers were the primary lasers used for ablative laser resurfacing for skin rejuvenation, with CO<sub>2</sub> lasers considered the gold standard for this indication. However, in the early 2000s, the approach to laser skin rejuvenation was dramatically altered by the development of fractional lasers, which emit numerous narrow, microscopic columns of laser light. Fractional lasers treat only a defined fraction of the skin within a targeted area, leaving intervening areas of skin unaffected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53757 \">figure 1</a>). The reservoir of undamaged skin adjacent to sites of laser injury allows for rapid reepithelialization after treatment through the migration of viable cells into wounded areas.</p><p>Aside from the repair of photodamaged skin, ablative laser resurfacing is used for a variety of other indications, such as the treatment of scars, actinic keratoses, epidermal nevi, and other cutaneous lesions and disorders. Nonablative traditional and fractional lasers also have been studied for facial rejuvenation; however, these lasers generally are less efficacious than their ablative counterparts for this indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18975495\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92421460\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selection of the appropriate patient is of critical importance in ablative laser resurfacing. The patient should be thoroughly informed of the expected treatment outcome, anticipated recovery period, and treatment risks. In most cases, treatment results in mild to moderate improvements in cutaneous signs of photoaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81643\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81643 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>The length of time required for healing after ablative laser resurfacing is a deterrent for some patients. The expected convalescent period after traditional CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing is around two weeks and is followed by several weeks to several months of persistent facial erythema. Shorter recovery periods are associated with resurfacing with traditional Er:YAG lasers and fractional lasers. Reepithelialization after traditional Er:YAG laser resurfacing is usually complete after three to eight days and postoperative erythema resolves more quickly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Patients treated with the fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser can usually return to normal activity after 5 to 10 days, depending on the intensity of treatment; less time is needed for recovery after fractional Er:YAG resurfacing. </p><p>The specific concerns of the patient and the clinical features contributing to an aged appearance should be assessed carefully by the clinician to ensure that treatment is likely to achieve the desired result. Although laser resurfacing can lead to improvements in rhytides such as those in the periorbital, cheek, and periocular areas, deep nasolabial creases, marionette lines, and severe skin laxity are often best managed with interventions such as injectable cosmetic fillers and surgery. Dynamic rhytides (wrinkles exacerbated by facial muscle movement) may recur within months after successful ablative laser therapy. Patients with dynamic rhytides may benefit from the use of botulinum toxin before and after laser resurfacing to delay the recurrence of rhytides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications#H4081882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of botulinum toxin for cosmetic indications&quot;, section on 'Use as adjunctive therapy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92421453\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The paucity of high quality data on the efficacy of both traditional and fractional ablative lasers in facial rejuvenation makes evidence-based practice challenging. The available data are primarily limited to uncontrolled studies and a few small randomized trials. In addition, systematic interpretation of the published literature is compromised by wide variation in criteria used to assess treatment responses and clinically significant differences among devices within the same laser class. The differences among brands of ablative lasers also make standardization of treatment regimens impossible.</p><p>The relative efficacy of traditional and fractional ablative lasers remains uncertain, and the choice of procedure is heavily influenced by patient-specific factors, laser availability, and clinician expertise. The traditional CO<sub>2</sub> laser appears to have a greater effect on dermal collagen remodeling than traditional Er:YAG lasers; this effect clinically manifests as favorable tightening of lax skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. However, due to a relatively high risk of adverse effects (eg, scarring, dyspigmentation, and prolonged erythema) and a recovery period that exceeds that associated with fractional lasers, use of the CO<sub>2</sub> laser has become less popular with the advent of new therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The traditional Er:YAG laser requires more laser passes (retreatment of the same area during a single treatment session) than traditional CO<sub>2</sub> lasers to achieve a similar depth of ablation. The more precise skin ablation feasible with the Er:YAG laser is desired in some clinical settings, but may also contribute to reduced thermal damage to underlying collagen resulting in a lesser skin tightening effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. The traditional Er:YAG has been favored by some clinicians for the treatment of dyschromia and fine wrinkling associated with photodamage rather than for the treatment of coarse, deep rhytides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The Er:YAG also appears to have a lower risk for scarring than the CO<sub>2 </sub>laser and may be beneficial for the treatment of areas at greater risk for laser-induced scar formation, such as delicate periorbital skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Like traditional ablative lasers, fractional ablative lasers improve dyschromia and rhytides associated with cutaneous photodamage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although comparative trials are lacking, some authors have suggested that the efficacy of fractional ablative lasers for skin tightening may exceed that of traditional ablative lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This assertion plus the relatively short recovery period and reduced risk for adverse effects associated with fractional ablative lasers have contributed to a near total shift away from traditional lasers to fractional lasers as the preferred devices for ablative laser resurfacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Additional high quality studies are necessary to clarify the role of fractional ablative lasers in skin rejuvenation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H903511\"><span class=\"h2\">Dark skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although photodamage often is less severe in individuals with dark skin compared with fair-skinned people, patients with skin phototypes IV and higher also present for the treatment of photoaging. Laser induced dyspigmentation is a major concern in this population, as the risk for this adverse effect rises with increasing baseline skin pigmentation. (See <a href=\"#H7559620\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1449770\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p>Hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation may occur with all forms of ablative laser resurfacing, but is most likely to occur after treatment with traditional CO<sub>2</sub> lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/3,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-12</a>]. Thus, we generally avoid the use of traditional CO<sub>2</sub> lasers for the treatment of photodamage in patients with skin phototype IV or higher. Fractional ablative lasers may be a preferable alternative in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Additional studies are necessary to determine the most appropriate treatments and laser settings for ablative laser therapy for skin rejuvenation in patients with dark skin. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693104\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonfacial sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ablative laser resurfacing for photodamage primarily is used for the treatment of the face; however, patients frequently present with photodamage on other photoexposed areas such as the neck and hands. Due to an unacceptably high risk for scarring, treatment with traditional CO<sub>2</sub> lasers is contraindicated in these locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The risk for scarring appears to be lower with fractional ablative lasers and traditional Er:YAG lasers, and successful treatment of the neck and hands with these devices has been documented in small, uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>]. Yet, treatment must be approached with caution, as the development of severe scarring after treatment has been reported in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832338\"><span class=\"h1\">TRADITIONAL ABLATIVE LASERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional ablative lasers used for skin rejuvenation include the 10,600 nm pulsed and rapidly scanning CO<sub>2</sub> lasers and the 2940 nm pulsed Er:YAG laser. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214349\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The theory of selective photothermolysis is the basis for the efficacy of traditional ablative lasers in skin rejuvenation. The theory is based upon the following principles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions#H31999074\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;, section on 'Selective photothermolysis'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The wavelength of light utilized should be absorbed preferentially by light absorbing molecules (chromophores) in the target and must penetrate the skin sufficiently to reach its depth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The light must be delivered in a period of time that is short enough to prevent the transfer of excessive heat to adjacent structures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The energy delivered per unit area (fluence) must be sufficient to exert the desired therapeutic effect, but should also be at a level that minimizes undesirable collateral tissue damage.</p><p/><p>The depth of light absorption into the skin generally rises with increasing light wavelengths. According to this principle, one would expect infrared light emitted from CO<sub>2</sub> and Er:YAG lasers to penetrate more deeply into the skin than light emitted from the 585 to 600 nm pulsed dye lasers that are often used for the treatment of vascular lesions in the dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60561\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60561 \">figure 2</a>). However, because light emitted by CO<sub>2</sub> and Er:YAG lasers is highly absorbed by water in the epidermis, little light reaches deeper levels of the skin. At a setting of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> and a pulse duration of less than 1 ms, light from the CO<sub>2</sub> laser penetrates to a depth of approximately 20 to 30 micrometers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Water molecules have an even greater affinity for light emitted from Er:YAG lasers, which reaches depths of only 1 to 3 micrometers per <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span>. </p><p>The absorption of light energy by water in the epidermis leads to the rapid accumulation of heat and consequent vaporization of the epidermis. Thermal damage extends beyond the penetration of light; residual thermal damage reaches depths of 100 to 150 micrometers with traditional CO<sub>2</sub> lasers and 10 to 40 micrometers with traditional ER:YAG lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The heat transferred to underlying dermal collagen is believed to contribute to collagen contraction and remodeling as well as clinically evident skin tightening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/6,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24-26</a>].</p><p>Excessive transfer of heat to the dermis can lead to adverse effects such as scarring and permanent hypopigmentation. To minimize this risk, the time the laser beam is in contact with the skin (pulse duration) should be shorter than the time it takes the treated area of skin to return to ambient temperature (tissue thermal relaxation time) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78746 \">figure 3</a>). CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing was initially performed with continuous wave CO<sub>2</sub> lasers, which offered relatively poor control over the duration of time that the laser beam was in contact with the skin. The development of the high energy pulsed CO<sub>2</sub> laser (pulse duration less than 1 ms) and short pulsed Er:YAG laser (pulse duration 250 to 350 mcs) allowed the delivery of sufficient amounts of energy to induce ablation, while maintaining tight control over the duration of light delivery and reducing the risk for inadvertent damage. Rapidly scanning CO<sub>2</sub> lasers utilize a computerized scanning mechanism to limit the duration of contact of the laser beam with any given site on the skin and are an alternative to pulsed devices. </p><p>The principles of laser therapy in the skin are discussed in greater detail separately.

Because the risks for temporary and permanent dyspigmentation are greatest with the CO<sub>2</sub> laser, we generally avoid CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing for skin rejuvenation in patients with skin phototypes IV or higher and prefer to use fractional ablative or traditional Er:YAG lasers in this subgroup of patients.

One randomized trial in which topical tretinoin 0.05% or a placebo cream was applied to the forearm for three weeks prior to CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing found no evidence that topical tretinoin enhanced collagen formation, accelerated reepithelialization, or stimulated more rapid resolution of postoperative erythema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether these findings are applicable to the treatment of facial skin.</p><p>The efficacy of another common practice, the use of preoperative topical skin-lightening agents, was brought into question by a randomized trial of 100 patients.

Topical anesthetics often are sufficient for focal procedures utilizing the Er:YAG laser. Local infiltrative anesthesia or nerve blocks can be used when additional anesthesia is required. Local anesthesia plus systemic anxiolytics, oral narcotics, or intramuscular sedation are usually needed for full face procedures or localized CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Intravenous anesthesia is often utilized during full face CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing.</p><p>More than one laser pass (retreatment of a site during the same treatment session) is often performed in ablative laser resurfacing. The effacement of wrinkles indicates the treatment endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A yellow or brown color noted after wiping away desiccated tissue after a pass with a CO<sub>2</sub> laser suggests tissue necrosis; additional laser passes should not be performed if this is detected. Two passes are often performed during treatment of rhytides with the CO<sub>2</sub> laser, and between four and ten passes typically are required to achieve desired results with Er:YAG devices.

Postoperative management includes the use of cool compresses, head elevation, and saline or water soaks applied as often as is necessary to keep the skin moist. Moisture promotes wound healing, and both open and closed wound care techniques have been advocated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We favor the open technique and instruct patients to apply petrolatum ointment to the treatment area after each soak until reepithelialization is complete. Advocates of the closed technique tend to utilize wound dressings for the first 24 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/2,3,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,60</a>].

Makeup with a green tint is useful for masking erythema. Throughout this period, patients should engage in daily sun protective practices and daily sunscreen use to reduce the development of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. When it occurs, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation improves slowly over time; daily application of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> cream, retinoids, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peeling agents such as glycolic acid can be prescribed to accelerate resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>].

The ablative fractional lasers include the 2940 nm fractional erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser, the 2790 nm fractional yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG) laser, and the 10,600 nm fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser. Nonablative fractional lasers emit wavelengths of light that are less strongly absorbed by water molecules in the skin. Nonablative fractional lasers have also been used for skin rejuvenation, but are less effective for this indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Fractional lasers deliver a multitude of narrow columns of laser light to the skin, resulting in the creation of numerous microscopic vertical zones of thermal damage called microscopic thermal zones (MTZs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53757 \">figure 1</a>). MTZs are usually less than 400 micrometers in diameter and up to 1300 micrometers deep; the type of fractional laser and specific laser settings determine the size of the MTZ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>The undamaged surrounding skin immediately adjacent to an MTZ serves as a reservoir of viable tissue, permitting the rapid repopulation of the epidermis observed after fractional laser therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Reepithelialization typically occurs within a few days. In contrast, reepithelialization after traditional laser ablation is dependent on migration of epidermal cells from adnexal structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A skin tightening effect also occurs after treatment with ablative fractional lasers; both immediate and delayed collagen contraction and collagen remodeling may contribute to improvements in skin laxity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/7,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7559526\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence in support of the efficacy of ablative fractional lasers for the treatment of photoaged skin is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In one small randomized split-face trial, use of a 590 nm light-emitting diode array reduced the severity and duration of post-treatment erythema by one to two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Viral, bacterial, or fungal infections can follow treatment. The risk for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection after fractional laser resurfacing is lower than for traditional laser resurfacing (0.3 to 2 percent versus 2 to 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, all patients undergoing fractional resurfacing of the entire face or who have a history of facial HSV infection should be treated with antiviral prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. We typically administer either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> 200 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> 500 mg twice daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> 500 mg twice daily. Treatment should begin one day prior to treatment and should be continued for five to seven days after treatment. Patients with HSV infection may present only with nonspecific superficial erosions in the treated area. </p><p>Bacterial infection is uncommon, and as with traditional ablative laser resurfacing, the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial. We generally reserve antibiotic prophylaxis for people who we perceive to be at high risk for infection, such as immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Signs of infection include worsening pain, drainage, erosions, or crusting within the first few days after treatment. In our experience, patients who develop candidal infections frequently complain of intense pruritus. </p><p>When infection is suspected, the involved sites should be cultured and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be administered while awaiting culture results. Candidal infections are managed with oral antifungal agents. </p><p>Similar to traditional ablative laser resurfacing, the risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation rises with increasing baseline skin pigmentation. However, the duration and severity of hyperpigmentation tends to be less in patients treated with fractional lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. We instruct patients to avoid sun exposure for two weeks prior to treatment and for two weeks after therapy to reduce this risk. Longer treatment intervals and adjustments to the energy and density settings may be beneficial for reducing the incidence of hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/11,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,47</a>]. Hypopigmentation is rare after fractional laser resurfacing. </p><p>Scarring also is uncommon, but can be devastating when it occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Initial signs of scarring include a focal, persistent area of erythema or induration that appears a few weeks after therapy. Most cases of scarring after fractional laser resurfacing have involved treatment of the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Other complications of fractional ablative laser resurfacing include transient acneiform eruptions, milia, and ectropion. Ectropion may be most likely to occur in patients with a history of eyelid surgery or reduced skin elasticity in this area at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1450050\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693277\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative measures are similar to those for traditional ablative laser resurfacing.

A topical anesthetic is applied one hour prior to treatment and cold air is used to further improve patient comfort during the treatment session. The use of cold air is supported by a nonrandomized prospective split-face study that found that treatment with a fractional C0<sub>2</sub> laser was less painful when given with both cold air anesthesia and topical anesthesia than when given with topical anesthesia alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. For more aggressive procedures, local nerve blocks, oral sedatives, or intravenous anesthesia may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Laser settings are not transferable between different ablative fractional laser devices, and clinician familiarity with the device utilized is essential. In general, the use of higher energies with small spot sizes increases the depth of laser injury. Increasing the pulse duration widens the diameter of the MTZ and may increase the depth of ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The density setting, which determines the amount of space between the MTZs, can also be altered. It is advisable to reduce density settings in areas at greater risk for complications such as the neck and periocular skin; higher densities may be appropriate for deep rhytides, such as those in the perioral area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Early fractional lasers required the application of a blue dye to the skin to optimize functioning, but this is no longer necessary with most devices. A thick layer of gel is applied before the start of treatment, and the number of laser passes needed is determined by the specific laser system and laser settings. Similar to nonfractional ablative lasers, treatment of an entire cosmetic unit is preferred if full-face treatment is not being performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69743\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69743 \">figure 4</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1449918\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative'</a> above).

Home care after less intense treatments involves gentle skin cleansing and repeated application of the ointment to maintain constant skin moisture until crusting ceases (usually by day three) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In more aggressively treated individuals (bleeding associated with treatment), we apply a biologic dressing that is removed 24 hours later and is followed by soaking and gentle cleansing of the skin every three to four hours for five to seven days. After each soak the ointment should be reapplied to maintain skin moisture. Subsequently, a nongreasy moisturizing cream can be utilized. </p><p>For patients who develop pruritus during the healing period, we prescribe a mid-potency topical corticosteroid for application twice daily for a few days. Itching most commonly begins on the third postoperative day.</p><p>Desquamation for several days after treatment is normal. Scratching or rubbing of the skin should be avoided. As with ablative laser resurfacing, photoprotection is important to reduce risk for hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation is managed similarly to hyperpigmentation associated with traditional ablative lasers.</p><p>Most patients can return to work 4 to 10 days after fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing depending on the extent and intensity of treatment. After fractional Er:YAG laser resurfacing, the recovery period is between one and three days. We find that most patients require one to three treatments to achieve desired results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81643\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81643 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18975821\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ablative laser resurfacing procedures can lead to improvement in the clinical signs of photoaging. The ablative lasers used for skin resurfacing include pulsed and rapidly scanning carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) lasers, pulsed Er:YAG lasers, and fractional ablative lasers. (See <a href=\"#H15356078\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8009623\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be thoroughly informed of the expected treatment outcome, anticipated recovery period, and treatment risks prior to proceeding with ablative laser resurfacing. A variety of factors influence the selection of the appropriate laser resurfacing technique, including the severity and location of photodamage, the patient's skin color, and patient preference regarding the length of time required for healing. (See <a href=\"#H18975495\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both traditional CO<sub>2</sub> lasers and traditional Er:YAG lasers are effective for the treatment of photoaging. CO<sub>2</sub> lasers appear to have a greater effect on skin tightening, which may be related to greater transfer of heat to underlying dermal collagen during irradiation with the CO<sub>2</sub> laser. However, CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing is associated with a relatively longer recovery period, higher risk for scarring and dyspigmentation, and a longer period of persistent erythema after treatment. Due to an elevated risk for dyspigmentation in patients with dark skin, we typically limit CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing to patients with skin phototypes I to III. (See <a href=\"#H18975495\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H832338\" class=\"local\">'Traditional ablative lasers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional ablative laser resurfacing is contraindicated in patients with a history of keloidal scarring, recent history oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> therapy, and sclerotic disorders involving the site to be treated. Infraorbital resurfacing should not be performed in patients with ectropion. Relative contraindications include cutaneous disorders that may Koebnerize and a history of facial surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1449897\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic antiviral therapy should be provided to all patients undergoing full facial traditional or fractional ablative laser resurfacing due to a risk for herpes simplex virus reactivation. The need for antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial. If bacterial infection is suspected, the affected area should be cultured and systemic antibiotic therapy should be initiated. (See <a href=\"#H1449911\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1449770\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain management is often necessary during laser resurfacing. Depending on the type of procedure, patients may require only topical anesthetics or the addition of systemic agents. (See <a href=\"#H1449918\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1693270\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractional ablative lasers operate through the creation of numerous microscopic columns of thermal damage involving the epidermis and dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53757 \">figure 1</a>). Due to a relatively short recovery period, and a relatively low risk of adverse effects, fractional ablative lasers are increasingly becoming the preferred devices for ablative laser resurfacing. Additional studies are necessary to explore the efficacy and safety of fractional ablative lasers for rejuvenation. (See <a href=\"#H7559191\" class=\"local\">'Ablative fractional lasers'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ross EV, Grossman MC, Duke D, Grevelink JM.
