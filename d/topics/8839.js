They are the most common tumors of childhood. They are characterized by a growth phase and involution phase. Despite their benign and self-limited nature, some hemangiomas can cause complications such as ulceration or life-altering disfigurement. In addition, they may compromise vital organ function or herald underlying developmental anomalies of the central nervous system or spine. Infants with cutaneous hemangiomas, most often in the setting of multiple hemangiomas or a solitary segmental hemangioma, occasionally have additional hemangiomas of the liver, brain, respiratory tract, or gastrointestinal tract. Rarely, visceral hemangiomas can be symptomatic and associated with life-threatening complications.</p><p>The management of infantile hemangiomas will be discussed below. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, complications, and evaluation are discussed separately. Other vascular tumors of childhood are also discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapidly-involuting-congenital-hemangioma-rich-and-noninvoluting-congenital-hemangioma-nich\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma (RICH) and noninvoluting congenital hemangioma (NICH)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tufted-angioma-kaposiform-hemangioendothelioma-and-the-kasabach-merritt-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tufted angioma, kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, and the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3831693261\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to treatment of hemangiomas should be individualized, based upon the size of the lesion(s), morphology, location, presence or possibility of complications, potential for scarring or disfigurement, the age of the patient, and the rate of growth or involution at the time of evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The potential risk(s) of treatment must be carefully weighed against the potential benefits.</p><p>Consultation with <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral to a pediatric dermatologist, vascular anomalies team, or other knowledgeable specialist is warranted for children with hemangiomas with actual or potential risk for complications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when therapy is being considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Such children should be referred as early as possible during the early proliferation phase (ie, during the first few months of life).</p><p>Hemangiomas are managed with clinical examination(s) and education of the family regarding the natural course; potential complications; treatment indications; and risks, benefits, and expectations of available treatment options. Depending upon the type of lesion and the parents' level of concern, the patient may need to be re-evaluated frequently during the proliferative phase and again before school entry. Serial photographs of the lesion can help to monitor the clinical course.</p><p>Education of the family should include information about the natural course; potential complications; treatment indications; and risks, benefits, and expectations of available treatment options for hemangiomas. The family should be provided with realistic expectations about the duration of involution and the possibility of residual changes. The involution phase may continue up to the age of 10 years, although in some studies complete involution has been noted at a median age of four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, this timeline is highly variable and dependent on hemangioma size, morphology, and location. It must also be emphasized that, in many cases, involution does not result in normal-appearing skin. More than one-half of children with untreated hemangiomas experience residual changes such as scarring, atrophy, redundant skin, discoloration, and telangiectasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Finally, the family should be provided with anticipatory guidance regarding ways to respond to comments and queries from family members and strangers. Parents are commonly subject to inappropriate comments from strangers, including accusations of child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other children, who are usually extremely curious about the hemangioma, are often satisfied to know simply that &quot;It is a birthmark, it doesn't hurt, and it will get better&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Addressing the psychosocial aspects of care and providing the parents anticipatory guidance, emotional support, and reassurance are essential for the effective management of hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/4,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10-12</a>].</p><p>When treatment is indicated, the choice of treatment modality depends upon the above factors, as well as the availability of certain modalities and the experience of the treating clinician. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION AND GOALS OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intervention may be required for complicated lesions with potential to interfere with a vital structure or function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, the decision not to pursue medical and surgical therapy is not necessarily a passive intervention, since the growth and involution of the hemangioma may need to be monitored and the psychosocial implications, particularly of facial hemangiomas, anticipated and addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Topical beta blockers may be used for the treatment of small superficial hemangiomas (eg, hemangiomas of minor cosmetic concern located on the face, small lesions in the anogenital area) as an alternative to observation, particularly if parents desire treatment. Topical beta blockers may also have a role in the treatment of small ulcerated hemangiomas and in preventing rebound growth in children who are being tapered off oral propranolol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hemangiomas-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Serial injections administered at four-week intervals are sometimes needed. Adverse effects of intralesional corticosteroids most commonly include local skin atrophy from leaks or inadvertent application to normal surrounding skin.
