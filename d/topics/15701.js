Most people take medicines <strong>without</strong> having side effects, but some people do have them.</p><p>Some of the more common side effects of medicines can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upset stomach, diarrhea, or constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling more or less hungry than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry cough that doesn't go away</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin rashes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or sleepy, or getting tired easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sad, depressed, anxious, or jittery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H954586\"><span class=\"h1\">Can side effects be dangerous?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, in rare cases, side effects can be dangerous or even life threatening. For example, people can have severe allergic reactions to medicines.</p><p><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if you start a new medicine and have any of the symptoms listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing or trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain or tightness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out or feeling like you might pass out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158562970\"><span class=\"h1\">When can side effects start?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If side effects are going to happen, they will usually start soon after you begin a new medicine or when your dose is increased. Some side effects can happen in the first hours after taking a medicine, such as an allergic reaction or upset stomach. Others might not start for a week or even months, such as rashes or a dry cough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8525922\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if my medicines cause side effects?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call your doctor or nurse any time you have a possible side effect that bothers you. But it's especially important to call right away if you start a new medicine and get any of the symptoms listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives or rash (raised red bumps on the skin that can be itchy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling confused, or feeling like you want to hurt or kill yourself</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe stomachache, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not wanting to eat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aches, pain, fever, weakness or no energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark color urine, black stools (bowel movements), or yellow skin or eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other symptoms that worry you</p><p/><p>If you have other symptoms that you think might be related to your medicine, talk to your doctor. Do not simply stop taking the medicine that you think is causing the problem. The medicine might be very important for your health, and stopping the medicine might cause other problems. Plus, it's possible that what you think is a side effect is not actually a side effect at all.</p><p>Your doctor can help you figure out if the symptoms you are having are really side effects of your medicines or are caused by something else. If your symptoms are actually side effects, your doctor might be able to adjust your dose or switch you to a different medicine. There are often ways to help you feel better.</p><p>Even if your side effects can't be avoided, it's still important to talk to your doctor. He or she might be able to help you understand why the medicine you are taking is worth it even if it causes side effects.</p><p>Here are some things you should know or do to prevent or cope with side effects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Take medicine correctly to prevent side effects</strong> &ndash; Take the dose that is written on the prescription label (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F91797\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91797 \">figure 1</a>). This dose takes into account your age, weight, specific health problems, and the other medicines you take. Carefully follow all of the instructions on the label and printed patient education that comes with the medicine. (For example, some medicine labels say &quot;take with food,&quot; or &quot;avoid alcohol,&quot; or &quot;avoid driving until you know the effects of the medicine on you.&quot;) Also, follow the instructions your doctor gives you. He or she might tell you to start at a low dose and increase the dose slowly, so you don't have side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">You can also use a pill box that has a section for each day of the week. This can help you avoid taking too much or too little of your medicines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F113044\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113044 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Have your medicines checked to be sure you are taking them correctly</strong> &ndash; Bring a bag with <strong>all</strong> your medicines to your doctor's office. Have your doctor or nurse go over them with you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Be careful about mixing medicines</strong> &ndash; Some medicines do not mix well with other medicines, alcohol, or herbal products. Tell your doctor and pharmacist about <strong>all</strong> the medicines you take, including nonprescription (&quot;over-the-counter&quot;) medicines, herbs, and any other drugs. Have them check for drug interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Keep in mind that some side effects go away over time</strong> &ndash; As your body gets used to the medicine, the side effect might go away. For example, medicines to treat depression can sometimes bother your stomach for a while. But that side effect goes away after 1 or 2 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Work with your doctor find ways to manage your side effects</strong> &ndash; There are usually simple things you can do to make side effects less bothersome. For example, some medicines can make you feel sleepy, but if you take them just before bed, this is not a problem. Other medicines can make you constipated, but you can reduce constipation if you can eat more fruits and vegetables, drink more water, and use a stool softener. If a blood pressure medicine or antidepressant causes sexual problems, you might be able to take another medicine to improve sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The important thing is to talk to your doctor about any side effects that bother you. That way he or she can offer solutions. Not everyone has the same side effects, so your doctor won't know what's happening with you unless you tell him or her.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8525962\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I find out the known side effects of my medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few different ways you can find this out:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse what side effects to expect when he or she prescribes the medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your pharmacist about the side effects when you get your prescriptions filled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask what you should do to avoid side effects and what to do if they do happen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Read the printed information for patients that comes with the medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check online at <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/&amp;token=lblfowwGB6QwC91WNuiIf3Bneb9hTOlFvViRf8ZTQ5q3jNznOObOwFsCCFT0xYvI&amp;TOPIC_ID=16828\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/</a> for information about the medicine.</p><p/><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. The Lexicomp hand-outs explain how to use and store your medicines. They also list possible side effects and warn you if your medicines should not be taken with certain other medicines or foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8525977\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-medicines-when-youre-older-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking medicines when you're older (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Drug allergy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
