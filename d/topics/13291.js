For example, pressure ulcers predominantly predispose to infections of the sacrum and adjacent portions of the ileum. IV drug abuse, cardiac catheterization, and bacteremia have a propensity to cause infections of the pubis. Pelvic or urologic surgery can result in infection of the pubis as well as other sites such as the sacroiliac joint. Rarely, infection arises spontaneously without an identifiable cause; such cases are likely complications of bacteremia that developed from an unrecognized site or event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In some circumstances, it may be impossible to determine if trauma alone or trauma plus an incidental bacteremia led to the subsequent infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539708288\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pelvic walls contain bone, ligaments, and muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F97690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97690 \">figure 1</a>). The bony pelvis consists of two hip bones (os coxae) that are joined in front by the pubic symphysis. The os coxae articulate posteriorly with the sacrum. The hip (coxal) bones consist of the ileum, the ischium, and the pubis. Both the pubis and ischium are further divided into their respective bodies and rami. The os coxae have been likened to a propeller with two oppositely bent blades with a central shaft (the acetabulum).</p><p>The pelvis contains two joints: the sacroiliac joint and the symphysis pubis. The sacroiliac joint has a synovial lining; the symphysis pubis consists of apposed cartilaginous layers on either side of an interpubic disk consisting of fibrocartilage. Fibrous ligaments such as the iliolumbar ligament further stabilize the bony pelvis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14210382\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathogens responsible for pelvic osteomyelitis vary depending on the pathogenesis of the infection. Hematogenous infections are commonly due to <em>S. aureus,</em> but almost any pathogen capable of causing primary or secondary bacteremia can cause a hematogenous infection in the bony pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Intravenous drug abusers who develop pubic osteomyelitis or septic sacroiliitis appear to have a higher propensity to have <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> as a causative pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Postoperative pelvic osteomyelitis infections and infections secondary to decubitus ulcers are commonly mixed infections due to bowel or perineal flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539708295\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14210462\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute sacroiliitis or pubic osteomyelitis may have fever and severe pain; however, many bony infections of the pelvis present subacutely with or without associated fever. Physical examination may be useful when predisposing causes such as pressure ulcers are present and patients have localized pain and tenderness over discrete sites such as the symphysis pubis or sacroiliac joints. In other cases, pain may be poorly localized or accompanied by other confusing symptoms such as antalgic gait or hip or buttock pain. In patients with spinal cord injury, pain may be absent.</p><p>Several clinical aspects of pelvic osteomyelitis and septic arthritis warrant special emphasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/8,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be a long interval between a precipitating cause (such as trauma or surgery) and the onset of pelvic osteomyelitis, and fever may be absent. These factors may contribute to diagnostic delay.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pubic osteomyelitis initially develop an infection of the pubic symphysis that later produces osteomyelitis in adjacent pubic rami. Such patients characteristically have severe pelvic pain associated with point tenderness overlying the symphysis pubis. They usually also have difficulty walking and manifest a characteristic wide-based waddling gait.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pyogenic sacroiliitis and secondary pelvic osteomyelitis may have vague poorly localized pain or pain in the buttock or hip. However, focal tenderness on exam is usually present with pressure or percussion over the sacroiliac region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pelvic osteomyelitis may develop abscesses in soft tissues adjacent to the bony pelvis or infection may dissect into areas that are quite distant from the site of bony involvement. For example, pubic osteomyelitis can lead to bilateral abscesses in the adductor muscles of the thigh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539708303\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteitis pubis and pubic osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteitis pubis is an idiopathic postoperative complication of suprapubic cystotomy. Patients with this condition have bony destruction of the margins of the symphysis pubis, severe pelvic pain, and a characteristic wide-based waddling gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Osteitis pubis has been recognized as a complication of a wide range of urologic and gynecologic surgical procedures. It has been described in association with pregnancy, hernia repairs, pyelonephritis, and presumed trauma in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sinus tracts, a characteristic manifestation of osteomyelitis, have been described in some patients. Fever is usually absent.</p><p>The pathogenesis of osteitis pubis is uncertain. Possible etiologies include infection, mechanical trauma to the symphysis, local vascular damage, or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Some experts believe that all cases of osteitis pubis are secondary to infection (eg, that osteitis pubis is synonymous with pubic osteomyelitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Others believe that pubic osteomyelitis and osteitis pubis are separate conditions (ie, that osteitis pubis is not an infectious disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Even though this controversy remains unresolved, the possibility of infection (osteomyelitis) should be carefully assessed in every patient with presumed osteitis pubis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteitis-pubis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteitis pubis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111644826\"><span class=\"h2\">Sacral osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most commonly, sacral osteomyelitis arises from contiguous spread of infection from deep (stage IV) pressure ulcers. It may also arise as a complication of open or laparoscopic pelvic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], following pelvic radiation, spinal or anal surgery, after penetrating trauma such as a gunshot wound, or in the setting of sacral fracture or epidural anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539708311\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histopathological examination of a bone biopsy are required in order to make a definitive diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Compatible symptoms in the setting of relevant risk factors, together with positive blood cultures and radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis, may also be diagnostic. Aspiration and cultures of pus obtained from abscesses that are contiguous to bony pelvic abnormalities may supplant the need for bone biopsy in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>White blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and measurement of C-reactive protein levels may provide clues to the presence of an infectious process in the bony pelvis. However, these tests lack specificity in distinguishing bony infection from other noninfectious conditions such as seronegative spondyloarthropathies.</p><p>Plain radiography is not sensitive for detecting osteomyelitis, although it may be useful to exclude other causes of pain such as tumor or fractures. Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive than plain radiography in detecting pelvic osteomyelitis, pyogenic sacroiliitis, or early pubic osteomyelitis but is less sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT or ultrasound may be useful in detecting soft tissue swelling and abscess formation in contiguous soft tissues, particularly when aspiration or drainage procedures are planned.</p><p>MRI is the most sensitive radiographic modality for detection of pelvic osteomyelitis. Marrow abnormalities typical of osteomyelitis may be detected by MRI before lytic or other typical changes of osteomyelitis appear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111644960\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic bone and joint infections can be difficult to distinguish from other mimics. For example, pubic osteomyelitis may rarely be confused with spermatic cord torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, a rare condition of unknown etiology that most often affects long bones, can affect the bony pelvis in rare cases, particularly in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Postradiation changes, healing fractures, and a variety of pathological problems involving the hip can also be mimics of pelvic osteomyelitis. Obturator pyomyositis can rarely mimic pelvic osteomyelitis as well as lead to secondary osteomyelitis of the ischio-pubic bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539708319\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles of treatment of pelvic osteomyelitis are the same as for other types of osteomyelitis: debridement of infected or necrotic tissues and a long course of antimicrobial therapy directed at the causative pathogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A few unique aspects of the treatment of pelvic osteomyelitis warrant special emphasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thorough debridement of infected ileal, acetabular, or ischeal bone in the pelvis may be exceedingly difficult because of the proximity of overlying or adjacent structures such as the sacral plexus or because of difficult access for areas deep with the pelvis. In some cases, a long course of intravenous antibiotics (eg, six to eight weeks) may be curative even without a thorough debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similarly, patients with pyogenic sacroiliitis can often be managed with prolonged antimicrobial therapy if a discrete abscess or contiguous osteomyelitis is not present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debridement of the symphysis pubis may result in further instability and secondary gait problems. Some cases of pubic osteomyelitis have been managed with long courses of antimicrobial therapy without extensive debridement after needle biopsy demonstrated a causative pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/10,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic osteomyelitis due to sacral decubitus ulcer generally requires surgical debridement for cure. In many cases, tissue reconstruction is required following debridement and antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one cohort study including 220 patients with pelvic osteomyelitis associated with decubitus ulcer, patients who received debridement and antibiotic therapy were less likely to be readmitted during the subsequent year than patients who received antibiotic therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cure of advanced osteomyelitis due to adjacent sacral decubitus ulcers may be impossible.
