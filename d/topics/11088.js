It has been a known human pathogen since it was first isolated in the late nineteenth century by Edwin Klebs.</p><p>The microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of infections due to <em>K. pneumoniae</em> will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of infections due to this organism are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> has three subspecies with homologous DNAs but different biochemical reactions: <em>K. pneumoniae</em> subsp <em>pneumoniae</em>, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> subsp <em>ozaenae</em>, and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> subsp <em>rhinoscleromatis</em>. For the remainder of this topic review, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> will specifically refer to <em>K. pneumoniae</em> subsp <em>pneumoniae</em>.</p><p>The following are the characteristic biochemical reactions of the different organisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> is lactose fermenting, H2S- and indole-negative, has a positive Voges-Proskauer (VP) reaction, is capable of growth in KCN and using citrate as a sole carbon source, and is incapable of growth at 10&ordm;C.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other two subspecies (<em>ozaenae</em> and <em>rhinoscleromatis</em>) are indole-negative with a negative VP reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Klebsiella oxytoca</em>, which is one of the other species of the genus, is indole-positive, has a positive VP reaction, and is able to grow at 10&ordm;C.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five major virulence factors of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of infection: capsular serotype, hypermucoviscosity phenotype, lipopolysaccharide, siderophores, and pili (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79361 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The degree of virulence conferred by <em>K. pneumoniae</em> can be determined by several methods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68146 \">table 2</a>). A single strain of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> can express an inconsistent degree of virulence in different virulence testing assays.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Capsular serotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The capsular polysaccharide antigens of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> can be classified into 77 serotypes. Serotype prevalence varies widely in different regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. Worldwide, K2 is the most common capsular serotype of human clinical isolates, usually from urine or sputum specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, in different series, serotypes 2, 21, and 55 were most common in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and 21, 2, and 55 were most common in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; K1 was the predominant capsular serotype in bacteremia, liver abscess, and septic endophthalmitis isolates in Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>] and in liver abscess isolates in Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; and K54 was the major serotype from urinary, sputum, and blood isolates in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The K1 and K2 isolates are generally more virulent than <span class=\"nowrap\">non-K1/K2</span> isolates in terms of lethality for a mouse when injected intraperitoneally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The discrepancies in the degree of virulence observed among strains with different capsule types may be explained by two major mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrophages with the lectin or mannose receptor can recognize the capsular sugar sequences of <span class=\"nowrap\">mannose-alpha-2/3-mannose</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">L-rhamnose-alpha-2/3-L-rhamnose,</span> particular of <span class=\"nowrap\">non-K1/K2</span> antigens. Subsequent macrophage-mediated ingestion and killing of organisms is nonopsonic and known as lectinophagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The K1 or K2 antigens lack these mannose or rhamnose sequences, which can protect these isolates from lectinophagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strains of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> with K1 or K2 capsule serotypes are more often hypermucoviscous than <span class=\"nowrap\">non-K1/K2</span> strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'RmpA gene'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Some capsular serotypes such as K1, K2, and K25 may contribute to host infection by protecting the organism against phagocytosis by neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, the capsular polysaccharide may play an important role in the development of respiratory tract infection by protecting against phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypermucoviscosity phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> strains possess the hypermucoviscosity phenotype if they are capable of producing a mucoviscous exopolysaccharide web. In the microbiology laboratory, these strains grow in sticky colonies on agar plates and are identified by a string test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A positive string test is indicated by a &gt;5 mm viscous string from the colony on an agar plate when stretched by a standard bacteriologic loop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53292\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53292 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The clinically invasive nature of some <em>K. pneumoniae</em> strains correlates with these microbiologic characteristics.</p><p>Strains with the hypermucoviscosity phenotype or with enhanced production of polysaccharide capsule independent of capsular K serotypes are more resistant to complement-mediated serum killing than those without the hypermucoviscosity phenotype or those with reduced capsule production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The clinical importance of these observations was illustrated in a study in which hypermucoviscosity correlated with high serum resistance and was present in 52 of 53 strains causing invasive infection (liver abscess) compared with 9 of 52 noninvasive strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A number of clinical studies have demonstrated a significant association between the hypermucoviscosity phenotype and a destructive tissue abscess syndrome, including abscesses in the liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/5,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20-24</a>].</p><p>These relationships were illustrated in a review of 151 <em>K. pneumoniae</em> isolates from patients with bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hypermucoviscosity phenotype was found in 38 percent. The rate was higher with community-acquired compared with nosocomial infections (49 versus 15 percent), a finding that is consistent with the association of the tissue abscess syndrome with community-acquired infections. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Association with primary liver abscess'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 95 isolates from secondary bacteremia (excluding five isolates from mixed infections), a hypermucoviscosity phenotype was found in a significantly higher proportion of isolates from any abscess site (eg, liver, neck) compared with nonabscess sites such as the urinary tract or to isolates from primary bacteremia (85 versus 23 and 25 percent).</p><p/><p>The outer layer of the capsule of most <em>K. pneumoniae</em> consists of a network structure of fine fibers derived from capsular polysaccharide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], known as the exopolysaccharide web. This structure is encoded by the capsular polysaccharide (cps) gene cluster on the chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and is positively regulated by plasmid-mediated genes, including rmpA (regulator of mucoid phenotype gene A) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>], rmpA2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>] and magA (mucoid associated gene A) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">RmpA gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The capsule of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> is encoded by the capsular polysaccharide (cps) gene cluster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], which may be regulated by plasmid-born rmpA and rmpA2 genes to enhance extracapsular polysaccharide synthesis and produce the hypermucoviscosity phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>].</p><p>The rmpA gene was significantly associated with a hypermucoviscosity phenotype, being found in 90 percent of such isolates compared with 22 percent of isolates without a hypermucoviscosity phenotype. On the other hand, the hypermucoviscosity phenotype occurred in only 81 percent of rmpA-positive isolates. These observations suggest that other factors control full expression of rmpA or the hypermucoviscosity phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Mutation of rmpA gene (insertion or deletion), however, may contribute to the negative hypermucoviscosity phenotype and low virulence in some rmpA-positive isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">MagA gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MagA encodes a 43 kD outer membrane protein. The magA gene is located within an operon that is specific to the serotype K1 capsular polysaccharide (cps) gene cluster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>], and the operon containing magA is responsible for the K1 capsular serotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In one report, for example, serotype K1 was present in all 36 magA-positive strains compared to none of 38 magA-negative strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Restriction of magA to serotype K1 strains has also been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/5,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,36,37</a>]. Further sequencing of the magA<em> </em>flanking region revealed that magA<em> </em>was the serotype K1 allele of the polymerase wzy<em> </em>loci in the cps<em> </em>operon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/6,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,38,39</a>]. As magA was a K1-antigen&ndash;specific polymerase, it has been proposed that magA<em> </em>has to be renamed wzy<sub>KpK1</sub>, the capsular polymerase specific to <em>K. pneumoniae</em> serotype K1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Other serotypes K2, K5, K20, K54, K57 and a new capsular type KN1 have different alleles at the wzy loci, which are the capsular polymerases specific to their cps gene clusters of different serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/6,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,40,41</a>]. </p><p>A study using transposon mutagenesis to identify candidate virulence genes demonstrated that magA-positive strains had a mucoviscous exopolysaccharide web, resisted phagocytosis, and produced liver abscesses and meningitis in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. On the other hand, magA-negative mutants of serotype K1 strains lacked the exopolysaccharide web, became susceptible to phagocytosis, and were not virulent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Relationship between magA and rmpA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have evaluated the relationship among magA, rmpA, and the hypermucoviscosity phenotype:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hypermucoviscosity phenotype is not confined to magA-positive isolates (ie, serotype K1 strains) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/20,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,37</a>] nor is it found in all magA-positive isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RmpA can be responsible for the hypermucoviscosity phenotype of magA-negative isolates (such as K2 or other non-K1 serotype strains) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and rmpA-negative isolates of magA-positive strains may lack the hypermucoviscosity phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The k2A gene is seen only in serotype K2 strains and corresponds to the magA region in the cps gene cluster in serotype K1 isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, k2A in serotype K2 isolates may play a similar pathogenetic role as magA in serotype K1 isolates.</p><p/><p>A report of 73 <em>K. pneumoniae</em> isolates from liver abscess evaluated the relationship between rmpA carriage and capsule serotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. RmpA carriage was found in all 49 K1 or K2 isolates compared to 16 of 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">non-K1/K2</span> isolates, suggesting that <span class=\"nowrap\">K1/K2</span> isolates are generally more hypermucoviscous than <span class=\"nowrap\">non-K1/K2</span> isolates. In addition, <span class=\"nowrap\">K1/K2</span> isolates had more resistance to phagocytosis than rmpA-positive <span class=\"nowrap\">non-K1/K2</span> isolates. The latter observation is consistent with other studies showing that the mucoid phenotype mediated by the plasmid-encoded rmpA gene is an important virulence factor in addition to the capsule in K1 and K2 <em>K. pneumoniae</em> isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In summary, the rmpA gene is a positive regulator of extracapsular polysaccharide synthesis and confers a hypermucoviscosity phenotype in most isolates. In K1 isolates, the magA gene is essential for the formation of the exopolysaccharide web, a process that can be enhanced by rmpA. Capsular serotypes K1 and K2 also may contribute to virulence, independent of rmpA and magA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Association with primary liver abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary liver abscess refers to infections that occur in the absence of a history of hepatobiliary disease. Most cases of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> primary liver abscess have been reported in Taiwan and are community-acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/4-6,18,20,21,35,42-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,18,20,21,35,42-48</a>].</p><p>MagA-positivity has been strongly associated with primary community-acquired liver abscess in humans and is less often present in other <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/18,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,35</a>]. The association with magA was illustrated in a report in which 35 of 42 (83 percent) <em>K. pneumoniae</em> strains from patients with primary liver abscess were magA-positive compared with only 1 of 32 strains associated with other types of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Similar findings were noted in another study in which magA was significantly more prevalent in invasive strains that caused primary liver abscess compared with noninvasive strains that did not (98 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>However, lower rates of magA (K1 capsular serotype)-positivity have been noted in other series of patients with liver abscess, with values ranging from 34 to 63 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/4,6,7,20,21,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7,20,21,36</a>], and rmpA-positive isolates have predominated in several series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/5,6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,20</a>]. The discrepancy in findings may be in part related to inconsistent distinction between primary and secondary liver abscess. As an example, a liver abscess in a patient with a small silent gallstone is more likely to represent a primary infection.</p><p>MagA and the hypermucoviscosity phenotype are much less common in <em>K. pneumoniae</em> secondary liver abscess as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 129 patients with liver abscess in which 53 were considered primary and 76 secondary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The rate of K1 positivity was much higher in the primary abscesses (81 versus 42 percent). As noted above, magA is associated with the K1 capsular serotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Thus, prior studies showing an association between K1 and liver abscess, particularly if complicated by endophthalmitis, may have reflected magA-positive strains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two series, the hypermucoviscosity phenotype was present in 40 of 51 cases of primary liver abscess compared with 9 of 39 cases of cholangitis (78 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p>Some studies have suggested that the K1 or K2 capsular serotype is a more important virulence determinant for <em>K. pneumoniae</em> liver abscess than magA or rmpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and that genotype K1 may be particularly associated with the risk of metastatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Such infections can occur in patients without any underlying predisposing medical conditions, which is a reflection of the virulent nature of the K1 strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, serum resistance assays have shown that K1 isolates were significantly more virulent than K2 or other isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Non-K1 or K2 capsular types of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> strains causing primary liver abscess have mainly included K5, K20, K54, K57, and KN1 isolates, which were almost all rmpA-positive and of hypermucoviscosity phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/6,40,41,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,40,41,49</a>].</p><p>A possible mechanism for the role of the K1 capsular serotype in virulence is that chromosomal regions with additional virulence genes (magA, <span class=\"nowrap\">kfu/PTS</span> [a regulator of iron uptake], and allS) are selectively present on the serotype K1 genome; genotype K1 strains with all three genomic regions are strongly associated with primary liver abscess and metastatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Because of the scarcity of iron in the microenvironment, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> and other bacteria have developed multiple mechanisms to enhance iron uptake. These include synthesis of iron chelators (siderophores), such as enterobactin (also called enterochelin) and aerobactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>], the aerobactin receptor to introduce exogenous aerobactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], and the kfu iron uptake system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Enterobactin is the main iron uptake system and is synthesized by almost all <em>K. pneumoniae</em> strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].

This is consistent with the finding in a review of 241 blood isolates of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> that all 15 isolates (6 percent) producing aerobactin were associated with the hypermucoviscosity phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, 20 percent of the isolates had a hypermucoviscosity phenotype. Thus, although the aerobactin gene was always associated with the rmpA gene, the rmpA gene was not always associated with the aerobactin gene indicating that some rmpA-encoding plasmids do not contain the aerobactin gene.</p><p>These observations suggest that the association of aerobactin with virulence could be mediated at least in part by the concurrent presence of the mucoid phenotype.

Further support for the role of iron uptake in virulence in <em>K. pneumoniae</em> comes from a study in which the kfu iron uptake system was associated with liver abscess formation and distant metastatic infection such as endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

This can result in bacterial colonization, subsequent proliferation on the host mucosal surfaces, and clinical infection such as pyelonephritis or pneumonia. Type 3 pili are also required for biofilm formation by <em>K. pneumoniae</em> on plastics and human extracellular matrix, leading to the formation of treatment-resistant biofilm on indwelling plastic devices, such as intravenous and urinary catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p/><p>These effects of pili may be counteracted by host responses.
