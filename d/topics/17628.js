Many patients with pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension, particularly those in group 4 PAH and some in group 1 PAH (eg, idiopathic and drug-induced PAH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105764 \">table 4</a>), receive oral anticoagulants on the basis of observational studies suggesting benefit. However, because patients with PVOD may have a greater de novo risk of alveolar hemorrhage and no trials exist to show benefit in this population, some clinicians, including one author of this topic, avoid routine anticoagulation. In contrast, some experts, including one author of this topic, do routinely anticoagulate when the risk of alveolar hemorrhage is assessed as low; in those cases, we typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and target an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2 and 3. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>The avoidance of anticoagulants in this population by some experts is based upon one observational study that reported a higher percentage of hemosiderin-laden macrophages identified on bronchoscopy in eight patients with PVOD compared with eleven patients who had idiopathic PAH (40 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whether or not patients with PVOD have clinically relevant bleeding, as opposed to microscopic bleeding, and whether or not the risk is increased on anticoagulants remains unknown. PVOD is not an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, when administered for treatment of venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation). In our experience, small-volume hemoptysis may occur and usually does not require the discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy; however, we typically terminate anticoagulant therapy if more than 50 mL of blood are expectorated over a 24-hour period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hemoptysis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hemoptysis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478455948\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANCED THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-specific advanced therapy is treatment that is directed at the pulmonary hypertension itself, rather than an underlying cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107137\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107137 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1237971983\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) are at <strong>increased </strong>risk of developing pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and even death from advanced therapy with studies reporting rates of this complication ranging from 5 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. While some experts choose not to administer advanced therapy to this population, we suggest that cautious trials of single agent therapy may be administered as a bridge to lung transplantation in a select group of patients with PVOD who are fully informed of the risks. In rare instances, patients who do not desire or are not appropriate candidates for lung transplantation, some experts, including authors of this topic, administer cautious trials of advanced therapy on a palliative basis since advanced therapy is thought by some experts to slow the rate of disease progression despite significant improvement in symptomatology. (See <a href=\"#H478461298\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p>When advanced therapy is chosen, we suggest that it be administered using low doses of agent together with close monitoring and rapidly available treatment of pulmonary edema with oxygen and high dose diuretics; therapy can then be slowly escalated to the maximum tolerated dose. This preference is based upon our experience and that of others that suggest some benefit to this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Trials of therapy should be given approximately 6 to 12 weeks before abandoning the approach. (See <a href=\"#H563529204\" class=\"local\">'Prostanoids'</a> below.)</p><p>Although patient selection for advanced therapy should be individualized, patients with PVOD who may benefit the most include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are severely ill (eg, World Health Organization [WHO] functional class IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62080 \">table 2</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with markedly impaired cardiac index or refractory right ventricular failure) and need an urgent life-saving bridge to lung transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom the suspicion for a large component of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension is high (eg, patients with atypical findings of PVOD during diagnostic evaluation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105764 \">table 4</a>).

Importantly, unlike patients with PAH, initial <strong>single</strong> agent therapy is preferred rather than combination therapy due to the likely increased risk of pulmonary edema from the latter. (See <a href=\"#H478456639\" class=\"local\">'Combination'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1279830076\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimizing the risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced therapy should <strong>not</strong> be administered in those with overt pulmonary edema.</p><p>The development of pulmonary edema in this population during the administration of advanced therapy is thought to be due to relatively greater pulmonary arteriolar vasodilation than associated pulmonary venodilation (advanced therapy does not have a rapid dilatory effect on pulmonary veins); pulmonary arteriolar resistance decreases while pulmonary venous resistance remains fixed, resulting in an increase in transcapillary hydrostatic pressure, which in turn results in the transudation of fluid from the vascular space to the alveolar space (ie, pulmonary edema).</p><p>To overcome this adverse effect, many experts initially use <strong>low doses</strong> of an advanced agent together with high dose diuretic and oxygen therapy; starting doses are unknown and should be individualized but one-half or lower of the recommended dose for non PVOD patients is appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50798 \">table 5</a>). If tolerated, the dose is slowly increased (every one to two weeks) until a maximum tolerated dose is reached or an adverse effect is noted. In most studies, and in our experience, patients develop this side effect within hours or days such that monitoring should be vigilant during this period. Protocols vary among centers and should be tailored according to the institution and the individual being treated. This approach was best studied in patients taking prostanoids and is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H563529204\" class=\"local\">'Prostanoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H478461298\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H563528038\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing vasoreactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While it is recommended that patients with group 1 PAH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71168\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71168 \">algorithm 1</a>) undergo a vasoreactivity test prior to the initiation of advanced therapy, whether or not it is indicated in patients with PVOD is unclear. This is because the administration of vasodilators during testing may induce acute pulmonary edema and the response to CCB therapy, the primary therapy used in patients who are vasoreactive, is limited. In addition, positive testing does not completely predict whether or not pulmonary edema will develop with CCB or non CCB therapy. Nonetheless, we typically perform vasoreactivity testing based upon the rationale that some patients with a positive response may demonstrate tolerance to, and improvement with, calcium channel blocker therapy (CCB), which can be identified on vasoreactivity testing. </p><p>Vasoreactivity testing involves the administration of a short-acting vasodilator (eg, nitric oxide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoprostenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoprostenol</a>, and adenosine) followed by measurement of the hemodynamic response using a right heart catheter. When vasoreactivity testing is performed, the optimal choice of agent and dose is unknown. We and other experts use inhaled nitric oxide with limited exposure time and dose; one report suggested that less than 10 minutes of exposure to 10 ppm of inhaled nitric oxide was not associated with pulmonary edema in 24 patients with PVOD but was adequate to test for vasoreactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Vasoreactivity testing using intravenous epoprostenol may carry the greatest risk of pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Details regarding vasoreactivity testing are discussed separately.

However, in contrast to patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, we suggest that initial combination therapy be avoided in patients with PVOD due to the increased risk of adverse effects (see <a href=\"#H478456639\" class=\"local\">'Combination'</a> below). Agent selection is individualized and varies according to the institution, patient preference, and cost. Among the available oral agents, an endothelin receptor antagonist or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor may be appropriate. Experience with guanylate cyclase stimulators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=riociguat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">riociguat</a>) or oral selective prostacyclin-receptor agonists has not been reported and thus they are not recommended.
