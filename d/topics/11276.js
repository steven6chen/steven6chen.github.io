While prostate cancer remains a lethal disease (killing roughly 1 in every 36 American males), it represents a disease spectrum, particularly when localized disease is diagnosed, with up to half of men not needing immediate intervention. In addition to this, there are men with higher risk localized disease for whom the extent of treatment remains unclear (ie, surgical only, radiation only, or a combined modality approach that may include surgery, radiation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> androgen deprivation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-regionally-localized-intermediate-high-and-very-high-risk-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In order to better stratify and predict risk of prostate cancer progression, multiple clinicopathologic parameters have been investigated, and nomograms have been developed. While these are powerful tools, they have limitations. Advances over the last decade have dramatically increased both our understanding of prostate cancer biology and our ability to obtain molecular information from small amounts of prostate tissue. Along with these advances have come newly available and emerging clinical molecular tests, which promise to help determine prostate cancer prognosis and guide treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-risk-stratification-and-choice-of-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Current molecular tests that may better determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer have been developed either based on general features of malignancy (namely proliferation indices) or based on molecular features that are more specific for prostate cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101068\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101068 \">table 1</a>). These tests include those that are based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and those based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression. These tests, their possible clinical applications, and the literature supporting their use are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40176202\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTS BASED ON CELL PROLIFERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests based on cell proliferation include the evaluation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of Ki-67, a nuclear protein that is associated with ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, and the cell cycle progression (CCP) score assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which incorporates information from 31 cell cycle-related genes and 15 housekeeping genes.</p><p>Both Ki-67 IHC and the CCP score act as proxies for tumor proliferation. These tests have been employed in multiple retrospective cohorts, both with and without local treatment. Although they measure similar biological processes, they have not been directly compared; however, data for both tests appear similar.</p><p>Among low-risk, untreated populations (particularly those being counselled for active surveillance), few low- or very-low-risk patients will have tumors with high proliferation indices, with a contemporary analysis demonstrating CCP scores above 1 in roughly 8 percent of low-risk men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This may have been suspected, given the long natural history of low-grade prostate cancer.</p><p>Among populations typically undergoing definitive treatment, use of proliferation indices might be able to provide valuable information that could influence the extent of therapy (short versus long courses of androgen deprivation combined with radiation therapy, for instance, or the use of adjuvant radiation therapy after surgery). Head-to-head comparisons and cost-benefit analyses are needed to compare Ki-67 with CCP and will hopefully be forthcoming, particularly given that Ki-67 IHC is relatively inexpensive. While it is important to perform such studies, a study in breast cancer found marked heterogeneity in comparing Ki-67 results across centers, which limited its clinical utility, and thus, the CCP score may have an advantage due to its performance in a standard reference laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40176749\"><span class=\"h2\">Ki-67 immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that is associated with ribosomal RNA synthesis and may be necessary for cell cycle proliferation. Antibodies directed against Ki-67 can be used to perform IHC on routinely stored formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. The MIB-1 antibody is used most commonly. Typically, the amount of Ki-67 staining is reported as a percent of the total cell population, which stains positive for Ki-67. </p><p>The Ki-67 staining has consistently demonstrated prognostic value and has been tested in men managed with radiation and surgery, as well as in those conservatively managed without definitive therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one group of studies, pretreatment biopsies of patients undergoing radiation and androgen deprivation as part of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 92-02 trial were analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A dichotomous cut off for Ki-67 staining was set at less than or greater than 7.1 percent. Ki-67 staining greater than 7.1 percent significantly correlated with distant metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality. The same associations held when Ki-67 staining was treated as a continuous variable on multivariable analysis, and data suggested that a cut point higher than 7.1 percent might be more informative. This was demonstrated in a follow-up study using a cut point for staining of 11.3 percent, with high Ki-67 staining being independently correlated with an increase in distant metastasis, cancer-specific death, and overall death, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.95, 2.35, and 1.44, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ki-67 was more predictive than MDM2 and P53 in this patient cohort, with combinations of high Ki-67 and high MDM2 staining by IHC being associated with even greater HRs for poor outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ki-67 IHC has also been studied in pretreatment biopsies prior to prostatectomy, as well as in prostatectomy tissue of men undergoing treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A study from the Mayo clinic explored Ki-67 staining in pretreatment biopsies prior to radical prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A cut off of 6 percent staining was used when dichotomizing Ki-67 staining. Of the 445 men analyzed, 11 percent had high Ki-67 staining, and high staining was associated with increased risks of cancer progression and cancer-specific mortality. Ki-67 staining was an independent predictor of these outcomes on multivariable analysis and added value to D&rsquo;Amico and Kattan nomograms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When analyzed on prostatectomy specimens from treated men, Ki-67 has showed similar prognostic ability, with HRs of 1.5 to 4.4 in multivariable analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The range of HRs is reflective of a lack of uniformity in regards to an optimal staining cut off, the methods by which Ki-67 staining is quantitated, and differences in the overall risk of the studied populations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ki-67 has been examined by the Transatlantic Prostate Group in needle biopsies from conservatively managed prostate cancer patients in Great Britain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This cohort contained 243 analyzable cases of men diagnosed largely prior to widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in Great Britain (1990 to 1996) who had long clinical follow-up (median of nine years). During follow-up, men were not treated with either radiation or surgery. Ki-67 staining was dichotomized to separate those with &lt;10 percent versus those with &gt;10 percent staining since the survivals of men with Ki-67 staining &lt;5 percent and those with staining between 5 and 10 percent of cells were similar. Using this cut point, only 5 percent of the population had high Ki-67 staining on their biopsies. For men with high Ki-67 staining, however, there was significantly greater prostate cancer mortality, with an HR of 2.8 on multivariable analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Only one man with a Gleason sum of &lt;7 had a Ki-67 staining of &gt;10 percent, so analysis of this subset was not possible. Importantly, contemporary active surveillance populations are comprised primarily of men with Gleason sum 6 disease. This highlights an important potential limitation of Ki-67 staining, in that most men diagnosed with low-risk disease will have low Ki-67 levels, suggesting that there may be a low utility in men who are deciding between immediate and deferred local treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Active surveillance for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40176755\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell cycle progression score (Prolaris)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within the last decade, the ability to perform molecular analysis on small amounts of fresh-frozen FFPE tissue has become routine. Based upon this technology, a test that analyzes 31 cell cycle related genes and 15 housekeeping genes by quantitative RT-PCR has been developed (Prolaris test, Myriad). This can be used on biopsy or prostatectomy tissue. This test yields a proliferative index, expressed as a CCP score, and yields highly reproducible results. Like Ki-67, the CCP score has been tested in multiple clinical cohorts with known outcomes and has been successfully performed on biopsy, transurethral resection, and prostatectomy tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p>The Transatlantic Prostate Group examined CCP scores using needle biopsies of a conservatively managed prostate cancer cohort from Great Britain (an overlapping cohort with that described above for Ki-67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Of 349 analyzable men, median CCP score was 1.03, with an interquartile range from 0.41 to 1.74. In this cohort managed without primary treatment, the cumulative incidence of death was increased among those with CCP scores &gt;2 (19 percent of the population) compared with those with lower CCP scores. Patient outcomes could not be well differentiated in those with lower CCP scores (between 1 and 2, 0 and 1, or &lt;0). On multivariable analysis, the HR of prostate cancer death was 1.7 per unit increase in CCP score (which represents a doubling in cell cycle gene expression). Similar results were reported in an update of this conservatively managed cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A multi-institutional retrospective study to analyze CCP scores from biopsy tissue was also undertaken for men undergoing radical prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. On multivariable analysis, CCP score was independently associated with biochemical PSA recurrence and metastasis (HR 1.47 and 4.19, respectively, per unit score increase, p &lt;0.05 for both) after surgery. There were relatively few cases of metastasis in this cohort, again with men having biopsy CCP scores &gt;2 (2.4 percent of the study population) having the worst metastatic outcomes, and subgroups of men having lower CCP scores all having similar, high metastasis-free survival rates. In addition to studying populations treated by surgery, CCP scores have also been evaluated for their ability to predict biochemical failure following radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Here, multivariable analysis again showed that CCP score increases were associated with worse outcomes (HR of 2.1 per unit increase in score, p = 0.03).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40176767\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTS BASED ON MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased understanding of prostate cancer biology has led to the development of molecular tests that are more specifically tailored to prostate cancer. In addition, an expanded ability to utilize fresh-frozen formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue has allowed for the genome-wide assessment of expression through ribonucleic acid (RNA) profiling to determine markers specific to prostate cancer prognosis.</p><p>Loss of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor appears to be both biologically relevant as well as clinically prognostic as a marker in untreated, localized prostate cancer. Further immunohistochemical evaluation of PTEN in men diagnosed by needle biopsy is needed before adoption as a clinical test in populations considering surveillance. PTEN loss may also be useful as a prognostic marker in men who have undergone treatment of their disease.</p><p>Oncotype Dx Prostate, Promark, and Decipher are multimarker tests that, similar to PTEN, are more specific to prostate cancer. Oncotype Dx Prostate and Promark are developed for the prediction of the presence of adverse pathology. Decipher appears to have utility in predicting metastasis and death following prostatectomy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40176773\"><span class=\"h2\">PTEN loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate cancer is characterized by a large amount of genomic complexity, with chromosomal copy number alterations (deletions and amplifications) being particularly common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A common, relatively early event in the clonal evolution of prostate cancer is the loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor on chromosome 10q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. PTEN normally functions to halt the <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/AKT</span> pathway, the activation of which leads to cell growth, survival, and motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Members of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/AKT</span> pathway are altered in up to 50 percent of all primary prostate cancer and virtually 100 percent of all metastatic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Reflective of its biological importance, PTEN deletion in mouse models leads to locally invasive prostate cancer and results in rapid progression to metastatic disease when combined with additional genomic alterations (such as the deletion of SMAD4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Using routinely collected tissue, PTEN loss can be measured at the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and at the expression level through immunohistochemistry (IHC). The Transatlantic Prostate Group has evaluated PTEN loss by both IHC and FISH in a group of conservatively managed men with localized prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Performance characteristics were most favorable when PTEN was evaluated by IHC (perhaps because IHC can detect loss of PTEN protein expression whether due to chromosomal loss or gene silencing).</p><p>In total, 18 percent of this cohort had PTEN loss by IHC. Perhaps correlating with its biology as an early molecular event, PTEN loss was highly predictive of prostate cancer mortality in men with low-risk characteristics (those with low Gleason score, low prostate-specific antigen [PSA], low Ki-67 staining, and low extent of disease, hazard ratio [HR] of prostate cancer death of 7.4, p = 0.012 in these men and 8.13 among men with Gleason sums less than 7). In contrast, PTEN loss did not correlate with prognosis in higher risk men. This indicates that IHC identifying PTEN loss, as opposed to cell cycle proliferation indices, may have an important clinical role for determining which low-risk men are inappropriate candidates for deferred treatment of their localized prostate cancer. Importantly, the Transatlantic Prostate Group PTEN IHC study was performed on prostate specimens from transurethral resection and should be confirmed in a more clinically relevant needle biopsy cohort.</p><p>The data regarding the independent prognostic ability of PTEN loss in posttreatment scenarios have been more conflicting. This could be due to the high frequency of PTEN pathway disruption in men who have received active treatment and the high correlation between PTEN loss and clinicopathologic factors, such as Gleason grade and pathologic stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Indeed, in one series of close to 400 patients studied by PTEN IHC, PTEN loss was a significant determinant of future metastasis and death after prostatectomy in univariate analysis but lost significance on multivariable analysis that incorporated stage, grade, and surgical margin status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast, using the same staining protocols in a higher risk population (all Gleason sum 7 to 10) receiving adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> following prostatectomy, PTEN loss, high MYC expression, and increasing Ki-67 staining were all found to be independent predictors of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. PTEN homozygous loss has also been shown to be independently predictive of biochemical recurrence when assayed by FISH in radical prostatectomy series that are at high risk of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>In addition to its use as a singular marker, PTEN loss has been combined with assessment of ERG gene rearrangement in another prognostic panel test (ProstaVysion) and when examined with ERG gene IHC. ERG rearrangement status may add additional information about the prognostic significance of PTEN loss as men with PTEN loss and no ERG rearrangement are at elevated risk for lethal prostate cancer after prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40176779\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostate cancer classifier (Decipher)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decipher (GenomeDx Biosciences) is a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments <span class=\"nowrap\">(CLIA)/College</span> of American Pathologist (CAP)-certified genome-wide microarray that encompasses 1.4 million probes assaying coding and noncoding RNAs. On this platform, expression signatures are developed, locked, validated, and calibrated. By comparing profiles of high-risk men with prostate cancer who developed rapid metastasis after prostatectomy with those of a matched cohort of men with favorable outcomes following surgery, a 22-marker prostate cancer classifier (PCC; also called the genomic classifier [GC]) was developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and subsequently validated in multiple series as an independent predictor of metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>].</p><p>The genome-wide expression array is run on tissue, and the PCC score is outputted (ranging from 0 to 1) based on the expression of these 22 markers. Published studies have utilized formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostatectomy and biopsy tissue from cohorts treated initially with surgery or radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/25-28,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28,31,32</a>]. </p><p>In a blinded validation study, the assay had independent predictive value on multivariable analysis for predicting metastasis following prostatectomy, with an HR of 1.5 for each 10 percent increase in score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When used as a categorical variable, PCC scores &gt;0.45 were associated with an increased risk of metastasis, with scores &gt;0.6 placing men at considerably higher risk for disease progression following local treatment. These results were validated in two separate prostatectomy cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>].</p><p>In addition to the prediction of metastasis after prostatectomy, the PCC has also been shown to be associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>] and progressive disease following adjuvant or salvage radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. A meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] showed a statistically significant association of high (&gt;0.6) versus low (&lt;0.45) PCC scores with an increased risk of distant metastasis, but not with an intermediate (0.45 to 0.6) as compared with low PCC score after adjusting for the use of adjuvant and salvage postradical prostatectomy treatments. </p><p>In a separate study, PCC scores &gt;0.6 independently predicted distant metastasis when compared with other clinical-pathological features available at prostatectomy (ie, Gleason score 8 to 10, seminal vesicle or lymph node invasion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Concurrent adjustments for clinical pathologic features, timing of&nbsp;adjuvant and salvage postprostatectomy therapies, and timing of scans to ascertain for metastatic disease&nbsp;in a single study would provide further strength to support the association of a PCC score &gt;0.6 and the risk of metastatic disease. Practitioners should also note that implementation of the genomic PCC score is most informative with inclusion of standard clinical and pathological features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In the biopsy setting, a study examined the PCC scores of 57 men treated with surgery and for whom long-term follow-up was available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The PCC was independently predictive of metastasis in multivariable analysis and increased the c-index for prediction of metastasis from 0.72 for National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories alone to 0.88 when combined with genomic testing. In another study of 100 men undergoing primary radiation therapy for prostate cancer, only the PCC score was predictive of clinical progression in multivariable analysis including the genomic score and clinical pathological variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In addition to prognostic genomic signatures, the genome-wide information available from this testing has allowed for the development of signatures that may be predictive of treatment response. For instance, the 24-gene Post-Operative Radiation Therapy Outcome Score (PORTOS) has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While this signature was not prognostic for metastatic progression following prostatectomy in men not receiving additional radiation therapy, men with high PORTOS scores had a roughly sevenfold decrease in metastasis if adjuvant or salvage radiation was employed. While signatures such as PORTOS will require additional validation before they are employed in clinical use, predictive signatures such as these will likely have the greatest impact on clinical decision-making in men whose clinical indices do not already indicate a very high or very low risk of metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40176785\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer gene panel (Oncotype DX prostate)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer is often identified in low-volume needle biopsy specimens. In order to molecularly evaluate small volumes of FFPE cancer tissue from needle biopsies, an assay has been developed using quantitative RT-PCR (Oncotype DX Prostate test, Genomic Health).</p><p>This assay incorporates 12 cancer genes that represent four biological pathways of prostate cancer oncogenesis, including the androgen receptor pathway, pathways of cellular organization, stromal response, and proliferation, along with five reference genes. </p><p>This assay was developed based upon results from studies using both prostatectomy and biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It was then evaluated in a prospective validation study of 395 men who had low-risk or low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer and met institutional criteria for active surveillance. Results with the assay were then correlated with findings from the prostatectomy specimens. At prostatectomy, 123 patients had high-grade or nonprostate-confined disease. Each 20-point increase in the genomic prostate score (GPS) was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of high-grade <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-organ-confined disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9).</p><p>In a second study, biopsy samples from 431 men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer were analyzed for the prognostic impact of the GPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. On multivariate analysis, the GPS was the only significant predictor of a biochemical relapse-free interval after adjustment for baseline clinical characteristics. In addition, the GPS was associated with adverse pathologic features at subsequent radical prostatectomy. This study was combined with the results above in a meta-analysis of the 732 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Here, the GPS was shown to modulate the risk of adverse pathological features at prostatectomy across Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) and NCCN risk subgroups.</p><p>In a retrospective study, the long-term impact of GPS was analyzed in 279 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A higher GPS was associated with shorter time to death from prostate cancer and shorter time to the development of metastases, in addition to its impact on worse biochemical relapse-free survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589216969\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteomic biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative approach to identifying specific abnormal genes in a biopsy specimen uses protein expression as a biomarker to supplement the prognostic information from the biopsy specimen histopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. An eight biomarker assay (ProMark) was developed in a study of 381 patient biopsies. This biomarker assay was then validated in a second blinded study of 276 cases, 94 percent of whom had a biopsy Gleason score of 3+3 or 3+4. The results of the biomarker assay were then compared with the Gleason score from the prostatectomy specimen.</p><p>In the validation study, the biomarker assay further improved the accuracy of the biopsy Gleason score in predicting either favorable or unfavorable pathology from the prostatectomy specimen. Additional studies are required to understand the role of this proteomic assay compared with other molecular prognostic tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40176827\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple molecular prognostic tests are emerging, specifically with an aim to better risk stratify both untreated and treated men with localized prostate cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101068\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101068 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies involving retrospective analysis of tissue from cohorts with clinical outcomes exist for some of these tests, including Ki-67 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) immunohistochemistry, and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based tests, such as the cell cycle progression score (Prolaris), genomic prostate score (Oncotype Dx Prostate), and the genomic classifier (Decipher). Although associated with an increased risk of clinical endpoints, including metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality, future validation would be recommended to substantiate these observations, given the relatively small number of events. This is particularly relevant for Oncotype DX, which has only been linked with metastasis in one study, with only five events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The current data suggest that molecular tests can add additional, independent prognostic information that may aid in risk stratification of localized prostate cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As new molecular tests emerge, head-to-head comparisons across multiple different patient populations (eg, low-risk men pretreatment considering active surveillance, men undergoing treatment, posttreatment, etc.) with specifically-designed clinically relevant endpoints should be undertaken, taking into account both relative effectiveness and cost.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to note that molecular prognostic studies are highly dependent on the tissue collected, particularly in the pretreatment setting or when extirpative treatment is not planned. The advent of improved imaging modalities, including multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with apparent diffusion coefficient, provides an opportunity to potentially identify the most aggressive areas of prostate cancer and allows for targeted biopsies to be utilized for molecular determinants of biologic aggressiveness. As the data mature, these techniques may help meet the promise of functional assessment of prostate cancer, reducing the issue of over-treatment or under-treatment.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Tosoian JJ, Chappidi MR, Bishoff JT, et al.
