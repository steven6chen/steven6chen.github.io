By definition, symptoms of short-term insomnia are present for less than three months, but they are accompanied by significant concern. Symptoms may be temporally related to an identifiable stressor. When a condition such as acute pain, grief or other stressor is the sole cause of the sleep difficulty, however, a separate insomnia diagnosis may not apply. The primary factor in the diagnosis of short-term insomnia is whether the sleep disorder becomes an independent focus for the patient. Short-term insomnia is expected to resolve when the stressor resolves or when the individual adapts to the stressor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic insomnia </strong>&ndash; Chronic insomnia subsumes alternate or historical terms including primary insomnia, secondary insomnia, and comorbid insomnia. Symptoms occur at least three times per week for three months or more and are not related to an inadequate opportunity for sleep (not related to sleep restriction) or an inappropriate sleep environment, or another sleep disorder. In some cases, patients who report repeated episodes of insomnia that occur for weeks at a time over years may be diagnosed with chronic insomnia, even if the individual episodes do not last for a full three months. Insomnia should include either a sleep latency of 20 minutes or more in children and young adults or 30 minutes or more in older adults; or wake periods of 20 minutes or more in children or young adults or 30 minutes or more in older adults. Complaints of early morning awakening are substantiated by termination of sleep at least 30 minutes prior to the desired time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other insomnia</strong> &ndash; Other insomnia is used for patients who complain of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep but do not meet all of the criteria for either short-term or chronic insomnia.</p><p/><p>Unlike prior editions of the ICSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the ICSD-3 classification system no longer contains subclassifications for chronic insomnia (ie, psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, inadequate sleep hygiene, and paradoxical insomnia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These subtypes were eliminated because they were not felt to be reliably reproducible in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia is one of the most common medical complaints, generating over five million office visits per year in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Prevalence estimates vary according to the study design and definition of insomnia used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A survey of primary care patients found that 69 percent had insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The insomnia was reported as occasional by 50 percent and chronic by 19 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A national survey of noninstitutionalized adults found that 35 percent reported insomnia during the course of the previous year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nearly half described the insomnia as serious.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of 50 studies found that approximately 10 percent of individuals develop chronic insomnia with related daytime consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>The prevalence of insomnia increases with age. In one study of elderly individuals, 57 percent had complaints consistent with insomnia and only 12 percent reported normal sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Late-life insomnia is often persistent and may prompt self-medication with over-the-counter sleep aids or alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Adult women report insomnia about 50 percent more often than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Up to 50 percent of women report sleep disturbances and insomnia during the menopausal transition, related in part to hot flashes and night sweats. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes#H17657079\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;, section on 'Effect on sleep'</a>.)</p><p>There is also a higher prevalence of insomnia among persons who are unemployed, divorced, widowed, separated, or of lower socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Insomnia comorbid with a psychiatric disorder is the most common diagnosis for patients with insomnia who are seen in a sleep center, occurring in about 3 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Insomnia comorbid with substance abuse is estimated to occur in about 0.2 percent of the general population, while insomnia comorbid with a medical condition is estimated to occur in about 0.5 percent of the general population. The latter occurs in a much higher proportion in certain clinical populations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Comorbidities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that 7 percent of adults develop insomnia each year and 30 percent develop some symptoms of insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Insomnia may be more common among individuals with a physiological or psychological vulnerability to insomnia. Variables associated with the onset of insomnia include a previous episode of insomnia, a family history of insomnia, a predisposition toward being more easily aroused from sleep, poorer self-rated health, more body pain and trait sleep reactivity (ie, the propensity for exaggerated sleep disruption in response to stressful events) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with insomnia typically complain about difficulty falling asleep <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> staying asleep. They may also describe variable sleep, such as one or several nights of poor sleep followed by a night of better sleep. Impaired daytime function must also be reported for a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder. In many cases, comorbid psychiatric or medical disorders, medications or substances, or other sleep disorders are also present. The clinical features of insomnia are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults#H2311471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia can be confused with short duration sleep, circadian rhythm disorders, chronic sleep restriction (insufficient sleep syndrome), or sleep-disruptive environmental circumstances but can be differentiated from each by a thorough history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults#H2311852\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians need to be alert to the possibility that a patient has insomnia, because only 30 percent of patients with insomnia spontaneously report their sleep problem to the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Insomnia is a clinical diagnosis. Therefore, a sleep history is the only diagnostic evaluation that is required to confirm or exclude insomnia. A medical history and physical examination should also be performed to determine whether the insomnia is associated with another condition, medication, or substance. Additional testing is guided by the history and physical examination but is not required in most patients. The diagnostic evaluation of insomnia is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral and pharmacologic therapies are available for insomnia. The management of insomnia is reviewed separately.

This section describes the sequelae associated with insomnia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with insomnia report increased fatigue, sleepiness, confusion, tension, anxiety, and depression compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Such dysphoria pervades other areas of life, causing patients with insomnia to report a decreased quality of life and degraded performance.</p><p>Patients with insomnia have decrements in both medical and emotional aspects of life, as determined by a standard measure of quality of life, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The magnitude of the impairment was similar to that seen in patients with a chronic medical condition (eg, heart failure) or depression.</p><p>Quality of life can also be measured by looking at employment measures, such as promotions and sick time. Patients with insomnia are less likely to receive promotions and more likely to have errors or accidents, to be absent from work, and to have more health-related consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. The poor work performance, increased medical issues, and increased emotional burden associated with insomnia increase costs to society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with insomnia are almost universally concerned that their poor sleep has negative consequences on their performance of daily tasks and consistently report subjective performance deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, patients with insomnia tend to overestimate the magnitude of the performance deficit, just as they tend to overestimate the magnitude of their sleep deficits.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 24 studies found small differences in episodic memory, problem solving, and working memory in patients with insomnia compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. No differences were found in general cognitive function, perceptual and psychomotor processes, procedural learning, verbal functions, attention (including alertness, reaction time, selective or sustained attention), and executive function (verbal fluency or cognitive flexibility).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5982679\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not receive treatment from their physician for insomnia frequently seek over-the-counter remedies and have an increased risk of substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In untreated insomnia patients, 28 percent have tried alcohol as a treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and insomnia patients in general show a preference to self-administer alcohol at bedtime compared with normal sleepers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Alcohol may reduce sleep latency in the short term, but is likely to cause fragmented sleep or early morning awakening. It also has significant risks for exacerbating insomnia in the long term in addition to other morbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risky-drinking-and-alcohol-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiological activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic insomnia, even not comorbid with other psychiatric or medical problem, is associated with physiological activation. A majority of studies have found increases in measures of physiological activation, including cardiac, metabolic, hormone, and high frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Studies have shown increased activity during sleep in hypothalamic areas and occasional reduced hippocampal volume in patients with insomnia compared to controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidities and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia is associated with sympathetic nervous system activation, and a number of studies have shown an association between insomnia and elevated cardiovascular risk, including hypertension and myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-33</a>]. In particular, decreased objective total sleep time has been associated with increased risk for incident hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and patients with insomnia have been observed to have a non-dipping blood pressure pattern at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] that can improve with insomnia treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Several observational studies have shown an increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease in patients with insomnia, even after adjusting for potential confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Patients with insomnia and short nocturnal sleep time are at increased risk for diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and treatment of insomnia in patients with diabetes has improved both sleep efficiency and glycemic control as measured by HbA1c in at least one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>There is a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and depression and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Insomnia is a strong predictor of the development of psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and drug abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/22,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,41</a>]. Among patients with both insomnia and a mood disorder, approximately one-third developed insomnia prior to the mood disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Similarly, a majority of alcoholics report sleeping problems prior to their alcohol dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Insomnia is highly predictive of relapse in both depression and alcohol dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], and depression improves more rapidly in patients with insomnia and depression when both the insomnia and depression are treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia is often a persistent or recurrent condition. This was best illustrated by an observational study of 388 adults with insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The study found that insomnia lasted at least one year in 74 percent of the adults and at least three years in 46 percent. It was most likely to persist in women, older adults, and those with severe insomnia. The insomnia resolved in 54 percent of the adults, but eventually returned in 27 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3510154054\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
