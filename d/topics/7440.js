Fractures of the calcaneus, cuboid, navicular, cuneiform, or tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) region are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. However, as more children and adolescents have become users of motorized recreational vehicles (eg, mini scooters, motorized dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles, snowmobiles) or have participated in snowboarding, the frequency and severity of these foot injuries has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The foot is divided into three regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78924%7EEM%2F61079%7EEM%2F71857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 graphicRef61079 graphicRef71857 \">figure 1A-C</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Forefoot</strong> &ndash; Metatarsal and phalangeal bones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Midfoot</strong> &ndash; Navicular, cuboid, and cuneiform bones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hindfoot</strong> &ndash; Talus and calcaneus</p><p/><p>The Lisfranc joint separates the forefoot from the midfoot. The Chopart joint divides the hindfoot and the midfoot.</p><p>The pediatric midfoot and hindfoot differ from the adult foot due to the presence of large portions of growing cartilage in the young child (under four years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The calcaneus and talus are ossified at birth, and the cuboid ossification center appears at birth or shortly thereafter. The navicular tarsal bone appears around three years of age and is the last of the large tarsal bones to develop a primary ossification center. Thus, a foot radiograph of a child under five years of age lacks significant areas of visible bone. These factors lead to patterns of injuries in young children that may be difficult to identify on plain radiographs and that differ from those in adults.</p><p>In contrast, the midfoot and hindfoot of adolescents have enough skeletal maturity that they develop fracture patterns that are similar to those seen in adults.</p><p>The high cartilage to bone ratio in children under age eight years permits significant remodeling of foot fractures and provides for good long-term outcomes in many instances. However, fractures of the talar neck in children, although rare, may disrupt the vascular supply of the talus and cause avascular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific fractures of the mid- or hindfoot are associated with certain types of injury patterns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Talar neck</strong> fractures often result from forced dorsiflexion of the foot during a fall or motor vehicle collision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fractures of the lateral process of the talus</strong> are associated with snowboarding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcaneus fractures</strong> may occur after trivial falls in toddlers and young children.

In rare instances, comparison views with the uninjured foot may be helpful in identifying subtle fractures. </p><p>Additional views should be based on clinical findings that suggest the area of fracture (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Talus</strong> &ndash; Fractures of the talus include fractures of the neck, body, medial or lateral process, and osteochondral injuries. Among these, talar neck fractures are most common and are described using the Hawkins classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53096 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65869\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65869 \">image 1</a>). Computed tomography should be included in the radiographic series in a patient with significant lateral foot pain with negative plain radiographs, since fractures of the lateral process of the talus are sometimes occult and radiographs are negative in over 40 percent of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcaneus</strong> &ndash; Axial views of the foot should be added to the standard series in patients with suspected calcaneus fractures. However, a low threshold for computed tomography should be maintained since up to 50 percent of pediatric calcaneal fractures are initially missed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66449\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66449 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77701\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77701 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most calcaneus fractures in children heal uneventfully; although fractures with significant intraarticular involvement and displacement can yield poorer results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65868\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65868 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Midfoot fractures</strong> &ndash; Most isolated midfoot fractures affect the cuboid (outer aspect of the midfoot) or navicular bones (inner aspect of the midfoot) and consist of minor avulsion or stress fractures. Initial plain radiographs may be normal in children with stress fractures. Repeat films in one to two weeks usually show a sclerotic line of healing. Bone scan will not change the clinical management despite a positive study and is almost never ordered.<br/><br/>Complete fractures of the midfoot typically occur after high force complex foot injuries and are associated with other fractures, especially tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) fractures. Compression fracture of the cuboid (&quot;nutcracker&quot; fracture) is associated with horseback riding.<br/><br/>K&ouml;hler disease, an apophysitis of the tarsal navicular, is an uncommon cause of limp in children between the ages of two and nine years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64819\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64819 \">image 4</a>).

The most common pediatric injury consists of medial dislocation (first metatarsal displaced from first cuneiform bone) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52617\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52617 \">image 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talar fractures, intraarticular calcaneus fractures, and tarsometatarsal <span class=\"nowrap\">fractures/dislocations</span> are the most common indications for computed tomography (CT) of the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54662\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54662 \">figure 5</a>). With these fractures, CT can provide the primary diagnosis for initial management in the emergency department and provides key information if the need for later operative repair is anticipated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of foot injuries is rarely performed as part of the acute evaluation because the information typically does not change initial management. MRI may be useful in children whose radiographic imaging remains normal but whose recovery from injury is prolonged and is especially helpful in detecting osteochondral abnormalities in young children. MRI can also be used to monitor vascularity in children with talar neck fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should obtain emergent orthopedic consultation in the patients with the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Open fractures</strong> &ndash; These injuries usually involve a motor vehicle collision or are machine-related, often involving a lawn mower, chainsaw, or heavy weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with open fractures should be managed in accordance with the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS), including a thorough examination of the entire lower extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Open fractures are frequently grossly contaminated wounds and should be treated with empiric parenteral antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefazolin</a>, or, in regions with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a>, depending upon local resistance patterns.

Pallor, paresthesias, and pulselessness are late signs. Emergent orthopedic consultation is indicated. Once the clinician suspects an acute compartment syndrome, compartment pressures must be measured to determine whether they are elevated, or a clinical decision to perform a fasciotomy is needed.

However, a minimally displaced talar neck fracture (&lt;5 mm) or lateral process of the talus fracture is typically immobilized using a short leg posterior splint or short leg cast with orthopedic follow-up in five to seven days. Subsequently, these fractures are treated in a long leg plaster cast for six to eight weeks. Fewer than 5 mm of displacement and fewer than five degrees of malalignment on anterior-posterior (AP) view are acceptable because the talus has good remodeling potential in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Nondisplaced lateral process talus fractures are treated with immobilization and non-weight bearing for four to six weeks.</p><p>Displaced talar neck or lateral process fractures typically require open reduction and internal fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/3,6,8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,8,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcaneal fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of these fractures are extraarticular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66449\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66449 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77701\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77701 \">image 3</a>) and usually heal well with immobilization alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-fractures-other-than-metatarsal-or-phalangeal-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

A foot fracture, particularly one sustained in a fall from a height, may mask other injuries, especially spinal column compression fractures. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have sustained major trauma warrant a complete physical examination and appropriate ancillary studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 2</a>). A complete evaluation of the entire lower extremity should be conducted before assuming that the injury is confined to the foot, especially in a child who is less than five years of age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> is nonverbal. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency conditions, such as an open fracture, neurovascular compromise, or compartment syndrome require prompt recognition and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Emergency conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with isolated fractures of the midfoot and hindfoot are unable to walk or have marked limitation of ambulation. Patterns of swelling and location of tenderness on palpation can assist in identifying the fracture site. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs, with anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and oblique views of the foot, remain the most appropriate initial imaging modality and suffice to diagnose most low energy injuries. In rare instances, comparison views with the uninjured foot may be helpful in identifying subtle fractures. An axial view is indicated for children with a suspected calcaneus fracture. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talar fractures, calcaneus fractures, and tarsometatarsal <span class=\"nowrap\">fractures/dislocations</span> are the most common indications for computed tomography (CT) of the foot. With these fractures, CT can provide the initial diagnosis and information for possible later operative repair. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should obtain emergency orthopedic consultation in patients with vascular compromise, compartment syndrome, or open fractures of the metatarsal bone or proximal phalanx. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Emergency conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with no signs of neurovascular compromise, initial therapy consists of analgesia and measures to reduce swelling and pain. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia and initial care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should obtain urgent orthopedic consultation, generally within one to two days, for children with any of the following foot fractures (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any talar neck fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intraarticular calcaneus fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tarsometatarsal fractures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondisplaced foot fractures may be treated with a posterior short leg splint or a short leg cast.
