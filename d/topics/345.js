The causes of TME are diverse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110254 \">table 1</a>). The presentation of this condition in the infant or child may be subtle and not easily recognized. Because TME often is reversible and interruption of neuronal activity in the developing brain can have a long-lasting effect, prompt recognition and treatment are important.</p><p>An overview of the causes, clinical features, and an approach to the diagnostic evaluation and management of TME in children will be reviewed here. Neonatal encephalopathy is discussed separately.

The term is <strong>not</strong> used to describe cerebral dysfunction due to primary brain disease, including structural pathology (eg, tumor, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus), central nervous system infection (eg, meningitis, encephalitis), or immune-mediated inflammation (eg, autoimmune encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All forms of TME interfere with the function of the ascending reticular activating system <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its projections to the cerebral cortex, thus leading to impairment of arousal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> awareness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal neuronal activity requires a balanced environment of electrolytes, water, amino acids, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and metabolic substrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, normal blood flow, normal temperature, normal osmolality, and physiologic pH are required for optimal brain function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Complex systems, such as those mediating arousal and awareness and those involved in higher cognitive functions, are more likely to malfunction when the local milieu is deranged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Despite a wide array of pathophysiologic mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110254 \">table 1</a>), the clinical manifestations of acute TME tend to be very similar because of a common final mechanism: interruption of polysynaptic pathways and altered excitatory-inhibitory amino acid balance and cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2966690529\" class=\"local\">'Specific etiologies of encephalopathy'</a> below.)</p><p>The pathophysiology of acute TME usually is multifactorial and varies according to etiology. TME generally results from neuroinflammation, cytotoxic injury, or disruption of neurotransmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Neuroinflammation in TME results from alterations in central nervous system homeostasis that activate microglial cells and infiltrating myeloid cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This process releases cytokines that have independent neurotoxic effects and also disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Loss of the tight junction of the BBB results in extravasation of protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and facilitates vasogenic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Causes of cytotoxic injury include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disruption of energy production by inadequate cerebral blood flow, or lack of oxygen or glucose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuronal injury caused by exogenous drugs or toxins, or endogenous toxins that result from systemic infections (eg, lipopolysaccharide), neurotoxic cascade (eg, glutamate release, calcium homeostasis), inadequate removal of wastes by the liver or kidney or an inborn error of metabolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral edema or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which may further compromise cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Causes of disrupted neurotransmission may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte disturbances that affect the electrical properties of cellular membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endogenous or exogenous toxins or drugs that disrupt membrane polarization or interfere with neuronal activity by affecting neurotransmitters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disturbed BBB leading to the accumulation of systemic toxins as well as normal plasma constituents in the brain or CSF that interfere with neuronal function.

Some syndromes of TME are relatively restricted to certain age ranges. For example, severe metabolic encephalopathies are more often seen in infants and young children whereas alcohol intoxication is more often seen in adolescents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1317687081\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) often is a straightforward diagnosis after an obvious precipitating event such as drowning, airway obstruction, or cardiopulmonary arrest. Hypoxic-ischemic events that occur antenatally, perinatally, or postnatally are a common cause of encephalopathy in newborns. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of HIE include severe hypotension caused by massive hemorrhage or cardiac arrhythmias or hypoxemia caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. The duration and severity of hypoxia or hypotension and the patient's preexisting neurologic status strongly influence the degree of neurologic insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Although potentially reversible, the syndrome can exert long-term cognitive impairments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In patients with systemic infection or sepsis, encephalopathy may result from hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion (ie, septic shock) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> from the effects of host's immune response and alterations of the blood-brain barrier. Encephalopathy can occur in patients who are hypotensive and in those who are normotensive. Clinical manifestations of SAE are typically non-focal; mental status derangements range from mild (eg, attentional impairments or disorientation) to severe (eg, coma). Less well studied in children, SAE in adults may present as an excitable state (agitation, irritability, confusion, delirium) or a depressed state (lethargy, obtundation or coma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings, although nonspecific, tend to reflect increasing severity of SAE in the following order: normal, theta, delta, and triphasic waves and burst suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Burst suppression associated with SAE is often reversible and generally portends less severe outcomes than that seen in other settings (eg, HIE).

The most common cause is ketotic hypoglycemia, which typically occurs after a mild infectious illness in thin, undernourished young children, and leads to vomiting, encephalopathy, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other causes of hypoglycemia include excessive insulin administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], hepatitis, ethanol ingestion, and inborn errors of metabolism (eg, glycogen storage disorders, defects in gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation defects). Other relatively uncommon but important etiologies are endocrinopathies (eg, growth hormone or cortisol deficiency), Reye and Reye-like syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and insulin-secreting pancreatic tumors.

Neurologic signs can range from confusion or delirium to coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Focal or generalized seizures can occur, and focal deficits may suggest a stroke. Signs of increased epinephrine release (eg, tremor, diaphoresis) may occur but are not universal. Because hypoglycemia has such a wide range of manifestations, blood glucose concentrations should be measured in any patient with acute neurologic dysfunction. Prompt treatment of low glucose levels with intravenous glucose generally will reverse the neurologic signs, although prolonged or recurrent episodes may result in persistent deficits.

Affected children typically have nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, deep and labored hyperventilation (Kussmaul breathing), and altered levels of consciousness ranging from lethargy to coma. Treatment includes volume repletion and insulin administration.

Children and adolescents with type 2 DM may also present with a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). HHS differs from DKA in that ketoacidosis is absent or mild and the degree of dehydration is usually more profound. Mental obtundation and coma are more frequent in HHS than DKA because of the usually greater degree of hyperosmolality in HHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Laboratory abnormalities at presentation may include hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, lactic acidosis, or ketoacidosis, depending on the type of inborn error of metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76373 \">table 2</a>).

Causes include severe diarrhea, diabetes insipidus, and excessive sodium administration. Nonspecific initial manifestations of symptomatic hypernatremia include irritability, restlessness, weakness, vomiting, muscular twitching, fever, and, in infants, high-pitched cry and tachypnea. Encephalopathy is not typically seen until serum sodium level exceeds 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Because the most common cause of pediatric hypernatremia is excessive fluid losses, patients may also have manifestations of hypovolemia, including tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and poor peripheral perfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypernatremia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypernatremia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Encephalopathy associated with hypernatremia can result from the electrolyte disturbance itself or as a complication of its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Acutely, osmotic water loss from brain cells causes brain shrinkage that predisposes to focal bleeding, thrombosis, and infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In response to initial shrinkage, the brain adapts by taking up and producing organic osmolytes that promote water movement back into the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Because of this adaptation, and particularly where the evolution of the electrolyte imbalance has been relatively slow, neurologic symptoms are less likely to occur once the hypernatremia has been present for more than a few days. In patients with hypernatremia, rehydration should be performed cautiously. Rapid rehydration with hypotonic fluids may result in cerebral edema or pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis, leading to seizures, coma, or permanent neurologic deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

Common causes include gastrointestinal losses, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), cerebral salt wasting (CSW) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and water intoxication. CNS trauma, hemorrhage, or surgery (especially for sellar and suprasellar tumors) are often precipitants for SIADH or CSW resulting in hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Symptomatic hyponatremia manifests most commonly with neurologic dysfunction and is impacted more by the rate of change in sodium concentration than the absolute degree of hyponatremia. Neurologic symptoms are typically observed with plasma sodium levels &lt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and severe symptoms (lethargy, obtundation, and seizures) may occur as the level falls below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In response to initial brain swelling, the brain adapts by losing solutes, thereby leading to osmotic water movement out of the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, neurologic symptoms are less likely to occur once the hyponatremia has been present for more than a few days. Overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia can lead to a severe and sometimes irreversible osmotic demyelination syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>].

Symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">HTE/RPLS</span> include headache, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances; symptoms are generally transient and resolve when hypertension is treated effectively. RPLS is an acute encephalopathy characterized radiographically by cortical and white matter signal changes on T2 and flair magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F95041\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95041 \">image 1</a>). Lesions are hypo- or isointense on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), suggesting increased water diffusion due to vasogenic edema. MRI signal changes in HTE tend to be somewhat more occipital in location and more often associated with visual loss than RPLS. RPLS is correlated with level of hypertension and often occurs in patients with renal disease, uremia, preeclampsia, or eclampsia.

Causes of chronic hepatic failure include Wilson disease, biliary atresia, and chronic heart failure. In these conditions, excessive protein intake, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intercurrent infection can precipitate HE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessing pediatric HE is challenging, because children, especially infants, do not exhibit a clear gradation in severity as do adults. Because of these limitations, risk prediction in ALF relies more heavily on laboratory measures (eg, coagulation or ammonia level). HE, when present in ALF, confers a survival rate of only about 20 percent without transplantation. Seizures occur in about 20 percent of children with ALF. EEG abnormalities, including slowing, interictal spikes, and seizures, are associated with a poorer outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may be present in ALF without MRI correlate of edema. ICP monitoring may be helpful in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The pathogenesis of HE is uncertain. It may reflect a reversible metabolic encephalopathy, brain atrophy, brain edema, or any combination of these conditions. Cerebral edema has been ascribed to both cytotoxic edema from solute neurotoxicity (eg, ammonia, glutamine) and to breakdown of the BBB due to neuroinflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In advanced coma, the effects of brain swelling, impaired cerebral perfusion, and reversible impairment of neurotransmitter systems cannot be distinguished.

The specific cause of this disorder is uncertain. The severity of neurologic abnormalities may not correlate with the level of azotemia, suggesting that the encephalopathy does not depend exclusively upon the serum concentration of urea. Creatinine, guanidines, parathormone, and impaired oxygen utilization are thought to be responsible for some of the neurologic symptoms, including peripheral neuropathies.</p><p>Early clinical features of uremic encephalopathy include lethargy, irritability, disorientation, hallucinations, and rambling speech [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Coma occasionally occurs in acute renal failure. Most uremic patients have mild diffuse weakness or peripheral neuropathy and show unsteadiness in their movements. Tremor, myoclonus, and asterixis (&quot;uremic flap&quot;) are common occurrences and tend to vary in parallel with mental status. Tetany may be present, and focal or generalized seizures may occur.

Prompt recognition is crucial and the EEG is usually diagnostic if performed during the ictus. Unwitnessed seizures can result in a postictal state that mimics TME, in which case the EEG findings are likely to be generalized slowing and will not so readily indicate an epileptic origin. Findings include lethargy, confusion, agitation, and, at times, delirium. Resolution is observed within a few hours, especially if seizures are partial complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A rare prolonged postictal encephalopathy lasting 4 to 10 days has been described following prolonged or clusters of generalized seizures among patients with cognitive or structural abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Headache may not necessarily be present, but a family history of migraine usually is. Hemiplegic migraine is a rare mimic of TME. Individuals with hemiplegic migraine can develop a transient encephalopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coma following fever or minor trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Delirium is characterized by fluctuating levels of alertness and arousal, cognitive deficits, and disorganized behavior. The arousal state can alternate between hyperactive (ie, hypervigilance, agitation, hallucinations, and increased sympathetic outflow) and hypoactive (ie, depressed sensorium) states. Worsening brain dysfunction results in progressive disturbance of the level of consciousness from lethargy to obtundation, stupor, and coma. The initial presentation may be subtle and include shortened attention span, disorientation, disturbed cognitive function, and personality changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Abnormal movements, including myoclonic jerks, fine tremors, and asterixis (difficulty with postural maintenance, often seen as a coarse, flapping tremor of the hands) may occur. Primitive reflexes, such as suck or grasp responses, may be elicited on examination. Other common features include brisk deep tendon reflexes and extensor plantar responses.

However, when coupled to coma and loss of other brainstem functions (eg, dolls eyes, corneal reflex) the finding of poor pupillary response to light suggests severe <span class=\"nowrap\">anoxic/ischemic</span> damage from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or elevated intracranial pressure. The pupillary response is typically, although not invariably, preserved in other metabolic etiologies (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte derangements, inborn error of metabolism, liver or renal failure).

For patients who are stable, MRI should be performed as the initial imaging study if it can be obtained in a timely fashion. However, MRI requires a long period of immobility for optimal imaging and often requires <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/anesthesia</span>. For unstable patients in the acute setting, computed tomography (CT) is often obtained as the initial study because it is often more readily available, faster, and generally does not require <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/anesthesia</span>.

Patients with altered mental status such as confusion, obtundation, or coma should have an EEG to exclude non-convulsive status epilepticus, subclinical seizures and to assess severity of TME. In patients with overt seizures, the EEG will document epileptiform activity and characterize background activity.

Once an etiology is identified, specific treatment should be applied.</p><p>General measures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiopulmonary support</strong> &ndash; Patients who are unable to adequately protect their airway should be intubated and given appropriate ventilatory support. In patients with cardiovascular compromise, vasopressor therapy may be necessary. Maintenance of an appropriate systemic blood pressure is important to achieve adequate cerebral perfusion pressure.

The head of bed should be maintained at 30 degrees. Measurements of blood gas should be obtained to monitor ventilatory status, and metabolic status. Blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations should be assessed serially. Fluid input and output should be measured.

Hypovolemia (if present) should be addressed with appropriate volume expansion (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">20mL/kg</span> normal saline bolus). Subsequent fluid management generally consists of isotonic maintenance intravenous fluids to maintain euvolemia. Fluid restriction is not typically necessary unless there is an underlying condition that places the child at risk for hypervolemia (eg, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [SIADH], oliguric renal failure). Patients who have depressed mental status and those in whom airway reflexes are not intact are kept <em>nil per os </em>(NPO). Enteral feeding tubes are used to provide adequate nutrition in patients who are not able to feed by mouth.

The causes of TME are diverse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110254 \">table 1</a>). The presentation of this condition in the infant or child may be subtle and not easily recognized. Because TME often is reversible and interruption of neuronal activity in the developing brain can have a long-lasting effect, prompt recognition and treatment are important. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite a wide array of pathophysiologic mechanisms, the clinical manifestations of TME tend to be very similar. Most clinical features of acute TME are nonspecific and do not reliably identify a particular etiology. Changes in mental status range from subtle cognitive difficulties to florid delirium. Motor abnormalities may include hypotonia or hypertonia, abnormal movements (myoclonic jerks, fine tremors, and asterixis), and generalized or focal seizures. Pupillary response and respiratory abnormalities depend on the underlying cause of the TME. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first goal of the diagnostic evaluation is to exclude conditions that can mimic TME, including intracranial hemorrhage, abusive head trauma, cerebral venous thrombosis, CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), mass lesions, hydrocephalus, non-convulsive seizures, immune-mediated <span class=\"nowrap\">encephalitis/encephalomyelitis,</span> and confusional migraine. (See <a href=\"#H3261017799\" class=\"local\">'Mimics of toxic-metabolic encephalopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with TME of uncertain etiology, the initial diagnostic evaluation includes routine blood and urine tests; lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure and appropriate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies; neuroimaging; and electroencephalography. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of acute TME depends upon the nature and extent of encephalopathy. Patients with severe encephalopathy (ie, those with seizures, cardiorespiratory compromise, coma, or severe neurologic compromise) should be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). General measures should be instituted immediately, regardless of the cause. Once an etiology is identified, specific treatment should be applied. General supportive care is largely aimed at preventing secondary brain injury and includes (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory support (eg, intubation and mechanical ventilation if warranted, avoiding hypoxia, avoiding hyper- or hypocarbia) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiovascular support (addressing hypovolemia if present, maintaining age-appropriate systolic blood pressure) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-shock-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of shock in children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintaining the head of bed at 30 degrees</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Control of fevers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-coma-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of coma in children&quot;, section on 'Temperature control'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoidance hypo- or hyperglycemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Control of seizures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of convulsive status epilepticus in children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387205407\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Edwin Myer, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Parke, JT.
