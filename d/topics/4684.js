Local recurrences and nodal metastases are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-management-of-local-recurrence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: Management of local recurrence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551933061\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In transit metastases are located within regional dermal and subdermal lymphatics prior to reaching the regional lymph nodes. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) defines in transit metastases as any skin or subcutaneous metastases that are more than 2 cm from the primary lesion but are not beyond the regional nodal basin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lesions occurring within 2 cm of the primary tumor are classified as satellite metastases. The distinction between satellite lesions and in transit metastases is not necessary from a clinical perspective since both represent a manifestation of intralymphatic disease. Satellite lesions and in transit metastases are grouped together and considered intralymphatic in the AJCC staging system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the eighth (2017) AJCC tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system, non-nodal regional disease is stratified by category according to the number of tumor-involved lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 \">table 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In transit metastases are differentiated from satellite lesions, which are skin or subcutaneous lesions within 2 cm of the primary tumor that are considered intralymphatic extensions of the primary mass. Despite this distinction, the tumor biology associated with satellite and in transit metastases is similar, and they are not considered as distinct entities for treatment or prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melanoma in transit metastases typically appear as erythematous nodules of variable size that may or may not be pigmented. Occasionally, the lesions are flat rather than nodular depending on their location in the epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous tissue.</p><p>Although in transit metastases typically are located between the primary site and the regional nodes, they may extend in a direction opposite to that of the closest regional nodal basin in patients with extensive disease. This manifestation presumably reflects tumor blockage of lymphatic channels and altered patterns of lymphatic flow. Uncontrolled tumor growth can result in coalescence of lesions and tumor ulceration.</p><p>For patients who present with in transit metastases, a careful clinical and imaging assessment is necessary to determine whether disseminated disease is also present.

Overall, in this series, 505 patients (4 percent) developed in transit metastases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In transit metastases were predominantly associated with thicker primary tumors; the incidence was 0.4 percent in those with primary tumors &lt;1 mm thick and 7.8 percent for primary melanomas &ge;1 mm thick.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median time to the development of in transit metastases after the diagnosis of the primary tumor was 18 months, and the median survival following the diagnosis of in transit metastases was 20 months.</p><p/><p>Other factors reported to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent in transit metastases include the presence of ulceration in the primary tumor, location of the primary on the lower extremity, lymphovascular invasion, and positive regional lymph nodes at presentation.</p><p>Multiple studies have provided evidence that lymphatic disruption from surgical management of the regional lymphatics is not an independent risk factor for in transit metastases or local recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>], although a possible risk had been suggested by earlier observational data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective series of 4412 patients with stage I or II melanoma, the incidence of in transit metastases was significantly higher in patients undergoing a wide local excision (WLE) plus elective lymph node dissection (ELND; 6.6 versus 3.4 and 3.6 percent for WLE without and with sentinel lymph node [SLN] biopsy, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the higher rate of such metastases in patients undergoing ELND was explained by differences in the patient characteristics, with those undergoing ELND having more high-risk features at presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 1395 patients with extremity melanoma who underwent lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy, 6.5 percent developed in transit recurrence at a mean follow-up of 3.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

There was no difference in the rate of local recurrence or in transit metastases.

The technique, while similar to that described for patients with primary melanoma, is not standardized (eg, how many in transit metastases to inject, whether or not to inject the site of the primary lesion, in transit metastases, or both). When SLN biopsy is performed, the most popular technique is to inject radiocolloid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blue dye around the most proximal in transit lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

How additional staging information from this procedure might influence patient management or eligibility for clinical trials should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board that has expertise in melanoma management. SLN biopsy may have its biggest role in patients with small volume in transit disease in whom positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT) shows no metastatic disease and where the potential treatment options range from simple excision through regional treatment to systemic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients without distant metastases, resection of single or multiple in transit metastases is the treatment of choice when technically feasible with an acceptable level of morbidity. For patients with a positive SLN biopsy, the decision to perform a completion lymph node dissection should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board to balance the need for additional prognostic information, clinical trial eligibility, and local basin tumor control with the lack of evidence supporting any survival advantage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the majority of patients will develop disseminated disease, a subset of those without distant metastases enjoy long-term relapse-free survival following surgery with a curative intent. As an example, in a study of 648 patients with locally recurrent melanoma at first relapse who underwent complete surgical resection, 124 (19 percent) had not relapsed at a median follow-up of eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The incidence rates for subsequent local recurrence, lymph node disease, and systemic metastases were 45, 34, and 17 percent, respectively. Truncal primary tumor location and shorter disease-free intervals were associated with poorer outcomes following locoregional disease recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even if distant metastases are present, locoregional disease control is an important issue for quality of life because of pain and wound complications from ulcerating tumors. In some cases, surgery may be indicated to reduce or delay the morbidity (bleeding, ulceration, pain) associated with progression of in transit disease.</p><p/><p>Sound clinical judgment is needed to assess the feasibility of resection for in transit metastases. Most patients who undergo resection will relapse, usually with additional in transit metastases. In most patients, the morbidity associated with excision of a few in transit metastases every 6 to 18 months is acceptable. However, an increased frequency of in transit melanoma relapses or a greater number of in transit nodules suggests that alternative regional or systemic treatments should be considered.</p><p>The surgical principles for treating in transit lesions differ from those for a primary melanoma. A histologically negative margin is adequate, and the wider margins that are used to treat primary melanomas are not indicated. Depending upon the size of the metastases and the proximity to the original excision, the surgical defect may not be amenable to primary closure and may require skin grafting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Positive resection margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with microscopically, but not grossly, positive margins following resection of in transit metastases, we recommend reresection to clear the surgical margins only in those with the most favorable tumor biology. Observation followed by resection of any recurrence that subsequently develops is an appropriate alternative. </p><p>There are no data that directly compare outcomes following reresection with observation for management of histologically positive margins. The benefit of reresection to achieve negative margins must be balanced against the morbidity of the procedure. Since the vast majority of these patients harbor additional occult metastases in regional lymphatic channels, the value of reresection to clear surgical margins is very limited.</p><p>Furthermore, although the goal of resection is to achieve histologically negative margins, microscopically positive margins are sometimes identified in the resection specimen. This does not necessarily mean that melanoma cells were left behind in the excision bed. Subcutaneous fat is loose tissue that is easily brushed aside during the process of inking the specimen, and the ink may have been inadvertently applied to the pseudocapsule of a completely excised in transit metastases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical excision is the treatment of choice when feasible, with regional chemotherapy using ILP or ILI reserved for unresectable recurrences. There are no randomized trials that examine regional chemotherapy delivered using hyperthermic ILP as compared to ILI, or comparing either regional chemotherapy treatment to surgical excision of in transit metastases alone or to newer systemic therapies with or without surgical excision. Some unresectable recurrences may be converted to resectable following a response to ILP or ILI therapy.</p><p>Responses to regional chemotherapy occur gradually, and maximal tumor regression is usually present within three months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51740 \">picture 1</a>). Patients who have a partial response at reassessment can undergo resection, if the disease is deemed resectable, or undergo a repeat regional chemotherapy treatment. Options for patients who progress include alternative regional chemotherapy regimens or systemic therapy.</p><p>Regional chemotherapy using ILP or ILI techniques allows the delivery of relatively high concentrations of cytotoxic agents to an involved extremity while avoiding systemic toxicity. Hyperthermic ILP is effective, but it is time and resource consuming, as well as toxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. ILI was developed as a simpler and less toxic technique to achieve high regional drug concentrations. </p><p>Both techniques are still in use, and institutional preferences for one technique over the other are generally related to the preferences of the melanoma team and surgeon experience with each of the procedures. As systemic therapies have improved, the number of patients with regionally confined in transit disease of the extremities that go straight to regional chemotherapy treatment has decreased. Given the variety of options now available for these patients, optimal sequencing of treatments is complex and not uniformly agreed upon. Multidisciplinary discussion of these patients is strongly encouraged.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Melphalan</a> is the standard drug for regional chemotherapy because of its rapid uptake by cells and because its mechanism of action is independent of the cell cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Other agents that have been utilized include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dactinomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dactinomycin</a>, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>, although no advantage from combining any of these agents with melphalan has been demonstrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated limb perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ILP surgically separates the vascular inflow and outflow of the affected extremity from that of the remainder of the body. Thus, high concentrations of drugs are circulated locally without exposing the rest of the body to the same level of toxicity. By excluding the liver and kidney from the perfusion circuit, drug metabolism is minimized, thus leading to sustained high concentrations of drug in the perfused limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Vascular isolation of the extremity is needed to avoid leakage of perfusate into the systemic circulation and of systemic blood into the perfusion circuit. A tourniquet is applied around the root of the extremity to occlude superficial veins that could communicate between the limb circuit and the remainder of the body.</p><p>The isolated extremity is usually subjected to mild hyperthermia (&le;40&ordm;C), which produces vasodilatation that is thought to improve antitumor effect while not subjecting the entire body to the risks of hyperthermia. Hyperthermia increases the regional toxicity of ILP, particularly with temperatures &ge;40&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although hyperthermic ILP increases response rates compared with historic controls, hyperthermia has not been demonstrated to have an effect on overall survival.</p><p>ILP of the lower extremities is most commonly performed via cannulation of the external iliac vessels; the axillary vessels are used in the arm. However, ILP can be performed via the femoral or popliteal vessels in the lower extremity, and via the brachial vessels in the arm in certain clinical situations, such as a redo perfusion or in an individual who has had a previous pelvic or axillary lymph node dissection. The vessels are cannulated and connected to the inflow and outflow lines of an extracorporeal bypass circuit identical to that used in cardiac surgery.</p><p>The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> is generally based upon the volume of the extremity (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> limb volume for lower extremity and 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> limb volume for upper extremity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The optimal duration of perfusion has not been studied critically, but most surgeons perfuse for 60 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated limb infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normothermic ILI has been developed as a more convenient and less invasive alternative for regional chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. With ILI, the artery and vein of an extremity are accessed percutaneously using high-flow catheters, and a pneumatic tourniquet is used proximally to isolate the extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65340 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>ILI differs from ILP in that ILI circulates blood in an isolated extremity at a much slower rate than ILP and for only 30 minutes, and hyperthermia is not achieved. During ILI, the extremity is hypoxic, which leads to marked acidosis. In contrast, with hyperthermic ILP, the pump oxygenator maintains the oxygenation and normal <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/base</span> status of the extremity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3029360677\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized clinical trials comparing ILP with ILI. The ILP procedure is more complicated and has been associated with more toxicity. &#160;</p><p>The outcomes with each approach are illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ILP &ndash; In a multicenter trial, 133 patients with melanoma in transit metastases were treated with standard hyperthermic ILP and randomly assigned to treatment using either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> or melphalan plus TNF-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The procedure was successfully completed in 124 cases (93 percent). There was no significant difference in efficacy with the two different treatment regimens. Overall, 76 patients (57 percent of the total study population) had a response, and 29 (22 percent) had a complete response. There were two amputations related to treatment but no treatment-related deaths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ILI &ndash; In the largest reported experience, the outcomes in 316 melanoma patients treated with ILI using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dactinomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dactinomycin</a>) were analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The overall response rate was 75 percent, and the complete response rate was 33 percent. There were no treatment-related amputations. Similar results were observed in a combined report of 157 patients who were treated with ILI from eight centers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Dactinomycin was added to the melphalan regimen in 93 percent of infusions. The overall response rate was 64 percent, including 31 percent complete responses, in the 128 evaluable patients. Grade 3 or greater toxicity was observed in 36 percent of cases, and one patient required an amputation because of toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ILP versus ILP &ndash; A combined analysis of the ILI experience from the Sydney Melanoma Unit, Duke, and the United States multicenter study compared outcomes with previously published reports using ILP. The overall response rate was higher with ILP than with ILI (79 percent in 294 patients versus 64 percent in 313 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The rate of complete response was 50 percent with ILP versus 33 percent with ILI. The overall incidence of grade 3 or greater toxicity was similar (29 versus 33 percent), but ILP resulted in more grade 5 toxicity (2.0 versus 0.3 percent). A similar difference in response rate and an absence of difference in overall survival have been observed in another retrospective analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p>Adjuvant systemic therapy may be considered for patients who achieve a complete response with regional chemotherapy alone or with regional chemotherapy followed by surgery.
