Clinical manifestations can include headache, papilledema, visual loss, focal or generalized seizures, focal neurologic deficits, confusion, altered consciousness, and coma.</p><p>Many cases have been linked to inherited and acquired thrombophilias, pregnancy, puerperium, infection, and malignancy. Infarctions due to CVT are often hemorrhagic and associated with vasogenic edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment, which is started as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, consists of reversing the underlying cause when known, control of seizures and intracranial hypertension, and antithrombotic therapy. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of acute and subacute treatment for CVT.</p><p>This topic will review the prognosis and treatment of CVT. Other aspects of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE ANTITHROMBOTIC TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the overall aim of treatment for CVT is to improve outcome, the immediate goals treatment for CVT are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To recanalize the occluded <span class=\"nowrap\">sinus/vein</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent the propagation of the thrombus, namely to the bridging cerebral veins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To treat the underlying prothrombotic state, in order to prevent venous thrombosis in other parts of the body, particularly pulmonary embolism, and to prevent the recurrence of CVT</p><p/><p>The main treatment option to achieve these goals is anticoagulation, using either heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), as discussed in the next section. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3037533753\"><span class=\"h2\">Early anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon available published data and guidelines, we recommend anticoagulation with subcutaneous LMWH or intravenous heparin for adults with symptomatic CVT who have no contraindication. The presence of hemorrhagic venous infarction is not a contraindication for anticoagulant treatment in CVT. The evidence summarized below (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below) suggests that subcutaneous LMWH is more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH), and is at least as safe. Therefore, we prefer subcutaneous LMWH unless the patient is clinically unstable, or invasive interventions such as lumbar puncture or surgery are planned, or there is a contraindication to LMWH, such as renal failure.</p><p>Treatment for children during the acute phase of CVT is similar to that for adults, but the evidence is weaker since there are no randomized controlled trials in this age group. </p><p>The duration of antithrombotic treatment is reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Long-term anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although definitive evidence of effectiveness is lacking, there is a general consensus that anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH is appropriate treatment for acute CVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, more than 80 percent of the patients in the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT) were treated with anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Two randomized controlled trials of anticoagulation in acute CVT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69484 \">table 1</a>) have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Both have methodologic problems, most importantly their modest sample size.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Berlin trial of intravenous heparin versus placebo was stopped prematurely because of excess mortality in the placebo arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients randomized to the heparin arm had significantly better outcomes on a nonvalidated composite CVT severity scale than those in the placebo group. The average length from onset of symptoms to anticoagulation treatment, four weeks, was exceptionally long [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Dutch trial of subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadroparin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadroparin</a> versus placebo enrolled 60 patients, but excluded those who needed lumbar punctures for the relief of increased intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. More patients treated with LMWH followed by oral anticoagulation had a favorable outcome than controls, but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69484 \">table 1</a>). Despite randomization, an imbalance at baseline may have favored the placebo group, as there were more cases with isolated intracranial hypertension in the placebo group and more patients with infarcts in the nadroparin group.</p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of these two trials found that anticoagulant treatment compared with placebo was associated with a pooled relative risk of death of 0.33 (95% CI 0.08-1.21) and a risk of death or dependency of 0.46 (95% CI 0.16-1.31) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While these data suggest that anticoagulant treatment for CVT may be associated with a reduced risk of death or dependency, the results did not achieve statistical significance.</p><p>Two other trials were performed in India, but they were not included in the meta-analysis because only abstract information was available, and because the diagnosis of CVT was confirmed by CT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These trials included 57 and 40 patients, respectively. Both favored heparin compared with placebo: 15 percent versus 40 percent fatality in the Maiti trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and recovery in all patients versus two deaths and one residual hemiparesis in the Nagajara trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Limited data suggest that LMWH is more effective than UFH and at least as safe for the treatment of CVT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an open-label trial, 66 adults with CVT were randomly assigned to treatment with LMWH or UFH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the LMWH group (0 versus 19 percent). At three months, the proportion of patients with complete recovery was greater for the LMWH group (88 versus 63 percent), but the difference was not statistically significant. Small numbers limit the strength of these findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a nonrandomized case-control study, a greater proportion of adult patients treated with LMWH (n = 119) compared with UFH (n = 302) were independent at six months (92 versus 84 percent, adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Treatment with LMWH was also associated with slightly lower rates of mortality (6 versus 8 percent) and new intracranial hemorrhage (10 versus 16 percent), but these outcomes were not statistically significant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-center double-blind trial conducted in Iran, 52 cases of CVT were randomly assigned to treatment with LMWH or UFH.

In the Berlin and Dutch trials, 34 of 79 patients (43 percent) included in the Berlin and Dutch trials had an intracerebral hemorrhage at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. None of the patients randomized to heparin developed a new intracerebral hemorrhage. In contrast, a new intracerebral hemorrhage developed in three patients randomized to placebo. Case series have also reported relatively low risks of intracranial hemorrhage (&lt;5 percent) and systemic hemorrhage (&lt;2 percent), and such hemorrhages did not influence outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. These findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that hemorrhage in CVT is caused by the probable mechanism of venous outflow blockage and very high intradural and intravenous pressure, leading to both rupture of venules and to hemorrhagic transformation of venous infarctions.</p><p>Similarly, observational data from single and multicenter case series suggest that anticoagulant therapy is safe in children with CVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Endovascular treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For adults and children with CVT who develop progressive neurologic worsening despite adequate anticoagulation with subcutaneous LMWH or intravenous heparin, endovascular thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy at centers experienced with these methods may be treatment options.

Many of the patients were severely ill; pretreatment intracerebral hemorrhage was present in 60 percent, and stupor or coma in 47 percent. A variety of devices were used, including the AngioJet rheolytic catheter, balloon angioplasty, stents, and microsnares; concurrent local thrombolysis was used in 71 percent. Overall, a good outcome was reported for 84 percent of patients; mortality was 12 percent. New or worsened intracerebral hemorrhage affected 10 percent. A high recanalization rate (95 percent, 21 percent partial) was achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While these results suggest that endovascular treatment may be useful and safe for CVT, there is concern for the possibility of publication bias and under-reporting of cases with poor outcome and complications. Furthermore, there may be bias in the reported outcomes, since treatment and evaluation were not blinded in nearly all the studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Dutch center series of 20 patients with CVT who were treated with endovascular thrombolysis, 8 patients (40 percent) died or became dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The guidelines suggest using LMWH instead of UFH. No recommendation is made regarding thrombolysis for acute CVT, except that patients who have a pretreatment low risk of poor outcome (eg, absence of coma, mental status disturbance, thrombosis of the deep venous system, intracranial hemorrhage, and malignancy) should not be exposed to aggressive treatments such as thrombolysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Stroke Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ASA)</span> guidelines for the prevention of stroke state that anticoagulation is reasonable for patients with acute CVT, even in selected patients with intracranial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In contrast, several studies have found that a good outcome after CVT is predicted when intracranial hypertension is the only manifestation of CVT at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/65,70,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,70,72</a>].</p><p>In patients with CVT presenting with isolated intracranial hypertension, a subgroup analysis of the ISCVT cohort found that poor outcome was associated with a longer diagnostic delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>In the ISCVT study, complete recovery at last follow-up was noted in 79 percent of the entire cohort of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2354064714\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of recurrent CVT is approximately 2 to 4 percent, while the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism in other locations ranges from 4 to 7 percent. These estimates are illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that prospectively followed 145 patients with CVT for a median of six years after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy, a recurrent CVT developed in five patients (3 percent), and other types of venous thromboembolism developed in another 10 patients (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The risks of recurrent CVT or other types of venous thromboembolism were 0.5 and 2.0 per 100 person-years, respectively. The risk of venous thrombotic events was significantly higher in males and in patients with severe thrombophilia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ISCVT study, which evaluated 624 patients with CVT over a median 16 months of follow-up, 14 (2 percent) had a recurrent CVT and 27 (4 percent) had other thrombotic events during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Previous venous thromboembolism was the only factor predicting recurrent events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the European cohort of 396 children with CVT (median age five years) followed for a median of 36 months, recurrent venous thrombosis occurred in 22 children at a median of six months, including CVT in 13 children (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. There were no recurrences of CVT among children younger than 25 months. Factors independently associated with recurrent cerebral and systemic venous thrombosis in children were nonadministration of anticoagulant therapy before relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 11.2, 95% CI 3.4-37.0), persistent occlusion on repeat venous imaging (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-14.8), and heterozygosity for the prothrombin (factor II) G20210A mutation (HR 4.3, 95% CI 1.1-16.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2595823051\"><span class=\"h2\">Recanalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are few studies, available data suggest that cerebral vein and sinus recanalization occurs in 40 to 90 percent of patients after CVT, mostly within the first four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. A systematic review identified only five small studies that evaluated recanalization after CVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In the pooled population of these studies, recanalization rates at three months and one year of follow-up were nearly identical (59 of 70 [84 percent] and 60 of 70 patients [85 percent]). A subsequent retrospective study of 102 patients with first-ever non-septic CVT treated with anticoagulation for at least 12 months found that the cumulative proportion of patients with any recanalization by 3, 6, and 9 months was 71, 90, and 94 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The time for 50 percent of patients to attain any recanalization was 64 days; the corresponding time for complete recanalization was 169 days.</p><p>The likelihood of recanalization appears to vary by location, with the highest rates observed in deep cerebral veins and cavernous sinuses, and lowest rates observed in the lateral sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In adults, the relationship of recanalization with outcome is unclear and data are limited. Some studies suggest that recanalization of the occluded sinus is not related with outcome after CVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/82,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,84</a>], while others suggest that complete recanalization is associated with improved functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2540536580\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

For children with CVT, with or without significant secondary hemorrhage, we suggest initial anticoagulation therapy with subcutaneous LMWH or intravenous heparin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3037533753\" class=\"local\">'Early anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measures to control acutely increased intracranial pressure and impending herniation, including decompressive surgery, may be required in patients with CVT. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Elevated intracranial pressure and herniation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CVT who have both seizures at presentation and focal cerebral supratentorial lesions (eg, edema, infarction, or hemorrhage on admission CT or MRI), we recommend seizure prophylaxis with antiepileptic medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Prophylaxis is not clearly required for those with a single early symptomatic seizure due to CVT in the absence of a supratentorial cerebral lesion, as there is often no seizure recurrence. Furthermore, seizure prophylaxis is not clearly required for patients who have focal cerebral lesions without seizures. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the acute phase of CVT, we suggest anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for a minimum of three months, aiming at an international normalized ratio (INR) target of 2.5 (acceptable range: 2 to 3) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An alternative to warfarin preferred by some experts (but <strong>not</strong> the authors of this topic) is the use of direct oral anticoagulants (ie, direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Long-term anticoagulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H787853191\" class=\"local\">'Selection of anticoagulant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is reasonable to stratify the duration of anticoagulation after the acute phase of CVT according to individual prothrombotic risk, continuing anticoagulation for three to six months for patients with a provoked CVT associated with a transient risk factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65303 \">table 2</a>), and for 6 to 12 months for patients with an unprovoked CVT. Indefinite oral anticoagulation is reserved for patients with recurrent CVT, extracerebral venous thromboembolism after CVT or an associated severe thrombophilia. (See <a href=\"#H1032541849\" class=\"local\">'Duration of anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiepileptic drug management, headaches, visual loss, and cognitive and psychiatric complications are additional problems that may complicate the subacute phase of CVT. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management after the acute phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant women with a history of CVT, we suggest temporary anticoagulation with subcutaneous LMWH throughout pregnancy and continuing up to eight weeks postpartum (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adolescent girls and adult women with a history of CVT, we advise <strong>not</strong> using combined oral contraceptives. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Oral contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CVT is associated with a good outcome (complete recovery or minor residual symptoms or signs) in close to 80 percent of patients. Nevertheless, approximately 5 percent of patients die in the acute phase of the disorder, and longer-term mortality is nearly 10 percent. The main cause of acute death with CVT is neurologic, most often from brain herniation. After the acute phase, most deaths are related to underlying disorders such as cancer. (See <a href=\"#H2654869574\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Predictors of poor long-term prognosis include central nervous system infection, malignancy, deep CVT location, intracranial hemorrhage, Glasgow coma scale score on admission &lt;9, mental status abnormality, age &gt;37 years, and male sex. Isolated intracranial hypertension at the time of CVT diagnosis may be a predictor of good outcome. Recurrent CVT appears to be uncommon, with rates ranging from 2 to 4 percent.
