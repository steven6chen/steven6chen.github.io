This condition affects approximately 1 to 5 percent of newborns. Although many affected infants are asymptomatic, the characteristic clinical features are thought to result from hyperviscosity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the metabolic effects of an increased red blood cell mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2573618794\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal newborn physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with older infants and children, term newborns have an increased red cell mass caused by the fetal response of increased hemoglobin production to a relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment and possibly vasomotor instability and venous pooling in newborn immediately after birth. The mean hematocrit (hct) and hemoglobin concentrations from <strong>capillary</strong> samples in healthy term infants at birth are 61&plusmn;7 standard deviations (SD) percent and 19.3&plusmn;2.2 (SD) <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25989135\"><span class=\"h2\">Polycythemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polycythemia is defined as hct or hemoglobin concentration &gt;2 SD above the normal value for gestational and postnatal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Accordingly, a term infant is considered to be polycythemic if the hct from a <strong>peripheral venous</strong> sample is &gt;65 percent or the hemoglobin is &gt;22 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. In clinical circumstances, the definition typically is based upon the hct, rather than the hemoglobin concentration.</p><p>The diagnosis of polycythemia is based upon <strong>peripheral venous</strong> samples because of the variability in measurements obtained from capillary samples. Hcts of blood from venous samples may be as much as 15 percent lower than those obtained from capillary samples. (See <a href=\"#H4356738\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperviscosity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polycythemia must be distinguished from hyperviscosity, which is defined as a blood viscosity &gt;12 centipoise, measured at a shear rate of 11.5 per second; or &gt;6 centipoise, measured at a shear rate of 106 per second [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Whole blood viscosity can be affected by significant increases in any of the elements of whole blood including red cells, white cells, platelets, plasma proteins, immunoglobulins or clotting factors. In neonates, the focus is generally on red cell excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Blood viscosity and hct have a linear relationship when the hct is &lt;60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. This relationship becomes exponential when the hct exceeds 65 percent, such that a small increase in hct is associated with a dramatic increase in viscosity. The relationship is less predictable for intermediate values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In one report, for example, hyperviscosity was present in 23 percent of infants with hcts in the range of 60 to 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Even for hct values &gt;65 percent, the relationship between hct and hyperviscosity is somewhat inconsistent. This was examined in a study of cord blood in 2461 infants of &gt;34 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Hyperviscosity was defined as &gt;2 SD above the mean for viscosity at each week of gestation, and polycythemia as an hct &gt;65 percent. Hyperviscosity occurred in only 47.4 percent of infants with polycythemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polycythemia occurs in 1 to 2 percent of healthy newborns born at sea-level and up to 5 percent of infants born at high altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/1,4,5,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,11,12</a>].

Hct values are highest in capillary samples, intermediate in peripheral venous samples, and lowest in samples drawn from the umbilical vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In one study of newborns with peripheral venous hcts &ge;65 percent, the mean values for capillary, peripheral venous, and umbilical venous hcts were 75, 71, and 63 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age at the time of sampling &ndash; Hcts increase from birth, reaching a maximum at approximately two hours of age, then decrease to levels in cord blood by 18 hours of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Method of hct measurement &ndash; Values obtained from centrifuged samples are higher than those using cell counters and correlate better with blood viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Hyperviscosity measured in venous samples occurred in only 3 to 5 percent of polycythemic infants detected by routine capillary screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/5,9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,18</a>]. Using cord blood samples, hyperviscosity occurred in approximately one-half of infants with polycythemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No matter how one measures the occurrence rate, neonatal hyperviscosity is still an uncommon clinical entity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood flow is determined by resistance to flow, which varies directly with the viscosity of the blood and inversely with the fourth power of the radius of the vessel through which the blood is passing. This is expressed by the equation derived from Poiseuille's law:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;R = 8hL <span class=\"nowrap\">/&pi;</span> r(4)</p></div></div><p>Where R = resistance to blood flow, h = viscosity, L = length of the vessel, and r = radius of the vessel. According to this relationship, a decrease in the radius of the vessel affects resistance to flow more strongly than does an increase in viscosity. Thus, an increase in viscosity will reduce blood flow only if the vessel radius remains constant.</p><p>Hyperviscosity is thought to result in reduced blood flow to organs, leading to poor tissue perfusion. However, studies in newborn lambs suggest that decreased cerebral blood flow in polycythemia may be due in part to a vascular response to increased arterial oxygen content related to the increased hemoglobin concentration, rather than to hyperviscosity. When polycythemia was maintained in these lambs but the oxygen delivery was reduced by infusing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium nitrite</a>, brain blood flow increased to baseline values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of polycythemia are multifactorial but are due to two major mechanisms: passive (erythrocyte transfusion) and active (increased intrauterine erythropoiesis). The table lists those conditions that have been associated with polycythemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85757\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85757 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30680686\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythrocyte transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of polycythemia in normal term infants is delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, which results in increased transfer of placental blood to the infant (erythrocyte transfusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This can occur intentionally or unintentionally (eg, at an unattended delivery) and may be exaggerated if the baby is held at a level below the mother immediately following birth, before clamping of the cord.</p><p>A 2013 meta-analysis of 15 trials involving 3911 mother-infant pairs found a nonsignificant trend toward lower risk of polycythemia with early versus late clamping of the cord (relative risk 0.39 [95% CI 0.12-1.27]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hemoglobin levels were lower among newborns in the early cord clamping group than in the late clamping group at 24 to 48 hours, but not at subsequent assessments. Fewer infants in the early cord clamping group required phototherapy for jaundice than in the late cord clamping group. There were no differences between early and late clamping in neonatal mortality or long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Cord clamping'</a>.)</p><p>Intrapartum hypoxia has also been associated with increased placental transfusion. Other associations include twin-to-twin transfusion, which occurs in 10 to 15 percent of monochorionic twins, and maternal-fetal transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], which is less common.

This typically is seen in infants who are small for gestational age or whose mothers have preeclampsia or other hypertensive or vascular disorders. Polycythemia may occur in pregnancies complicated by chronic maternal hypoxemia due to cardiac or pulmonary disorders, drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propranolol</a>, smoking, high altitude, or postterm delivery.

In two large prospective studies of infants with polycythemia that included matched controls, the majority of polycythemic infants were asymptomatic (74 to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

Necrotizing enterocolitis was reported in both study and control groups, but no statistically significant difference was demonstrated. Other findings often attributed to polycythemia, such as plethora, respiratory distress, tachycardia, hematuria, renal vein thrombosis, priapism, gallstones, hypotonia, irritability, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, abnormal cry, lethargy, jitteriness, and seizures, are a compilation from retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/14,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,30-32</a>] with no control patients and, therefore, may reflect observer bias.</p><p>Symptoms, when present, often begin by two hours after birth, after fluid shifts have occurred and the hematocrit (hct) is at its peak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Onset may be delayed to the second or third day of life in some infants who develop an increased hct because of excessive extracellular fluid loss. In this case, the volume depletion may exaggerate the expression of an already increased red cell mass or, in extreme cases, it may be the primary cause of the high hct. Infants with no symptoms by 48 to 72 hours of age are likely to remain asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/15,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,33</a>].</p><p>Symptoms usually attributed to this disorder are thought to be due to reduced tissue perfusion or associated metabolic abnormalities. However, animal data raise some questions as to whether this indeed is the pathophysiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The mechanism may involve increased glucose utilization by the increased number of circulating red cells. However, there are no data to support a causal relationship and hypoglycemia in these infants may be related to the multifactorial causes of polycythemia (eg, polycythemia commonly occurs in infants of diabetic mothers who are at risk for hypoglycemia due to increased insulin production).

This may occasionally lead to the development of gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The actual effect of polycythemia on hyperbilirubinemia is difficult to quantify, since interventions for polycythemia, such as exchange transfusion and hydration, also mitigate the hyperbilirubinemia. These treatment effects may explain why some studies do not show an association between polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4356714\"><span class=\"h2\">Which infants should be screened?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hematocrit (hct) should be measured in infants who have signs or symptoms that may be due to polycythemia, including cyanosis, tachypnea, and poor feeding and vomiting.

Higher volumes are associated with lower gestational ages <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed cord clamping. The desired hct is usually set at 55 percent.</p><p>In general, the exchange volume is 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> body weight. Blood can be removed and saline infused continuously (isovolumetric technique, the best approach in unstable infants) or the process can be accomplished using serial aliquots of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) may be increased in infants treated with PET for polycythemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. In a small trial, NEC developed in 8 of 43 patients with hyperviscosity who underwent the procedure and in none of the controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Treated infants also had significantly more gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdominal distension, bloody stools, and emesis). Contrasting results were reported in a retrospective analysis of 185 polycythemic term infants treated with PET, in which no evidence of severe gastrointestinal injury was detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The contrasting findings might be explained by differences between the PET techniques used in the two studies: in the second study, the umbilical vein was used to withdraw the allotted volume of blood to be exchanged, and the replacement volume was administered via peripheral vein. Because this study did not test and select patients for hyperviscosity, the population studied was probably at lower risk for complications. The study is also limited by its retrospective nature and lack of a control group.

The available evidence suggests that the clinical outcome may depend more upon associated conditions, such as hypoglycemia, or on the underlying disorder (eg, placental insufficiency), than on polycythemia itself. As previously discussed, partial exchange transfusion (PET) does not appear to improve long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3383031964\" class=\"local\">'Long-term effects'</a> above.)</p><p>Studies evaluating the effects of polycythemia and hyperviscosity on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes have produced conflicting results. Some studies have found associations between hyperviscosity and neurologic sequelae (including motor and speech delays, intellectual disability, and lower academic achievement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/28,29,31,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,31,46</a>]; while others have not found an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>].</p><p>A study evaluating three-year outcomes of 111 newborns with hyperviscosity (of whom 42 received PET) compared with 110 controls found that infants with hyperviscosity had more motor and neurologic abnormalities (38 versus 11 percent) than controls did. These findings did not differ according to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Maternal preeclampsia and neonatal hypoglycemia were more common in the hyperviscosity group than in the control group. In addition, many infants in both groups were lost to follow-up, including approximately one-third of the patients with hyperviscosity.</p><p>A similar study compared neurodevelopmental outcomes of 93 infants with hyperviscosity, half of whom were randomly assigned to receive PET, with 93 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Hyperviscosity was associated with delays in speech and fine motor development at one and two years of age, and persistent effects on intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and academic achievement also were seen in the patients available for follow-up at seven years of age (53 percent of the original cohort) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Among the infants with hyperviscosity, treatment with PET was not associated with effects on any of these neurodevelopmental outcomes, except for neurologic diagnoses and fine motor abnormalities at two years of age; no differences were noted at seven years.</p><p>By contrast, in a study of 71 infants with neonatal polycythemia identified by routine screening, of whom 46 were available for follow-up at an average age of 30 months, neurodevelopmental outcomes were similar among infants with symptomatic hyperviscosity, asymptomatic hyperviscosity, and asymptomatic infants with normal viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Another study reported normal neurologic and developmental achievement at 8 months and at two years of age among 49 infants with polycythemia and hyperviscosity treated with and without PET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-polycythemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>There are important limitations to these studies that preclude a clear understanding of the effects of polycythemia, or a firm answer on the clinical benefits of PET. Most reports include patients with polycythemia detected by routine screening who also had documented hyperviscosity. Thus, the results may not apply to infants with polycythemia alone or those in whom polycythemia was detected because they were symptomatic. Most studies did not control for preexisting confounders such as maternal diabetes, smoking, or intrauterine growth retardation, so the observed differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes may not be caused by the polycythemia. In studies evaluating PET, the intervention was usually performed after six hours of life, so the effect of earlier intervention is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30680580\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycythemia is defined as hematocrit (hct) &gt;2 standard deviations above the normal value for gestational and postnatal age. A term infant is considered to be polycythemic if the hct from a <strong>peripheral venous</strong> sample is &gt;65 percent. There is considerable variability in measurements obtained from capillary samples; if the capillary hct is &gt;65 percent, testing should be repeated on a sample of venous blood. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4356738\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperviscosity occurs in approximately 50 percent of infants with polycythemia, and the risk of hyperviscosity increases sharply as the hct increases above 65 percent. Polycythemia is associated with reduced blood flow to organs, but it is unclear whether this is due to the hyperviscosity or to the increased arterial oxygen content related to the polycythemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hyperviscosity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common association of polycythemia in normal term infants is delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, which results in increased transfer of placental blood to the infant. Other associations include twin-to-twin transfusion, placental insufficiency, maternal hypoxemia or diabetes, and infant risk factors including macrosomia and endocrine abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85757\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85757 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of infants (74 to 90 percent) with polycythemia are asymptomatic. In other infants, symptoms associated with polycythemia may include <span class=\"nowrap\">cyanosis/apnea,</span> vomiting, or poor feeding. The primary laboratory abnormality associated with polycythemia is hypoglycemia. Symptoms, when present, often begin by two hours after birth, but may be delayed to the second or third day of life in some infants. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All polycythemic infants should be observed closely for hydration status and monitored for common complications, such as hypoglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia.

Adequate hydration and glucose intake should be ensured by monitoring oral intake, body weight, and urine output. The venous hct should be repeated in 12 to 24 hours, while monitoring closely for the development of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asymptomatic infants with a hct &gt;70 percent can be treated with supportive care such as intravenous hydration, or (less often) with PET.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants with <strong>symptomatic </strong>polycythemia<strong>,</strong> we suggest supportive treatment with intravenous hydration and glucose rather than partial exchange transfusion (PET) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In addition, management includes close monitoring of urine output and pursuit of other possible reasons for the symptoms. PET is a reasonable alternative treatment based on limited data on short-term beneficial effects; however, the available evidence suggests that PET does not improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcome, and that PET may be associated with possible risks (eg, necrotizing enterocolitis).
