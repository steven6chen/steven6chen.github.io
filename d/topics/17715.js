The treatment and prevention of HBV infection has taken on great significance in light of the negative impact HIV has on the natural history of chronic HBV infection. In coinfected patients, HBV infection is best treated with oral antiviral agents that can also be used to treat HIV. Once initiated, they are continued indefinitely in most individuals to maintain suppression of both viruses.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of chronic HBV infection in the HIV-infected host.

Chronic HBV infection is defined as a positive (ie, reactive) hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) on two occasions at least six months apart.</p><p>This approach to treatment differs from that used in patients who have HBV monoinfection, in which the decision to initiate therapy is based upon the blood HBV DNA level, as well as the degree of liver damage and inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for the difference in treatment of chronic HBV in persons with HIV infection is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent drug resistance &ndash; Guidelines for the treatment of HIV-infected adults recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-infected patients, regardless of CD4 cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Certain antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV are also used to treat HBV. As a result, coinfected patients may be initiated on medications for their HIV that have activity against HBV. To prevent the development of HIV <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HBV drug resistance, it is important that both infections be optimally treated at the same time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slow progression of HBV infection which has an accelerated course in coinfected patients &ndash; The course of HBV infection is accelerated in HIV-infected patients and treatment may reduce the risk of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HBV</span> coinfected patients have faster progression of fibrosis and an increased risk of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma compared with HBV-monoinfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. This may be due, in part, to less immunologic control of HBV infection, which is reflected by the higher levels of HBV DNA in coinfected compared with monoinfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Liver-related mortality is also greater in coinfected individuals compared with patients with HIV or chronic HBV infection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. As an example, in a cohort study of HIV-infected men, <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HBV</span> coinfected individuals were approximately 17 times more likely to die of liver-related causes compared with those monoinfected with HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In patients with advanced immunosuppression (ie, CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> initiating ART in a patient not treated for HBV infection may result in acute hepatitis due to immune reconstitution (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;, section on 'IRIS associated with hepatitis B and C'</a>). Although no studies have evaluated whether or not the incidence of IRIS is reduced by treating both infections simultaneously, there is a theoretical benefit since the risk of IRIS related to HBV infection is increased in patients with high levels of HBV viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>On rare occasion when a delay in HIV treatment is being considered (as an example, a coinfected patient who is an elite controller), evaluating the need to treat HBV based upon the HBV DNA level, aminotransferase levels, and stage of liver disease is essential. If HBV treatment is indicated, then both viruses should be treated simultaneously (rather than treating HBV alone) and ART should not be delayed. A discussion of elite controllers is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents#H82010217\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Long-term nonprogressors'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with occult hepatitis B should also receive treatment to suppress both viruses. Such patients have a detectable HBV DNA and a positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), but have negative serologies for HBsAg on two occasions at least six months apart (ie, they do not have resolving or chronic HBV). The clinical significance of occult hepatitis B in HIV-infected individuals is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, in a patient with occult hepatitis B, it is important that an HIV regimen be fully active against HBV to prevent the development of drug-resistant HBV. (See <a href=\"#H489595324\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250145399\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION PRIOR TO HBV TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV coinfection includes a detailed history and physical examination to assess for hepatotoxic medications and evidence of advanced liver disease; laboratory testing to evaluate markers of HBV activity, kidney function, liver function, and coexisting causes of liver disease; testing to determine the stage and activity of liver disease; and ultrasound imaging to screen for evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Tenofovir is available in two formulations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (TDF) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (TAF). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Entecavir</a> is a suitable alternative treatment for HBV in treatment&ndash;na&iuml;ve patients (ie, those who have never been treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, or entecavir); however, it is associated with a high rate of HBV resistance in patients with lamivudine-resistant virus.

For such patients, options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> or renally dosed TDF. The choice of agent depends in part upon the patient's past treatment history.

For such patients, we generally prefer a nucleoside-sparing regimen for the treatment of their HIV (ie, one that does not contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>). There is a theoretical risk that patients who take lamivudine and entecavir together are at greater risk for the development of HBV resistance compared with those who take entecavir alone. (See <a href=\"#H202382033\" class=\"local\">'When entecavir is used'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We <strong>avoid</strong> an HIV ART regimen that uses <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> monotherapy for the treatment of HBV (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-abacavir-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir-abacavir-lamivudine</a>) because of the rapid emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV. If a patient is receiving an HIV regimen that only provides lamivudine monotherapy for HBV, we modify the ART regimen to include tenofovir.
