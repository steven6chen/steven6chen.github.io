In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other disorders, MTX is administered as long-term, low-dose therapy, usually 7.5 to 25 mg weekly, unlike its use for treatment of malignant disease, where it is may be administered in a cyclic fashion in doses of 1 gram or more.</p><p>The most commonly observed side effects of MTX at doses typically used for the treatment of RA are rarely life-threatening, in contrast with the high doses used in the treatment of malignancies. Nevertheless, they may become clinically significant if they result in premature discontinuation or dose alteration of a drug that is the best therapeutic alternative for a given individual.</p><p>Potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity, pulmonary damage, and myelosuppression may be seen with use of MTX as either high- or low-dose therapy, while nephrotoxicity is a manifestation of high-dose therapy that occurs rarely, if ever, with low-dose MTX treatment.</p><p>The major side effects of low-dose MTX are reviewed here. The use of low-dose MTX in patients with RA and other rheumatic diseases and the clinical use and adverse effects of high-dose MTX and related adverse effects are described separately.

However, alopecia can develop within weeks and is not generally related to the MTX dose. Macrocytosis may take many months to develop; it should not always be assumed to be due to folate deficiency, as patients on MTX are typically receiving daily folate supplementation; it may instead be from an unrelated cause (eg, due to vitamin B12 deficiency) or can occur on MTX with normal serum levels of both folate and vitamin B12. Rash may appear within days of each weekly MTX dose and fade by the time of the next week's dose. On the other hand, stomatitis may persist for days or weeks; it can be mild or, on occasion, painful enough to make eating difficult and result in a desire to discontinue therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59544108\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the common toxicities of MTX can be managed symptomatically, but patients with persistent symptoms sometimes require MTX dose reduction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nausea</strong> &ndash; Patients who continue to have nausea associated with MTX administration may get some relief with a histamine H2 blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 150 to 300 mg orally) or a proton pump inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 20 to 40 mg orally). These drugs are usually cycled in a weekly manner with MTX, being used the evening before, the day of, and the morning after the weekly MTX dose. Patients with nausea and other gastrointestinal symptoms also benefit from daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation. Nausea may also be improved by increasing the dose of daily folic acid up to 3 to 5 mg or adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (folinic acid) 8 to 10 hours after the weekly MTX dose. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of side effects with folate'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stomatitis</strong> &ndash; In patients with mild to moderate stomatitis, we gradually increase the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> dose from 1 mg daily up to 2 mg or higher (to a maximum of 5 mg daily) by 1 mg increments until the toxicity is controlled (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of side effects with folate'</a> below). In patients without an adequate response and continued bothersome symptoms despite taking 5 mg daily, we add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>. In patients in whom the combination of folate and leucovorin is inadequate, we gradually reduce the MTX dose to determine if a lower dose will be tolerated. Patients presenting with severe oral ulcers may require both a lowering of the MTX dose and an increase of folic acid. Once the acute toxicity has resolved, the patient may be able to increase the weekly dose of MTX back to the level being used prior to the onset of the oral ulcers. A recent decrement in renal function should also be excluded as a contributing factor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Stomatitis (oral mucositis) can occur at any dose of MTX but is more likely to be seen at higher doses. Data regarding the usefulness of supplements of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> are mixed. A systematic review in 1998 of folic acid or leucovorin supplementation concluded that these agents reduced the risk of stomatitis and other disorders of the digestive tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, no difference in the proportion of patients developing mucositis (15 to 18 percent) or diarrhea (8 to 14 percent) were noted in a subsequent randomized trial in 434 patients that compared folic acid, leucovorin, and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, if a patient is not receiving folate supplementation, addition of folic acid or leucovorin may speed healing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-toxicity-associated-with-chemotherapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral toxicity associated with chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Mucositis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal liver chemistries</strong> &ndash; The monitoring of liver chemistries and the management of patients with abnormalities in these tests are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose methotrexate for nonmalignant disease&quot;, section on 'Guidelines in RA'</a>.)<strong> </strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rash</strong> &ndash; We reduce the MTX dose in patients with the infrequent manifestation of a cutaneous eruption from MTX, but discontinue the medication in patients who do not respond to dose reduction, as the rash may represent a hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurotoxicity</strong> &ndash; Symptoms such as severe headaches, fatigue, and problems concentrating may require dose reduction, and in some patients will require drug discontinuation. The mechanism by which these occur is uncertain; it has been suggested that the neurotoxicity of MTX may be related to the accumulation of adenosine due to the inhibition of purine synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever </strong>&ndash; Fever can be induced by MTX, but it is important to exclude infection as the cause before attributing this finding to MTX alone. Infections with <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly termed <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em>) and fungi can occur; herpes zoster is rare, in contrast to its more frequent occurrence with glucocorticoids, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, Janus kinase inhibitors, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematologic abnormalities</strong> &ndash; We withhold MTX in patients in whom the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) increases to about 110 microm<sup>3</sup>, based upon our clinical experience. This approach is supported by observations in a case series that sustained elevation in the MCV may be a predictor of hematologic toxicity due to folate depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, these observations have not been routinely confirmed in clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia or anemia are managed by dose reduction, but may require discontinuation of therapy depending upon their severity. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59544302\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL SEVERE ADVERSE EFFECTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatotoxicity due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) may result from direct damage to hepatocytes; or, in patients with concomitant viral hepatitis, MTX may enhance viral damage. Minor elevations in aminotransferases are common, but hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis may infrequently occur. Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose MTX is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose methotrexate for nonmalignant disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Severe hepatotoxicity is very uncommon in patients managed using appropriate prevention strategies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose methotrexate for nonmalignant disease&quot;</a>).

It is more common during the first year of treatment. Either symptomatic or asymptomatic radiographic lung damage may be due to inflammation, infection, or MTX-related neoplasia. A baseline chest radiograph should be obtained prior to initiating MTX treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Pulmonary toxicity, including its pathogenesis, manifestations, evaluation, and management, is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methotrexate-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59547426\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MTX is an immunomodulatory but not significantly immunosuppressive agent in the doses used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; it is not associated with opportunistic infections in the overwhelming majority of those treated with MTX unless the patients are also being treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, other immunosuppressive disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or biologic agents. MTX can affect T cell activity in the weekly doses used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], and cases of <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. MTX can also increase risk of lymphoproliferative disease. (See <a href=\"#H59546082\" class=\"local\">'Risk of lymphoproliferative disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with severe infections (eg, pneumonia requiring hospitalization), we hold the MTX dose until the patient has recovered from the illness. We do not withhold therapy in patients with minor infections (eg, pharyngitis or a urinary tract infection treated with a short course of oral antibiotics).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Myelosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myelosuppression is the major dose-limiting side effect of high-dose MTX, but is infrequent in patients receiving low-dose therapy. With low-dose weekly therapy, as used in RA, hematologic toxicity in association with macrocytic red blood cells may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but a more serious abnormality is the development of pancytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Occasionally, anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia may occur without significant reductions in other cell lines. To prevent these complications, guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommend that a routine peripheral complete blood count should be performed every four weeks during the first three months of therapy, every 8 to 12 weeks from three to six months, and every 8 to 12 weeks thereafter, depending upon the nature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity of abnormalities noted during monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Myelosuppression with low-dose MTX is more likely if renal function is impaired (eg, in the setting of an acute illness or addition or change of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [NSAID]) or if MTX is taken daily instead of weekly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Pharmacology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59546082\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of lymphoproliferative disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoproliferative disorders occur with increased frequency in RA, independent of specific therapies, but MTX therapy may increase such risk. Data from a large observational cohort (the National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases) found a small increase, based upon patient reports, which was not statistically significant (standardized incidence ratio of 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-3.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Rarely, lymphoproliferative &ldquo;malignancies&rdquo; may develop after long-term therapy but regress spontaneously after MTX is withdrawn. They are usually of B-cell origin and some are associated with latent Epstein Barr virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Lymphoproliferative disorders in RA are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease outcome and functional capacity in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Lymphoproliferative disorders'</a>.)</p><p>One prospective study described 25 cases of lymphoma in patients with RA who were being treated with MTX throughout France over a three-year period. Among these were seven cases of Hodgkin disease (27.8 and 2.8 cases per 100,000 per year for men and women respectively), an incidence that was more than expected for an age- and gender-matched population (adjusted standardized incidence ratio [SIR] of 7.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was not increased by MTX therapy. Chemotherapy should be withheld until MTX has been stopped, since some of these tumors regress within four weeks after MTX has been discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Continued vigilance is necessary in those who regress, since relapse has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease outcome and functional capacity in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Lymphoproliferative disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephrotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant nephrotoxicity due to MTX may occur with use of high doses, but occurs very rarely, if at all, in patients on low-dose regimens. However, even at the low weekly doses used in rheumatic diseases, MTX use may be associated with slight decreases in creatinine clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. MTX is primarily cleared via the kidneys, with 80 to 90 percent being excreted unchanged in the urine. Thus, impaired renal excretion of the administered MTX and consequent prolonged exposure to the drug increase the risk of myelosuppression and other toxicities. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucarpidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Glucarpidase</a> (carboxypeptidase G2), a recombinant bacterial enzyme that cleaves MTX into inactive metabolites, speeds clearance, and may be used when impaired renal function causes delayed elimination of MTX in patients receiving high-dose MTX. Its role in patients who develop renal toxicity while receiving chronic low-dose therapy is unclear. MTX-induced renal failure and the use of glucarpidase in the management of this complication are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

There does not appear to be a downside to this recommendation because of the lack of toxicity of folic acid. The dose may be increased to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> as needed, based upon reporting of residual symptoms. Folic acid can be taken daily, including the day on which MTX is administered, because it is passively taken up by the cell and does not compete with MTX for uptake by the reduced folate carrier. Symptoms and findings most likely to be decreased by folic acid treatment include gastrointestinal symptoms and hepatic transaminase elevations; stomatitis and mouth sores may also be reduced, and fewer patients on folic acid supplementation discontinue MTX therapy.</p><p>In patients who have not had a satisfactory response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (folinic acid), the reduced form of folate. Leucovorin is considerably more expensive than folic acid, and timing and dosing are critical both in preventing toxicity and in maintaining the efficacy of MTX. A typical dose is 2.5 to 5 mg given once weekly, 10 to 12 hours after MTX administration. The dose of the L-isomer (L-leucovorin) is one-half the dose of the racemic preparation (leucovorin calcium).</p><p>MTX interferes with the cellular utilization of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, and folate depletion is considered to be the cause of most of these complaints. Most, but not all, studies that lend support to this theory have noted that many of these reactions can be alleviated or prevented by the addition of supplemental folic acid, without changing the efficacy of MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/1,3,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,32-35</a>].</p><p>The benefit of folate supplementation is best illustrated by an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of six randomized trials involving 624 patients, which found a reduction in adverse effects without loss of MTX efficacy with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> or of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> supplementation compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Statistically significant reductions were seen in gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (relative risk [RR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.92); in abnormally elevated serum hepatic transaminases (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15-0.34); and in withdrawal from using MTX for any reason (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28-0.53). The absolute risk reductions in gastrointestinal side effects, transaminase elevations above normal, and MTX discontinuation were 9, 16, and 15 percent, respectively. There was a statistically nonsignificant trend suggesting a possible decrease in stomatitis and in mouth sores as well.</p><p>However, some data have suggested that daily folate may reduce the efficacy of MTX for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This was illustrated in a post-hoc analysis of the outcomes of two control groups in two separate randomized controlled trials that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> with MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A clinically modest, but statistically significant, decrease in efficacy was noted in those who received MTX and folate concomitantly (American College of Rheumatology [ACR]20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates in patients not receiving folate were a mean of 17, 14, and 12 percent higher, respectively, compared with patients who did take folate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Liver enzyme abnormalities were less frequently noted in those receiving folate. Adverse effects of MTX were not reduced by folate administration in this study, although they clearly are overall.</p><p>These toxicities can be predicted by the baseline folate status at the time of initiation of MTX therapy. If possible, patients should avoid other medications that have the potential for depleting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> when administered daily (which is most often given as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Leucovorin</a> also reduces MTX toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>], although at doses above 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> it may diminish the efficacy of MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Leucovorin is reduced folate (FH4), while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> is the form of the vitamin found prior to the metabolic reduction to FH4 by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Since DHFR is one of the target enzymes of MTX, leucovorin is more potent in overcoming the metabolic block in this pathway.</p><p>Despite the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> in relieving the above symptoms, there is no compelling evidence that the hepatic or pulmonary toxicity are related to folate depletion. However, hepatic folate stores are depleted by MTX at the doses used in RA, and these stores can be repleted by short-term oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, a relationship between folate depletion and hepatic toxicity has not been established.

These include gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, stomach upset, and loose stools; stomatitis or soreness of the mouth; a macular punctate rash that usually occurs on the extremities and that spares the trunk; central nervous system problems including headache, fatigue, or impaired ability to concentrate; alopecia; fever; and hematologic abnormalities, particularly macrocytosis.

Myelosuppression with low-dose MTX is more likely if renal function is impaired in the setting of an acute illness or addition or change of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). MTX may also increase the risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
