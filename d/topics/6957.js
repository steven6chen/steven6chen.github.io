When the neck is deflexed, the cephalic diameter that needs to pass through the maternal pelvis is wider than the suboccipitobregmatic diameter of the flexed head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59887 \">figure 2</a>), which inhibits engagement and subsequent fetal descent.

Maternal or fetal anatomic factors that prevent flexion or favor extension of the fetal neck increase the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">face/brow</span> presentation. </p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Face/brow</span> presentation has been associated with anencephaly, severe hydrocephalus with cephalomegaly, anterior neck mass, multiple nuchal cords, cephalopelvic disproportion, <span class=\"nowrap\">prematurity/low</span> birth weight, macrosomia, contracted maternal pelvis, platypelloid pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58301 \">figure 3</a>) multiparity, polyhydramnios, previous cesarean delivery, and black race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/2,5,8,9,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,8,9,11-13</a>]. </p><p>In multiparous women, poor abdominal muscle tone may permit the uterine fundus and fetal trunk to swing anteriorly, which may extend the cervical spine, leading to a face or brow presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Alternatively, late engagement of the vertex in multiparous women, often after the onset of labor, may be the predisposing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The association with polyhydramnios may be a secondary effect of impaired swallowing due to obstruction of the fetal trachea and esophagus from a hyperextended fetal neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Polyhydramnios also occurs with fetal anomalies associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">face/brow</span> presentation, particularly anencephaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The increased frequency of prior cesarean delivery in pregnancies with face and brow presentation may be explained by a contracted maternal pelvis, which predisposes to both dystocia and malpresentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Prematurity has been linked to <span class=\"nowrap\">face/brow</span> presentation, possibly because a very small fetus can descend with the neck partially extended; however, the association between prematurity and face presentation is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. The increased risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">face/brow</span> presentation in black women may be due to difference in pelvic dimensions between white and black women and a higher rate of prematurity in black women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FACE PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H744178875\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Face presentation refers to a fetal presentation in which the fetal face from forehead to chin is the leading fetal body part descending into the birth canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F99575\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99575 \">figure 4</a>). The fetal neck is sharply deflexed and the occiput may touch the back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intrapartum diagnosis of face presentation is made by vaginal examination in the late first or the second stage of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Palpation of the orbital ridge and orbits, saddle of the nose, mouth, and chin is diagnostic of face presentation. At diagnosis, nearly 60 percent of face presentations are mentum anterior, 26 percent are mentum posterior, and 15 percent are mentum transverse, and may be designated as left or right (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69905\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69905 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Sonography of a face presentation will show a hyperextended fetal neck. Although imaging studies can be performed to confirm the diagnosis if it is uncertain or internal examination cannot be done, imaging is not mandatory and results do not have prognostic value for predicting the outcome of labor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92676049\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Face presentation may be misdiagnosed as a frank breech presentation on digital examination since the latter is more commonly encountered (and therefore expected). Both presentations are characterized by soft tissues with an orifice; however, careful palpation will identify the bony facial structures and lead to the correct diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Course of labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During labor in the occiput anterior presentation, flexion of the neck normally brings the chin to the chest, resulting in the relatively small suboccipitobregmatic diameter (average length 11.9 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]) as the widest diameter negotiating the maternal pelvis. This diameter is able to traverse the obstetrical conjugate. By comparison, the widest diameter of the fetal head negotiating the pelvis in face presentation is the trachelo-bregmatic or trachelo-parietal diameter (also called trachelo- or submento-parietal; average length 12.6 cm), which is 0.7 cm greater than the suboccipito-bregmatic diameter (average length 11.9 cm) of a normally flexed vertex presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59887 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Therefore, protracted or arrest of descent is more likely with face presentation than with the more common occiput anterior presentation. </p><p>In a mentum anterior face presentation, the fetal neck extends even further backward after the fetus is engaged and the occiput may touch the back. Internal rotation occurs between the level of the ischial spines and ischial tuberosities, making the chin the presenting part of the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As the face descends onto the perineum, the fetal chin passes under the maternal symphysis pubis, slight flexion of the neck occurs, and delivery is possible via maternal expulsive forces. Over 75 percent of mentum anterior fetuses deliver vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/2,3,13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,13,16,17</a>].</p><p>In the mentum posterior face presentation, the head, neck, and shoulders attempt to enter the pelvis simultaneously, but the pelvis is usually not large enough to accommodate the fetus in this position. The fetal neck must extend the length of the maternal sacrum (average 12 cm) to allow the face to reach the perineum, but is too short to accomplish this task. Lastly, an open fetal mouth may act as a fulcrum against the sacrum preventing further descent. Therefore, the mentum posterior face presentation will <strong>not</strong> deliver vaginally unless spontaneous rotation occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59795 \">figure 6</a>) or the fetus is very small. In one series, the odds ratio (OR) for cesarean delivery with either mentum anterior or posterior was OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.5-4.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Abnormalities of the fetal heart rate occur more frequently with face presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/4,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16,18</a>].

Labor progress should be closely monitored as obstructed labor may occur, although not inevitably as in persistent mentum posterior position. Cesarean delivery is performed for standard obstetric indications. Outlet forceps for standard indications should only be used by experienced clinicians. Since engagement does not occur until the face is at +2 station, forceps should only be applied when the face is distending the perineum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Attempts at version, extraction, or midforceps delivery should be avoided, as they are associated with unnecessary maternal trauma and neonatal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mentum posterior</strong> &ndash; We recommend cesarean delivery for persistent mentum posterior presentation. As mentum posterior presentations are rare, we individualize management of such situations. For example, in a multiparous woman with an adequate pelvis and fetus estimated to weigh less than her prior newborns, we would follow labor progress closely and maintain a low threshold for abandoning attempts at vaginal birth if labor does not progress normally in the first or second stage. However, if the fetus is estimated to be larger than her prior newborns, or she is nulliparous, we would recommend cesarean delivery early in the labor course. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the past, manual conversion of the mentum posterior face to an occiput anterior or mentum anterior position was attempted using internal and external manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Although some clinicians have been successful with no significant neonatal or maternal complications, others have reported maternal deaths from uterine rupture, cord prolapse resulting in neonatal asphyxia, and cervical spine trauma resulting in severe neonatal neurologic sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Given the safety and ready availability of cesarean delivery, we believe internal version should be reserved for occasions when operative cesarean delivery is unable to be accomplished due to lack of surgical facilities and inability to arrange maternal transport, or absolute maternal refusal to allow a cesarean birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>Personnel and equipment for performing endotracheal intubation should be readily available at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Perinatal mortality decreased to 2 to 3 percent by 1980, likely due to the increased use of cesarean delivery, as well as other advances in obstetrical and neonatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Neonates who were in face presentation often have significant facial edema, facial <span class=\"nowrap\">bruising/ecchymosis</span> and skull molding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

As the brow descends into the birth canal, downward pressure from uterine contractions and maternal pushing may further extend the neck, resulting in a mentum anterior face presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Alternatively, the neck may flex resulting in occiput posterior position; some fetuses delivered from the occiput posterior position were brow presentations at the onset of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Conversion to occiput anterior is rare. If the brow presentation persists, a dysfunctional, prolonged labor and cephalopelvic disproportion is likely because the mento-parietal (or mento-bregmatic) diameter is the largest diameter of the fetal head (13.4 cm). It is 0.8 cm wider than the trachelo-parietal diameter (12.6 cm) of the face presentation and nearly 1.5 cm wider than the suboccipito-bregmatic diameter (11.9 cm) of the vertex presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71301934\"><span class=\"h2\">Labor and delivery management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetal heart rate is monitored continuously during labor, ideally with an external device.

Women with a clinically adequate or proven pelvis can undergo a trial of labor since many brow presentations in this setting will convert to a more favorable presentation and will deliver vaginally. In one review, when brow presentation was diagnosed early in labor, 67 to 75 percent of fetuses spontaneously converted to a more favorable presentation and delivered vaginally; when diagnosed late in labor, 50 percent spontaneously converted (30 percent converted to a face presentation and 20 percent converted to an occipital presentation) and delivered vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].

Palpation of the orbital ridge and orbits, saddle of the nose, mouth, and chin is diagnostic of face presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69905\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69905 \">figure 5</a>) (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above). Palpation of the forehead, orbital ridge, orbits, and saddle of the nose, but not the mouth and chin is diagnostic of brow presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77290\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77290 \">figure 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetal heart rate is monitored continuously during labor, ideally with an external device, because of the increased prevalence of fetal heart rate decelerations. An internal device may cause facial or ophthalmic injuries if improperly placed. If internal monitoring is required, the electrode should be carefully applied over a bony structure to minimize the risk of trauma. (See <a href=\"#H71299951\" class=\"local\">'Labor and delivery management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 75 percent of mentum anterior fetuses deliver vaginally; this rate is similar to that for all fetuses in cephalic presentations. For face presentation with the mentum anterior or transverse, we suggest a trial of labor rather than cesarean delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxytocin</a> augmentation may be administered in the setting of a normal fetus with protracted labor, as long as the fetal heart rate pattern remains reassuring. (See <a href=\"#H71299951\" class=\"local\">'Labor and delivery management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mentum posterior face presentation will not deliver vaginally unless spontaneous rotation occurs, which is infrequent, or the fetus is very small or the pelvis very large. As mentum posterior presentations are rare, we individualize management of such situations. In a multiparous woman with an adequate pelvis and fetus estimated to weigh less than her prior newborns, we follow labor progress closely and maintain a low threshold for abandoning attempts at vaginal birth if labor does not progress normally in the first or second stage. If the fetus is estimated to be larger than her prior newborns or she is nulliparous, we perform cesarean delivery early in the labor course. We recommend cesarean delivery rather than manual rotation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H71299951\" class=\"local\">'Labor and delivery management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with a fetus in brow presentation and a clinically adequate or proven pelvis can undergo a trial of labor, with close monitoring and delivery by cesarean for standard indications. The brow presentation is often a transitional state: 50 percent will spontaneously convert to a face or occipital presentation. Fetuses with persistent brow presentation should be delivered by cesarean since vaginal delivery is not possible unless the fetus is very small.
