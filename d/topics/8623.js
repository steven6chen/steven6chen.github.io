Based on World Health Organization (WHO) data, age standardized death rates per 100,000 range from 46.56 in New Guinea, 17.16 in India, 1.65 in China, 1.62 in Russia, 0.97 in the United Kingdom, 0.88 in the United States, 0.82 in France, and 0.24 in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In an analysis of the WHO database using a locally weighted scatter plot smoother (LOESS) curve for the 5 to 34-year age group weighted by the individual country population, asthma mortality was essentially unchanged from 2006 to 2012, after decreasing substantially from 1993 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The analysis included the 46 countries for which data were available. The decline in death rates from 1993 to 2006 is largely attributable to the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids for persistent asthma and avoidance of highly potent, poorly selective beta-agonists such as isoprenaline forte and fenoterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Similar to international trends, asthma mortality in the United States has declined since reaching a peak in the 1990s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59239\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59239 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. From 2001 to 2015, United States deaths due to asthma decreased from 15 deaths per million population to 10.3 deaths per million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Among individuals with asthma, the rate of asthma deaths decreased from 2.1 per 10,000 persons in 2001 to 1.4 per 10,000 persons in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEMOGRAPHICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have frequent and severe asthma symptoms and evidence of airflow limitation are at greatest risk; however, cluster analysis has identified significant patient heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Fatal and near-fatal asthma exacerbations can occur sporadically and inexplicably in a minority of asthmatics whether the baseline level of disease activity is mild, moderate, or severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Therefore, any acute exacerbation of asthma may be a potentially fatal attack. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Group-based trajectory analysis has suggested three distinct clinical trajectories for patients with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficult to control asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this study, 58 percent of patients with asthma had infrequent severe exacerbations during five-year follow-up, 32 percent improved, having fewer exacerbations in subsequent years, and 10 percent had persistently frequent exacerbations. Near-fatal asthma events occurred in all three trajectories but were significantly more frequent for patients in the trajectory with persistently frequent exacerbations.</p><p>In the United States, fatalities from asthma most commonly occur in lower income, non-white, urban populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/6,7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,12</a>]. In 2013, the reported death rates from asthma per million population in the United States were 24 for non-Hispanic blacks, 10 for non-Hispanic whites, and 6 for persons of Hispanic origin, although data identifying Hispanic origin may not be strictly comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Disparities in income, education, and access to health care are widely recognized as important contributors to differences in mortality rates among different sociodemographic groups. In this regard, an analysis showed that the higher risk of death in African-American patients compared to white patients is not explained by race differences in deaths occurring in hospital and are therefore likely due to differences that precede hospitalization, such as differences in management at home or during transportation to the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Even in the modern treatment era with an emphasis on inhaled glucocorticoids, mortality among asthmatic patients is mainly due to asthma. In a retrospective Australian study conducted from 2005 to 2009, 85 percent of 283 asthma-associated deaths were specifically due to asthma rather than to other comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Notably, 70 percent of the deaths due to asthma had preventable or modifiable risk factors present. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICOPATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PROFILES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathology of acute severe asthma is complex and variable, possibly reflecting what may be different subtypes of the disease: slow onset and rapid onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81440 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Deaths from status asthmaticus are ultimately due to the consequences of severe airway obstruction, but the cause of the obstruction varies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Slow onset fatal asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on clinical and pathologic observations, it has been estimated that approximately 80 to 85 percent of patients who die of asthma have a history of progressive symptoms for more than 12 hours and often for one to three weeks. At autopsy, the airways of patients who die of this &quot;slow-onset&quot; asthma typically feature an eosinophilic inflammation and obstruction of airway lumens by tenacious mucus and desquamated epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. These changes probably develop over days to weeks. This suggests that most of these patients would have had sufficient time to seek medical attention for worsening shortness of breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid onset fatal asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a minority of patients with fatal or near-fatal exacerbations of asthma, possibly up to 20 percent (8 to 14 percent of asthma exacerbations in general), death occurs less than 2 to 6 hours after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. The airways of these patients with &quot;rapid-onset&quot; fatal asthma do not have eosinophil-predominant inflammation or widespread mucus plugging typical of status asthmaticus. Instead, severe airway obstruction appears to be mainly due to smooth muscle bronchospasm and neutrophils are the predominant inflammatory cell in the airway mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, specific characteristics that would help the clinician predict which patients are predisposed to rapid-onset asthma attacks have not been identified. Neither the severity of baseline asthma symptoms, years of asthma, smoking habits, asthma medication use, nor history of hospitalization for asthma help in identifying these patients. However, patients with rapid onset asthma exacerbations may more commonly report sensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Rapid-onset asthma exacerbations do not appear to be due to anaphylaxis, although that diagnosis must be considered given the rapidity of the deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-patients-at-risk-for-fatal-asthma/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>].
