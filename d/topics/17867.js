The mainstays of therapy are brief daytime naps and pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>It is important to realize that patients with narcolepsy often have concomitant obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep, fragmented sleep, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder that contribute to their daytime sleepiness. It is often helpful to treat these disorders first and then to focus on improving the sleepiness that is caused by the narcolepsy. This topic assumes that coexisting sleep disorders have been treated and reviews the treatment of narcolepsy and its symptoms.</p><p>The diagnosis and neurobiology of narcolepsy and the treatment of narcolepsy in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=narcolepsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Narcolepsy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several nonpharmacologic interventions that may benefit the patient with narcolepsy. These provide some benefit, but most patients also require medications that reduce sleepiness and cataplexy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3569591633\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of certain drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some drugs should be avoided by patients with narcolepsy. Drugs that can worsen daytime sleepiness include benzodiazepines, opiates, antipsychotics, and alcohol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Excessive daytime sleepiness due to medical disorders and medications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> or excessive caffeine can cause insomnia, which can worsen daytime sleepiness. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a> and other alpha-1 antagonists can worsen cataplexy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1680239926\"><span class=\"h2\">Napping and sleep hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral interventions are often helpful for optimal control of narcolepsy. One or two well-timed, 20-minute naps will often improve sleepiness for one to three hours though some patients only benefit from long naps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If it can be arranged, a brief nap at work or school is often helpful.</p><p>Sleep deprivation may worsen narcolepsy symptoms and therefore patients should be counseled to maintain a regular and adequate sleep schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insufficient sleep: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H903415546\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with narcolepsy face various psychosocial and work-related challenges throughout their lives; as a result, they may have difficulty meeting economic and social responsibilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. They also have the additional burden of coping with misperceptions about the causes and the involuntary nature of their symptoms.</p><p>Common misconceptions, even among medical caregivers, are that sleep attacks and cataplexy (emotionally triggered muscle paralysis resulting in partial or complete collapse) are manifestations of poor motivation, denial, or avoidance. Thus, patients often benefit from participation in support groups that focus on coping skills and identification of community resources to assist with administrative and medical issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3677589479\"><span class=\"h2\">Health maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with narcolepsy are at increased risk for psychiatric comorbidities, particularly depression and anxiety. Patients should be screened for depression at least every one to two years, and those who screen positive should be referred for appropriate evaluation and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We recommend the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), as it is quick, adequately sensitive, and scores on other screening instruments such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) may be falsely elevated by questions related to fatigue, trouble concentrating, and fragmented sleep. The PHQ-2 is very simple and consists of two questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?</p><p/><p>Narcolepsy is also associated with higher than expected rates of hypertension, which may be related only in part to stimulants or other medications. In a study that assessed 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in 160 consecutive adults with narcolepsy type 1 (median age 32 to 41 years), rates of hypertension were 41 percent in untreated patients and 58 percent in patients taking stimulant medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with narcolepsy also have increased rates of obesity and diabetes. Cardiovascular risk factor assessment and modification is therefore an important component of health maintenance in patients with narcolepsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Our approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Daytime sleepiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with narcolepsy have some degree of daytime sleepiness. Although a few manage this successfully with only an afternoon nap, most patients require a medication that promotes wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such agents improve performance (measured by reaction time and simulated driving tasks), but their ability to stay awake rarely exceeds 70 to 80 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>The goals of therapy are to obtain &quot;normal&quot; alertness during conventional waking hours or to maximize alertness at important times of the day (eg, during work, school, or while driving). Once therapy has been optimized, the severity of residual sleepiness should be assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Score or the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, and persistently sleepy patients should be counseled to avoid potentially dangerous activities, such as driving. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Modafinil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Modafinil</a> has become a first line pharmacologic therapy because it provides good control of sleepiness, is generally well tolerated, and illicit use is rare. A non-amphetamine &quot;wakefulness promoting agent,&quot; its mechanism of action is not well understood, but it probably increases dopaminergic signaling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73012 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Armodafinil</a> is the active R enantiomer of modafinil and has very similar effects.</p><p>One trial randomly assigned 283 patients with narcolepsy to receive 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>, 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of modafinil, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. After nine weeks, patients treated with modafinil at either dose had significant improvements in their Maintenance of Wakefulness Test and Epworth Sleepiness Scale measurements, without evidence of tolerance to the drug. Similar results were found in a second clinical trial involving 271 patients with narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a small trial that included 13 patients with narcolepsy, patients randomly assigned to modafinil had improved driving performance compared with patients receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Modafinil</a> given once in the morning typically promotes wakefulness into the early evening without disrupting nighttime sleep. It is generally started at a dose of 200 mg each morning and then titrated up to 300 or 400 mg as needed. Patients with persistent afternoon sleepiness may benefit from divided dosing with 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the early afternoon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73910 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/14,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,17</a>]. Doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a> generally range from 150 to 250 mg each morning.</p><p>Side effects are uncommon but include headache, nausea, dry mouth, anorexia, and diarrhea. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Modafinil</a> may have fewer sympathomimetic effects than amphetamines and is often a good choice for older patients. Still, modafinil may increase blood pressure (especially at high doses), and it should be used cautiously in people with a history of arrhythmias or heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Rarely, modafinil can cause a serious rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Modafinil</a> reaches peak bioavailability in about two hours. The drug is hepatically metabolized and induces several cytochrome P450 enzymes, thus decreasing the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and perhaps other medications; women of childbearing age who use modafinil should use an alternative method of contraception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Methylphenidate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylphenidate</a> is a central nervous system stimulant and a potent wakefulness-promoting drug. Although effective, its sympathomimetic side effects can be problematic.</p><p>The initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> (10 mg) is typically administered twice per day, with the last dose given no later than about 3:00 PM. Therapy is often initiated with immediate release formulations and then converted to a sustained release formulation once a stable daily dose has been reached. Methylphenidate dosages are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73910 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Typical doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> increase systolic blood pressure about 5 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], which may have long term consequences. In addition, regulatory authorities reviewed several cases of sudden death in patients taking methylphenidate and issued a warning regarding serious cardiovascular events in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Some of these deaths were associated with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, while others may have been related to arrhythmias. Patients taking high doses for daytime sleepiness also can develop psychosis, anorexia, or require psychiatric hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Methylphenidate and other stimulants can also lower the threshold for seizures. The potential for methylphenidate dependency exists. Patients prescribed methylphenidate should be carefully informed about these risks, and their blood pressure, pulse, and weight should be monitored regularly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Amphetamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, amphetamines are central nervous system stimulants. Amphetamines may be the most potent wakefulness-promoting drugs, although some patients require relatively high doses. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextroamphetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dextroamphetamine</a>, mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisdexamfetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisdexamfetamine</a> are among the most commonly prescribed. The amphetamines are considered second-line agents because their sympathomimetic side effects can be problematic. By increasing aminergic signaling, these drugs can also reduce cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/8,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26,27</a>].</p><p>A typical starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextroamphetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextroamphetamine</a> is 5 mg twice daily, with the last dose given no later than about 3:00 PM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73910 \">table 1</a>). Therapy is usually initiated with immediate release formulations and then converted to a sustained release formulation once a stable daily dose has been reached.</p><p>Amphetamines can produce adverse effects similar to those seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>. These include cardiovascular events (eg, hypertension, sudden death) and psychiatric events (eg, psychosis, anorexia, addiction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]. Patients prescribed amphetamines should be carefully informed about these risks and monitored regularly. Many states and countries require clinicians to use a prescription monitoring program when prescribing amphetamines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-epidemiology-prevention-identification-and-management#H29430024\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management&quot;, section on 'Prescription monitoring programs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cataplexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 30 percent of people with narcolepsy have cataplexy that is substantial enough to warrant treatment. Although hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis usually do not require pharmacological treatment, these symptoms are often improved by medications that suppress cataplexy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">REM sleep-suppressing drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brainstem circuits that generate REM sleep are strongly inhibited by norepinephrine and serotonin. Thus, drugs that increase noradrenergic and serotonergic signaling suppress REM sleep and reduce cataplexy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73910 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Antidepressants that selectively inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine or serotonin include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atomoxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>. Clinical experience suggests that they may substantially reduce cataplexy with relatively few side effects, although data from clinical trials are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. We have found extended release venlafaxine to be effective in many patients at a dose of 37.5 to 150 mg each morning, although fluoxetine and atomoxetine are also acceptable.</p><p>For many years, cataplexy was treated with tricyclic antidepressants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protriptyline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> that decrease the reuptake of aminergic neurotransmitters. These drugs are very effective, but many patients are bothered by anticholinergic side effects, including dry mouth and constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Nonetheless, they are quite effective for suppressing cataplexy, and low doses can be effectively used on an as-needed basis just before events likely to trigger cataplexy such as a party or wedding.</p><p>Abrupt withdrawal from any of these antidepressants can trigger status cataplecticus: severe, nearly continuous rebound cataplexy that can last up to several hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Sodium oxybate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium oxybate</a>, the sodium salt of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), is a metabolite of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). It may act through GABA-B receptors, but its precise mechanism of action in patients with narcolepsy is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium oxybate</a> markedly reduces cataplexy and, therefore, is a good choice for patients with severe cataplexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-39</a>]. The reduction in cataplexy develops over several weeks of treatment so doses should be adjusted slowly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium oxybate</a> can also decrease daytime sleepiness, perhaps by improving the quality of nighttime sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/35,36,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36,41,42</a>]. In one observational study, sodium oxybate was associated with a 30 percent decrease in subjective sleepiness, assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Similarly, another observational study demonstrated improved sleepiness with sodium oxybate, as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium oxybate</a> is given as a liquid at bedtime, with a second dose 2.5 to 4 hours later; this second dose is necessary as the half-life is only two to three hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73910 \">table 1</a>). Patients may initially need to set an alarm clock to remind them to take the second dose, but after a few weeks, many learn to wake around the correct time. An appropriate initial dose is 3 g, twice per night. The dose can be increased up to 4.5 g, twice per night if cataplexy persists.</p><p>The benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a> are often apparent in the first few days, but it can take three months or more to achieve the full response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; therefore, the dose should be increased slowly (0.75 g increases every two to four weeks), if needed. In a 12-week open-label study of 202 patients with narcolepsy type 1 who were either treatment-na&iuml;ve or had been previously exposed but not titrated to adequate clinical effect, the majority of patients were much improved (79 percent) or somewhat improved (11 percent) at their final dose level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The two most common final doses were 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/night</span> (40 percent) and 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/night</span> (33 percent).</p><p>Side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a> are dose-dependent and are more common than with most other anticataplexy drugs. Sodium oxybate rapidly produces deep sedation, so household safety should be discussed (ability to respond to smoke alarms, care for children, etc). Additional adverse effects include nausea and dizziness, urinary incontinence, mood swings, and worsening of sleepwalking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>Overdosage can result in respiratory depression, coma, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Coadministration with alcohol and central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines and opioids increases risk for impaired consciousness and respiratory depression. Due to these risks, combined use with alcohol, sedatives, or hypnotics is specifically contraindicated in United States licensing information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>Gamma hydroxybutyrate gained notoriety as a &quot;date rape&quot; drug and has potential for abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Thus, access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a> is restricted in the United States, and prescribers and patients are required to register with the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/REMS/default.htm&amp;token=8RYIFfyLhIBYEqeX7m6uPGtnB1wPEGG5AqBctyC78FWDesbcx0SAU6isWgqS3arFqy3gnPAWbqch2mKXg2URfg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7681\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies</a> (REMS) program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2354833586\"><span class=\"h3\">Pitolisant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pitolisant, a novel histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist, may be an effective treatment for cataplexy as well as daytime sleepiness. In a randomized trial of 106 adults with narcolepsy type 1, pitolisant was more effective than placebo at reducing weekly cataplexy rate (75 versus 35 percent relative reduction from baseline rates of 7 to 9 episodes per week) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (5.4 versus 1.9 point reduction from baseline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) scores and frequency of hallucinations were also improved compared with placebo. Daily doses ranged from 5 to 40 mg. Treatment-related adverse events were more common in the pitolisant group (28 versus 12 percent), most commonly headache, irritability, anxiety, and nausea. An earlier randomized trial found that pitolisant was more effective than placebo and improved daytime sleepiness to a similar degree as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> in 95 adults with narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Pitolisant is available in some countries in Europe but is not yet available in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2103527327\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AND LACTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of narcolepsy during pregnancy and lactation can be challenging. The risks of medication exposure to the fetus, which are often incompletely known, are weighed against risks of uncontrolled sleepiness that could result from discontinuation of symptomatic medications.</p><p>Decisions should therefore take into account multiple factors, including the potential harms of medications to the fetus, the stage of pregnancy, the severity of a patient's narcolepsy, and the availability and usefulness of nonpharmacologic therapies for symptom mitigation. It is always prudent to avoid medications in the first trimester, when organogenesis begins and information on teratogenicity is absent or minimal. Still, drug exposure after the first trimester can have effects on fetal growth and behavior since brain development is ongoing.</p><p>Based on an international survey of clinicians experienced in managing narcolepsy, most clinicians generally recommend discontinuing medications (or at least avoiding polypharmacy) during pregnancy unless the benefits of the medications outweigh the potential risk to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>Nonpharmacological options for symptom management during pregnancy include improving alertness with more daytime naps, optimizing nighttime sleep, and managing sleep disorders that can arise during pregnancy (eg, sleep apnea, restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease). Patients can also consider working reduced hours and using public transportation instead of driving. These same approaches can help in the postpartum period, when many women with narcolepsy report that their sleepiness interferes with infant care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Data are limited on risks to the fetus of various medications used for symptomatic treatment of narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Illicit use of amphetamines increases the risk of prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants of mothers with substance use disorder&quot;, section on 'Amphetamines'</a>). However, several studies examining the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> or amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during pregnancy have found either no association or only a small increase (less than 1.5-fold) in the relative risk of congenital malformations, placental abruption, growth restriction, and preterm birth among exposed infants and mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-58</a>]. Still, it is possible that exposure to amphetamines in utero may lead to lasting effects on the child's behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Long highway drives can be especially difficult, as many people with narcolepsy find it difficult to sustain vigilance under monotonous conditions. Unfortunately, there is little research on whether narcolepsy medications improve driving safety and how to determine whether a patient is safe to drive.</p><p>We recommend that clinicians have an honest discussion with patients about their driving ability. As sleepiness can be difficult for the patient to recognize, feedback from family and friends can be helpful. If a patient reports persistent sleepiness or has had an accident due to sleepiness, we recommend doing a maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) to determine whether the individual can stay awake even under boring circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This test cannot guarantee that an individual will remain alert when driving, but the results can still be helpful for optimizing medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)'</a>.)</p><p>Most narcolepsy patients are safe to drive, although it can be helpful to impose some limits. As an example, some individuals may be safe driving around town for 30 minutes but not on a four-hour, monotonous highway drive. Some may choose to take medications before driving, to break up longer drives with scheduled naps, or to take turns driving with a friend or colleague. Others may choose not to drive after a meal or after dark. Patients with narcolepsy should not work as commercial drivers.</p><p>Additional information on driving and risks associated with sleep disorders can be found elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with narcolepsy can benefit from a regular and adequate sleep schedule, scheduled daytime naps, avoidance of drugs that produce daytime sleepiness or insomnia, and a psychosocial support group. Screening for depression, hypertension, and obesity are also important components of health maintenance. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, periodic leg movements) can coexist with narcolepsy, thereby contributing to a patient's symptoms. Such disorders should be addressed before initiating narcolepsy-specific medications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most of the drugs available to treat narcolepsy target either daytime sleepiness or cataplexy. Therefore, many patients who have both symptoms require more than one drug to manage their disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few patients with narcolepsy ever feel fully alert despite optimal therapy. The goal of therapy is to improve alertness to the point where performance and safety are adequate for important activities like school or work. Once therapy has been optimized, the severity of residual sleepiness should be assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale or the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, and persistently sleepy patients should be counseled to avoid potentially dangerous activities, such as driving. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Daytime sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with sleepiness severe enough to require medication can be treated with stimulant medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, or amphetamines. We suggest an initial trial of modafinil, rather than methylphenidate or an amphetamine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The basis of this suggestion is that modafinil has been studied in patients with narcolepsy in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, and modafinil seems to produce fewer adverse effects. However, modafinil can be more expensive and there is no reason to suspect that its efficacy is superior to other stimulants. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Modafinil'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Methylphenidate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Amphetamines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> or amphetamines, clinicians should alert patients about the risks of serious cardiovascular and psychiatric side effects. Hypertension is common in patients with narcolepsy and may worsen with stimulant therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Methylphenidate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Amphetamines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a REM sleep-suppressing medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atomoxetine</a>) as first line therapy for cataplexy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We prefer extended release venlafaxine. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'REM sleep-suppressing drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients whose sleepiness or cataplexy does not improve with one of these medications, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a> may be of benefit. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Sodium oxybate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with narcolepsy have a three- to fourfold increased risk of having a car accident, and over one-third have had an accident due to sleepiness.
