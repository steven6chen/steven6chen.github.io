The percentage of women with vaginal colonization by <em>M. hominis</em>, <em>M. genitalium</em>, and <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp increases after puberty in proportion to the number of lifetime sexual partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Genital colonization may also be linked to lower socioeconomic status.</p><p>The rate of colonization with <em>M. hominis</em> increases more rapidly with increasing sexual experience in women than in men, suggesting that women are more susceptible to colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By adulthood, up to 80 percent of healthy women have <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp and 50 percent have <em>M. hominis</em> in their cervical or vaginal secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Sexually active men are also frequently asymptomatically colonized with <em>M. hominis</em> (25 percent in one series of 99 men attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Newborns who are colonized with <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp are presumed to have been exposed during passage through the birth canal, since colonization is less common in infants born by caesarean section.

Infants more than three months of age are rarely if ever colonized. <em>M. hominis</em> is seldom recovered from prepubertal boys, whereas a small percentage of prepubertal girls have been found to be colonized in some studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35510070\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas are the smallest free-living organisms. Because they lack a cell wall, neither mycoplasmas nor ureaplasmas can be visualized by Gram stain. In order to culture these organisms, specialized media containing animal serum is required. (See <a href=\"#H725159\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Most species of <em>Mycoplasma</em> undergo similar biochemical reactions in the microbiology laboratory as many other bacterial species. However, there are a few biochemical tests that are useful for species identification. For example, ureaplasmas are unique because of their ability to hydrolyze urea. It is unknown whether there is a difference in pathogenicity between the two named species of <em>Ureaplasma</em>, <em>U. urealyticum</em> and <em>U. parvum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although <em>Mycoplasma</em> and <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp normally exist in a state of adherence to mucosal epithelial cells of the respiratory or urogenital tracts, they can disseminate to other sites and cause infection when there is a disruption of the mucosa (eg, instrumentation, surgery, trauma) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an underlying immaturity in host defenses, such as in the developing fetus or premature infant. <em>M. hominis</em> and ureaplasmas have surface proteins that facilitate cytoadherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ureaplasmas can attach to erythrocytes, white blood cells, host mucosal cells, and even spermatozoa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The microbiologic burden of the genitourinary mycoplasmas may be higher in HIV-infected individuals than in the HIV-uninfected population, and immunosuppression, both cellular and humoral, may contribute to disseminated disease in <em>M. hominis</em>-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H407365\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND POSSIBLE DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. hominis</em> and <em>Ureaplasma</em> have been associated with genitourinary tract and nongenital infections. However, as stated above, evidence that mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas cause most of these conditions is tenuous at best.

It is more often detected in women. The role of <em>M. hominis</em> as a cause of PID remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one study, <em>M. hominis</em> was isolated from 4 of 50 fluid samples taken directly from the fallopian tubes of women with salpingitis versus none of 50 samples from control women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the same study, significant rises or falls in antibody titers to <em>M. hominis</em> occurred in 9 of 16 women with salpingitis who had positive lower genital tract cultures for <em>M. hominis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The presence of infection in the absence of changes in antibody titers may reflect the localized nature of salpingitis. The significance of these findings is uncertain. <em>M. hominis</em> is rarely present in patients with salpingitis who do not also have evidence of concurrent chlamydial or gonococcal infections or bacterial vaginosis. As a result, its role as a primary pathogen in salpingitis is still uncertain.

In a meta-analysis of studies involving 1507 NGU patients and 1223 controls, <em>U.

In another study, <em>U. urealyticum</em> was significantly associated with NGU only in men with fewer than 10 lifetime heterosexual partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The authors postulated that adaptive immunity may attenuate the clinical manifestations of <em>U. urealyticum</em> infection, so that men with more exposure to this organism are less likely to have symptoms of NGU from it. However, this hypothesis is not proven and other explanations are possible.

Controversies abound as to whether these organisms are causal or not, since colonization rates of ureaplasmas (35 to 90 percent) and <em>M. hominis</em> (5 to 80 percent) are high and variable in the normal pregnant female population and are highest in the sexually active patient. An additional unclear factor is the role that other organisms, such as those that cause bacterial vaginosis, play in concert with the genital mycoplasmas leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Over 200 named <em>Mycoplasma</em> species exist. However, only about six species, five of which inhabit the genitourinary tract, are established or presumed human pathogens; <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> is a respiratory tract pathogen. Mycoplasmas that are thought to cause disease in humans include <em>M. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Mycoplasma hominis</em>, <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, <em>Mycoplasma fermentans</em> (incognitus strain), <em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em>, and <em>Ureaplasma parvum</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas are the smallest free-living organisms. Because they lack a cell wall, neither mycoplasmas nor ureaplasmas can be visualized by Gram stain. In order to culture these organisms, specialized media containing animal serum is required. (See <a href=\"#H35510070\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although <em>M. hominis</em> and, to a lesser extent, <em>Ureaplasma</em> have been implicated in a number of conditions related to parturient women and their fetuses and newborns, the precise roles of <em>Mycoplasma</em> and <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp remain unproven, or even speculative in many diseases for the following reasons:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Many healthy asymptomatic adults have genitourinary colonization with <em>Mycoplasma</em> and <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Published studies on the pathogenicity of these organisms commonly have important design limitations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Detection of these organisms is difficult and complex. (See <a href=\"#H35510070\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although <em>Mycoplasma</em> and <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp normally exist in a state of adherence to mucosal epithelial cells of the respiratory or urogenital tracts, they can disseminate to other sites and cause infection when there is a disruption of the mucosa <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an underlying defect in host defenses, such as in the developing fetus or premature infant. (See <a href=\"#H35510070\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>M. hominis</em> has been associated with chorioamnionitis. A possible association with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is less well established. Nongenitourinary tract infections that have been reported include upper and lower respiratory infections, central nervous system infections, neonatal bacteremia and meningoencephalitis, and others. (See <a href=\"#H407365\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and possible disease associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Ureaplasma</em> spp have been linked to chorioamnionitis, postpartum and postabortal fever, and pneumonia, bacteremia, and abscesses in neonates. There is controversy about a possible association between <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (See <a href=\"#H407365\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and possible disease associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The options for diagnosing infections caused by <em>M. hominis</em> and <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp are limited due to the shortcomings of both culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. When available, specimens should be sent for both culture and PCR. Sophisticated methods are required to detect mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas by culture; most hospital microbiology laboratories are not prepared to culture them. PCR-based assays are becoming increasingly available in multiplex kits for the diagnosis of respiratory and genitourinary tract pathogens. They will soon replace culture as the diagnostic test of choice, although they do not allow for antimicrobial sensitivity testing. (See <a href=\"#H725159\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vitro susceptibility testing has not been standardized for mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas and in vitro susceptibility test results have not been well correlated with clinical outcomes. Most mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas are susceptible in vitro to macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. An exception is <em>M. hominis</em>, which is <strong>not</strong> susceptible to macrolides. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azithromycin</a> has the greatest activity against <em>M. genitalium</em> compared with other antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H466733115\" class=\"local\">'In vitro susceptibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with disease caused by a <em>Mycoplasma</em> or <em>Ureaplasma</em> spp should be treated. In contrast, patients who are found to be colonized with one of these organisms, but who do not have clinical disease, do not require treatment. Given the difficulty in obtaining a diagnosis, patients are often treated empirically. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For nonpregnant adults with disease caused by <em>M. hominis</em>, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).
