The dramatic increase in energy and nutrient requirements coincides with other factors that may affect adolescents' food choices and nutrient intake and thus, nutritional status. These factors, including the quest for independence and acceptance by peers, increased mobility, greater time spent at school <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> work activities, and preoccupation with self-image, contribute to the erratic and unhealthy eating behaviors that are common during adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Unhealthy eating habits are seen in adolescents in the United States and many other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>Sound nutrition can play a role in the prevention of several chronic diseases, including obesity, coronary heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, and type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-18</a>]. For this reason, nutrition remains an important objective for Healthy People 2020 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. To help prevent diet-related chronic diseases, researchers have proposed that healthy eating behaviors should be established in childhood and maintained during adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57047 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>National and population-based surveys have found that adolescents often fail to meet dietary recommendations for overall nutritional status and for specific nutrient intakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>]. Many adolescents receive a higher proportion of energy from fat <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> added sugar and have a lower intake of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin A</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a>, fiber, iron, calcium, vitamin D, and zinc than is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-36</a>]. The low intake of iron and calcium among adolescent girls is of particular concern. Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly prevalent, and is associated with decreased bone density and probably fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Vitamin D deficiency is typically defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (37.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> and target concentrations for 25-hydroxyvitamin D are at least 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. Iron deficiency can impair cognitive function and physical performance, and inadequate calcium intake may increase fracture risk during adolescence and the risk of developing osteoporosis in later life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/39-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron requirements and iron deficiency in adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-requirements-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium requirements in adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Eating habits vary widely between individual adolescents, and also display some general trends over time, reflecting sociocultural trends in food availability and nutritional goals. As an example, data from six national representative surveys showed that total energy intake among us adolescents increased through 2004, then decreased through 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Seven food sources, including sugar-sweetened beverages, pizza, full-fat milk, grain-based desserts, breads, pasta dishes, and savory snacks, consistently contributed to this trend. Intakes of full-fat milk, meats, ready-to-eat cereals, burgers, fried potatoes, fruit juice, and vegetables decreased, whereas nonfat milk, poultry, sweet snacks and candies, and tortilla- and corn-based dishes increased through 2010. The changes contributing to the decline in caloric intake prior to 2010 included significant decreases in sugar-sweetened beverages, pizza, pasta dishes, bread, and savory snacks; and significant increases in fruit. </p><p>During adolescence, young people are in a transition period when they gradually take over the responsibility for their own eating habits. Knowledge is one of the factors necessary for a healthy transition of responsibility. Questionnaires used to assess nutrition knowledge demonstrate that more than two-thirds of adolescents, especially boys, adolescents from rural environments, and overweight adolescents, have unsatisfactory knowledge about dietary recommendations, sources of nutrients, diet-disease relationships, and dietary habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In this group, television was the main source of information about nutrition for adolescents.</p><p>Parents have the opportunity to influence their child's dietary intake in a variety of ways, the most important of which is the decisions made about what foods are available within their home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Nutrition education interventions focusing on spices and herbs also may be an effective tool to improve diet quality and healthy eating attitudes, especially among urban and African&ndash;American adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The addition of spices and herbs was associated with modest improvement in the consumption of grain and protein food products, as well as attitudes toward eating vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products. </p><p>This topic review discusses characteristic adolescent eating habits, including skipping meals, fast food consumption, frequent snacking, and dieting behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,49-51</a>]. The nutritional requirements for adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary energy requirements in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIPPING MEALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescents may skip meals because of irregular schedules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Breakfast and lunch are the meals most often missed, but social, school, and work activities can cause evening meals to be missed as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,53-55</a>].</p><p>On any given day, 12 to 50 percent of adolescents skip breakfast; older adolescents (those age 15 to 18 years) are twice as likely to skip breakfast as are younger adolescents, and girls are more likely to do so than are boys (35 versus 25 percent, in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,53,56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,53,56-59</a>]. In a 2015 nationally representative survey of high school students, only 36.3 percent ate breakfast for all seven days before the survey. Subgroups that were more likely to consume breakfast all seven days were the 9<sup>th</sup> grade students (39.6 percent) compared with 12<sup>th</sup> grade students (33.8 percent), and boys (40.5 percent) compared with and girls (32.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. More than one-half of the adolescents participating in the National Adolescent School Health Survey reported they ate breakfast less than twice per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Reasons for skipping breakfast include lack of time, early school activities, proximity of fast food outlets and grocery stores near schools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], or a poor appetite first thing in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,60</a>].</p><p>The omission of breakfast can affect school performance and the overall quality of the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>]. In one cross-sectional and longitudinal study of school breakfast programs, students with greater participation in the breakfast program had greater increases in math grades, decreases in child and teacher ratings of psychosocial problems, and decreases in absence and tardiness than did children with less participation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In another large-scale survey of school children from nine states, hungry children and children at risk for hunger were more likely to have impaired function, hyperactivity, absenteeism, and tardiness than were not-hungry children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Total nutrient intakes are lower among adolescents who skip breakfast as compared with those who consume breakfast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,5,64,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,64,67</a>]. Adolescent breakfast consumers have a higher intake of calories, fiber, vitamins A, B6, and B12, iron, and calcium and better overall eating habits than do adolescents who skip breakfast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/54,56,59,68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,56,59,68-71</a>]. When breakfast is consumed, it contributes to approximately one-fourth (21 to 26 percent) of total daily energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. The foods that typically are skipped with breakfast include fruits, breads, and calcium- and iron-rich foods (milk and iron-fortified cereals, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/25,54,56,74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,54,56,74-76</a>]. Adolescents who skip breakfast tend not to compensate for these losses at other meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/61,74,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,74,77</a>].</p><p>Adolescents' busy lifestyles often conflict with family mealtimes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,78,79</a>]. There is a decline in family meal frequency during adolescence, and family meals are associated with higher diet quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/25,51,75,80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,51,75,80-82</a>]. One study of 16,000 children aged 9 to 14 years demonstrates that children who eat meals with their families most or all of the time have healthier diets than do those who rarely or never do [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Compared with those who rarely eat with their families, they consume less fried food and soft drinks and more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. A five-year longitudinal study with 1700 adolescents found that family meal frequency during adolescence predicts higher intakes of fruits, dark-green and orange vegetables, and lower intakes of soft drinks during early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Adolescents, particularly females, may use skipping meals as a strategy for weight control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/50,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,84,85</a>]. However, the calories that are &quot;saved&quot; are often made up through heavy snacking on nutrient-poor foods, or by overeating at the next meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. This pattern tends to impair nutrition because <span class=\"nowrap\">high-fat/energy-dense</span> snack foods rarely compensate for the nutritional value of the meals that are skipped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Moreover, skipping meals does not seem to improve weight control, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1991 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Survey showed that adolescents who had a consistent meal pattern (at least two meals per day), were leaner than those who had an inconsistent meal pattern (one meal or snacks only per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Dutch study found that adolescents who ate breakfast on a daily basis were less likely to be overweight than those who ate breakfast irregularly or never [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study examined 2379 adolescent girls aged 9 to 10 years at baseline, and followed them until 19 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/54,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,88</a>]. Among girls with high body mass index (BMI) at baseline, those who ate breakfast more often had a lower BMI at the end of the study compared with those who ate breakfast less often. Similarly, in the full population, lower snack and eating frequencies at baseline were associated with greater gain adiposity during the 10-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study followed 9919 adolescents participating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health during the five-year transition period between adolescence and young adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H14407079\" class=\"local\">'Dietary balance'</a> below.)</p><p>Adolescents should be informed that skipping meals does not help with weight control, and indeed may promote weight gain, as discussed above. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SNACKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adolescents snack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/49,53,72,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,53,72,97,98</a>]. After approximately 12 years of age, teenagers seldom conform to a regular pattern of three meals per day; more than one-half of teens admit to eating at least five times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/50,53,57,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,53,57,98</a>]. Snacks are a major source of energy and nutrients, providing nearly one-quarter to one-third of total energy intake for many adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/50,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,99</a>]. In one study from Canada, after-school snacks represented 13 percent of total daily energy intake; the largest energy contributors were energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods such as cookies, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sweets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Depending upon their timing and composition, between-meal snacks can contribute in negative or positive ways to the adolescent diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Poorly timed snacks that are high in calories and low in nutrients (ie, &quot;junk food&quot;) may blunt the adolescent's mealtime appetite and replace nutritious foods that are needed for growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,49,50</a>]. In particular, sugar-sweetened beverages often have a negative impact on diet quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>] and also contribute to weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]. In a national survey in the United States, sugar-sweetened beverages or fruit juice comprised 10 to 15 percent of the calories consumed by children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Increased intake of sugar-sweetened beverages also may be an important predictor of cardiometabolic risk independent of weight status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Moreover, dietary sodium is associated with higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, identifying a possible link between dietary sodium and excess energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. In contrast, healthy snacks can help meet the increased energy and nutrient needs of adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Snacks that are nutrient-dense (ie, have a ratio of nutrients to calories similar to that of meals) can help to fill the &quot;nutritional gaps&quot; (eg, fiber, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin A</a>, calcium, and iron) that remain after traditional meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/1,50,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,50,107</a>].</p><p>Television viewing is associated with increased snacking among children and adolescents and also with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/58,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,108</a>]. Spending more than 120 minutes watching television is associated with significantly higher intakes of total fat and polyunsaturated fat and lower intake of several minerals and vitamins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Adolescents with high media exposure, including television and video and computer games, were more likely to drink sugar-sweetened beverages rather than water or milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Exposure to advertising of poor quality snack foods appears to be an important mechanism for the association between television viewing and food intake or obesity. In an analysis of food advertisements shown during television programs designed for children, more than 90 percent of the advertised foods were high in fat, sodium, or added sugars, or low in overall nutrients.

With busy after-school schedules, adolescents frequently eat away from home. Fast foods are popular choices because they are inexpensive, familiar, and available at almost any hour of the day or night and because many adolescents socialize with their peers at fast food establishments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/49,113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,113,114</a>].

The BMI increased by 4.63 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2</span> among adolescents using these unhealthy dieting behaviors, as compared with a BMI increase of 2.29 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2</span> among those who did not. The results suggest that weight reduction efforts reported by teenage girls are more likely to result in weight gain than in weight loss. In addition, repeated dieting is highly correlated with cycles of weight loss and gain (ie, &quot;yo-yo&quot; dieting), a risk factor for development of coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/95,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,140</a>]. </p><p>Because of the dramatic increase in the proportion of obese adolescents in the United States between 1980 and 2012 (quadrupled from 5 to 20.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/174-176\" class=\"abstract_t\">174-176</a>], dieting is a much debated issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/166,177,178\" class=\"abstract_t\">166,177,178</a>]. Unless medically indicated and guided toward healthy eating behaviors, dieting can be unhealthy for a growing adolescent even if he or she is overweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/166,179,180\" class=\"abstract_t\">166,179,180</a>]. Focusing on a well-balanced diet that includes a decrease in consumption of foods with high-energy density and increasing exercise may offer a safer alternative to food restriction for an adolescent who needs to lose weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/179,181-184\" class=\"abstract_t\">179,181-184</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care professionals play a role in educating adolescents about the normal changes in growth and development that occur during adolescence, and in helping adolescents understand that self-imposed dieting is neither healthy nor desirable for their growing bodies, and may actually increase body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/141,144-146,185\" class=\"abstract_t\">141,144-146,185</a>]. As part of the routine health maintenance examination, primary care providers should ask about body image and dieting patterns <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use a validated written measure such as the Eating Attitudes Test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60963 \">table 6</a>). Counseling or referral to a dietitian is warranted if the adolescent is using unsound dieting or weight loss practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Referral to a multidisciplinary team or professional with expertise in eating disorders is indicated if an eating disorder is suspected. The team can consist of psychiatrists or psychologists, adolescent medicine physicians, dietitians, and exercise therapists with the necessary experience in treating eating disorders.

Poor eating habits formed during adolescence can lead to obesity and diet-related diseases in later years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adolescent-eating-habits/abstract/11,12,186-188\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,186-188</a>]. In addition, the high incidence of dieting behaviors can contribute to nutritional inadequacies and to the development of eating disorders.</p><p>Primary care providers are in an optimal position to provide nutrition screening, counseling, and referral to a dietitian if needed. The American Medical Association's Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) recommend that primary health care providers provide annual guidance regarding dietary habits, including the benefits of a healthy diet, ways to improve eating habits, and safe weight management. GAPS also recommends annual screening for eating disorders and obesity. These guidelines are also consistent with those outlined by the multidisciplinary task force, Bright Futures (<a href=\"http://www.brightfutures.org/&amp;token=N7SjjQowCPqVcBtYJU+CuzpBwSgpEBlOYD+oK4VQxtLzPoEAc2qbo1qnBAVqtEnq&amp;TOPIC_ID=5361\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.brightfutures.org</a>).
