In these infants, full enteral feedings are generally delayed because of the severity of medical problems associated with prematurity, such as immature lung function (which often requires endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation), hypothermia, infections, and hypotension. In addition, early enteral feeds are also delayed because of concerns that aggressive feeding may lead to complications, such as feeding intolerance or necrotizing enterocolitis. As a result, the nutritional requirements of VLBW infants are rarely met by enteral feeds in the first two weeks after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The approach to enteral nutrition in premature infants is discussed separately.

More mature, and larger, premature infants may not require PN, because these infants usually tolerate early enteral nutrition.

The early use of adequate PN minimizes weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], improves growth and neurodevelopmental outcome, and appears to reduce the risk of mortality and later adverse outcomes, such as necrotizing enterocolitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Increased protein and energy intakes in the first week also are associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcome. In one study of 148 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) survivors (birth weight below 1000 g), increasing caloric and protein intakes during the first week after birth each were associated independently with an increase in the Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) scores at 18 months of corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Very premature infants have high nutrient needs because they lack the nutrient deposition that typically occurs in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These infants are also prone to medical conditions including hypotension, hypoxia, acidosis, hypothermia, infection, and recovery from surgical procedures that further increase metabolic energy requirements and thus nutrient needs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ENERGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951055978\"><span class=\"h2\">Energy needs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In premature infants, energy requirements must cover both energy needed for energy expenditure (resting metabolic rate, activity, and thermoregulation) and for growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The premature infant has an energy requirement of 80 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day by the end of the first week when nourished parenterally, which is generally lower than the energy requirement needed with enteral nutrition. This lower energy requirement is due to less fecal energy loss (energy excreted), and usually lower energy needs for activity and thermoregulation because of their controlled thermoneutral environment. Initially, caloric intake of 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day is given to prevent catabolism, and is advanced to the full energy needs of the infant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2189562287\"><span class=\"h2\">Macronutrient distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbohydrates and fat primarily provide the calories for energy. Protein intake, including essential amino acids, should be sufficient to attain positive nitrogen balance by covering the needs generated by protein turnover (protein catabolism) and tissue growth. The distribution of nonprotein calories derived from carbohydrates and lipids is similar to that of human milk, which is generally about 40 and 45 percent of calories from fat and carbohydrates, respectively.</p><p>Studies have shown that mixtures with a higher distribution of glucose (ie, carbohydrates) may result in adverse effects on respiratory metabolism. Surplus calories from glucose result in glucose conversion to fat, increased production of carbon dioxide, and increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), leading to an increased minute ventilation and respiratory quotient, and a possible rise in oxygen consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A balanced distribution of calories from glucose and fat favors protein accretion, while a glucose-only or glucose-predominant parenteral nutrition (PN) (ie, with minimal lipid) is associated with protein oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>As an example, a study reported that preterm infants who received a PN solution containing higher energy from glucose without a higher amino acid component had frequent episodes of hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Conversely, a reduction is glucose intake with a greater amino acid supply is associated with higher insulin secretion and normoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2547792428\" class=\"local\">'Early PN'</a> below.) </p><p>Monitoring of the intakes for all energy sources is essential to ensure that a relatively balanced distribution of calories is derived from glucose and fat. In our institution parenteral nutrition (PN) is calculated to provide about 55, 30, and 15 percent of calories as carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64194 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose is the source of carbohydrate used in parenteral nutrition (PN). Soon after birth, exogenous glucose is often needed until the infant can begin to mobilize glycogen stores and produce glucose. Premature infants are at risk for both hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes. The usual glucose need for growth and maintenance of glucose homeostasis in premature infants is 5 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/minute,</span> compared with 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/minute</span> for term infants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3108992118\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preterm infant has a higher glucose need compared with term infants because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The brain makes up a greater proportion of body weight in preterm compared with term infants, and glucose is the primary energy substrate for the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm infants have lower fat stores and delayed enzyme maturation compared with term infants, and this leads to reduced gluconeogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of prematurity such as respiratory distress and hypothermia are associated with increased energy expenditure.

The proposed reasons for this complication include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ineffective insulin secretion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End-organ insulin resistance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased glucose intracellular transporters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated catecholamines and glucocorticoids, which alter glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose production and limiting glucose utilization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of enteral nutrition, which stimulates insulin secretion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of high glucose intakes</p><p/><p>In our practice, for the ELBW infant, we start a glucose infusion rate at 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute and advance the rate daily, or as tolerated, by 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute to a maximum of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute. Infants should not need a glucose infusion rate greater than 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> unless there are underlying conditions, such as hyperinsulinemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67634 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>If an ELBW infant develops hyperglycemia, the glucose infusion rate should be minimized (by using only 5 percent glucose), before consideration of insulin therapy. Insulin therapy has been proposed to treat hyperglycemia in these patients, but no threshold glucose concentration has been adopted. High insulin infusion rates should make one suspicious that the infant may be severely limited in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> ability to utilize glucose, such as the case following a severe intraventricular hemorrhage. Neonatal hyperglycemia and its management, including insulin therapy, are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-hyperglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal hyperglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The early initiation of amino acid and lipid infusion in ELBW infants is an important strategy to prevent hyperglycemia, as they contribute substrates for gluconeogenesis, allowing for lower glucose infusion rates, thereby reducing the potential risk of hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

With no amino acid intake, very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight less than 1500 g) lose the equivalent of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of protein per day, due to protein catabolism in the first days after birth. The combined use of early amino acids and glucose infusion within their first 24 hours replaces the usual urinary nitrogen loss due to protein breakdown. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Early administration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50863086\"><span class=\"h2\">Intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In premature infants receiving parenteral nutrition (PN), an amino acid intake of 3.5 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day is needed to meet the postnatal needs, which are estimated based on the intrauterine accretion rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67634 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In our practice, we administer an amino acid intake of 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> on the day of birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64194 \">table 2</a>). Including this level of amino acids in the PN during the first few days helps to establish a positive nitrogen balance. In addition, nitrogen balance (retention) is favored by higher energy intakes, usually from 50 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>]. The provision of optimal amino acid intakes is associated with a lower risk for hyperglycemia, possibly due to stimulation of insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Early administration'</a> below.) </p><p>The benefits of this level of protein intake is supported by studies that measured a variety of outcomes. One review of the literature suggested that intakes of &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day were tolerated without adverse effects and were associated with lower rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with intakes of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Subsequent studies have failed to show an improvement in growth with higher (3.5 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day) compared with lower (2.5 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day) amino acid intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In one of the trials, there was also no difference in the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III scores at two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Higher amino acid intake was well-tolerated in all trials, although it was associated with higher blood urea nitrogen concentration. One study showed that even infants in the high amino acid intake group may have a cumulative <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/energy</span> deficit suggesting the need to maintain a higher intake dictated by the intrauterine accretion rate. In addition, one of the studies demonstrated improved glycemic control in the group assigned to a higher amino acid intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, other studies report an association between higher amino acid intakes in the first week and developmental outcome at 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other studies show that higher amino acid intake is associated with improved nitrogen balance and developmental outcome without any adverse effects on tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/9,17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The essential amino acids in PN include isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. In the premature infant, other amino acids may be conditionally essential because the premature infant has a limited ability to synthesize them. They include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cysteine</a>, glutamine, glycine, histidine, taurine, and tyrosine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The ideal mixture of amino acids for PN in premature infants is unknown. Amino acid solutions that have been designed to meet the protein requirements of premature infants are based upon the composition of breast milk. These solutions result in a more balanced plasma amino acid pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/21,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,30-32</a>], and increased weight gain and net nitrogen retention, when compared with standard amino acid formulations designed for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Amino acid preparations available for PN administration in premature infants vary in their content of essential amino acids (from 40 to 53 percent) and their composition of specific amino acids. For example, tyrosine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cysteine</a> are not present in all preparations because of difficulties in solubility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/21,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,33,34</a>]. Taurine and glutamic acid are also not present in all solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/21,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cysteine and glutamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been proposed that supplementation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cysteine</a> and glutamine will improve patient outcome. A proposed mechanism is that supplementation of these two amino acids improves glutathione synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Glutathione is a major intracellular antioxidant and its primary function is to protect cells from free-radical damage (eg, peroxides). The liver synthesizes glutathione from cysteine, glutamine, and glycine. However, this mechanism has not been proven, so our supplementation practices are based on clinical outcomes and practical considerations. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Cysteine</a> is not a component of standard PN because it must be added daily due to its stability. It is added to PN for premature infants to improve solubility of calcium and phosphorus, as well as improve nitrogen balance, and in one study it had a positive effect on weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There does not appear to be a benefit of high doses. Glutathione synthesis appears to be optimized with the doses of cysteine that are typically provided (20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> amino acids), but not with higher doses. Supplementation of cysteine lowers the pH of the mixture, which serves to augment the solubility of calcium and phosphorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Occasionally, the use of cysteine hydrochloride results in a mild metabolic acidosis, so the addition of acetate may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/22,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,40</a>].</p><p>We do not supplement with parenteral or enteral glutamine because clinical studies also have <strong>not</strong> demonstrated a benefit of supplementation. In a randomized study, increasing the proportion of glutamine compared with other amino acids in PN did not improve protein retention or weight gain, and did not reduce the risk of mortality or late-onset sepsis in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A separate study reported long-term follow-up of 52 preterm infants who participated in a randomized study of enteral glutamine supplementation during the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. When the children were evaluated at eight or nine years of age, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated increased white matter, hippocampal, and brain stem volume; these changes were mediated by a lower rate of serious infections during the neonatal period. However, the number of patients in this trial was small and 42 percent of patients were lost at the time of follow-up. It is possible that the action of enteral glutamine may differ significantly from that delivered by the parenteral route. Finally, a systematic review concluded that supplementation of parenteral or enteral glutamine did not affect mortality, incidence of invasive infection or necrotizing enterocolitis, weight gain, time to full enteral nutrition, or length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

However, subsequent studies have demonstrated either no or a very modest risk reduction with the use of pharmacologic doses of vitamin E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/90-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-97</a>]. </p><p>Some studies that administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin E</a> within 12 hours of birth reduced the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].

Na and potassium (K) supplementation is not generally required in the early, immediate PN for premature infants because infants are normally born with excessive extracellular fluid and there is a normally a sodium diuresis that occurs in the first 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>After the first 24 hours after birth, serum Na and K concentrations are monitored and supplementation is adjusted on a daily basis. In general, maintenance requirements for a growing premature infant are about 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for both Na and K. However, other sources of parenteral sodium intake, such as intravenous saline infusions or flushes used to administer medications, need to be considered when calculating the sodium requirements for PN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].

It is required to shuttle long-chain fatty acids, such as acylcarnitine, into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Carnitine is, therefore, crucial for energy production in tissues dependent upon fatty acid oxidation, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle. It is present in human milk and formula but is not included in the standard PN formulations.</p><p>In premature infants, supplementation with L-carnitine (8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) increases serum total and acylcarnitine concentrations in premature infants compared with no supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>].

Patients in the lowest growth velocity quartile also were in the lowest quartiles of protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake on day seven after birth.</p><p>These findings emphasize the importance of early nutrition on growth velocity.

The premature infant who receives parenteral nutrition has an energy need of 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day by the end of the first week. Initially, caloric intake of 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day is given to prevent catabolism, and is advanced to the full energy needs.

Exogenous glucose is needed after delivery to prevent hypoglycemia. In our practice, we start a glucose infusion rate at 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute and advance the rate daily, as tolerated, by 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute to a maximum of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute. Serum glucose should be monitored because premature infants, especially extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (birth weights &lt;1000 g ), are susceptible to both hypo- and hyperglycemia.
