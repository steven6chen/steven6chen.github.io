They are most frequently associated with upper respiratory tract syndromes such as pharyngitis or coryza but can also cause pneumonia. Less commonly, adenoviruses cause gastrointestinal, ophthalmologic, genitourinary, neurologic, and disseminated disease. Most adenoviral diseases are self-limiting, although fatal infections can occur in immunocompromised hosts and occasionally in healthy children and adults.</p><p>The available diagnostic tests and strategies for treatment and prevention of adenovirus infection will be reviewed here. The virology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18818874\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since adenoviruses are associated with a variety of clinical syndromes and nonspecific manifestations, diagnosis based upon clinical criteria alone is challenging. The diagnosis of adenovirus disease should be confirmed in outbreaks of infection and in individual patients with serious disease manifestations. Confirmation of adenovirus infection is important in order to decide on the use of antiviral agents, exclude other treatable infections, establish a prognosis, and initiate infection control measures when appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different approaches are available for the specific diagnosis of adenovirus infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59727\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59727 \">table 1</a>). Viral culture, adenovirus-specific viral antigen assays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are used most frequently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All adenovirus serotypes except types 40 and 41 cause a characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) in human epithelial cell lines such as HeLa, A549, or HEp2 and in primary human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. CPE generally occurs within 2 to 7 days with the common lower serotypes, but some others, especially subgroup D serotypes (which cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis), can require up to 28 days.</p><p>Adenoviruses are relatively stable and can be readily recovered from clinical samples early in the course of the disease. Appropriate samples include nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates, throat swabs or washes, sputum, tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, conjunctival swabs or scrapings, stool or rectal swabs, urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue samples. Swabs and tissue biopsies should be placed in a viral transport medium to prevent drying and to inhibit bacterial overgrowth. Specimens should be transported to the laboratory on ice. The duration of viral excretion at the time of acute disease is approximately one to three days from throat in adults with upper respiratory infection; three to five days from nose, throat, and eye in patients with pharyngoconjunctival fever; and two weeks from eye cultures in patients with keratoconjunctivitis. Viral excretion may be prolonged (for weeks) in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>After acute infection, adenoviruses may be intermittently excreted in stool (or upper respiratory tract, less commonly) for months in some patients. In immunocompromised hosts, adenoviruses may be continuously shed from stool or urine for months without symptoms. Therefore, a positive culture result needs to be interpreted based upon the current clinical manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral antigen assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct detection of adenovirus antigens in clinical samples may be performed by an adenovirus-specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescence assay. These assays are more rapid but less sensitive than viral culture for the detection of most serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. They are insufficiently sensitive for diagnosis in immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Commercially available assays use adenovirus-specific monoclonal antibodies that react with common antigenic determinants on all serotypes. In particular, antigen assays are the test of choice for the detection of the fastidious adenovirus types 40 and 41 in stool samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These enteric adenoviruses are an important cause of diarrhea in infants.</p><p>Another potential application for direct antigen assays is in the rapid diagnosis of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). The Adenoclone-EIA (Cambridge Biotech) was evaluated as a rapid diagnostic test for adenoviral ocular infection applied to conjunctival swabs from 372 culture-positive infected eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The overall sensitivity of the EIA was only 38 percent, but, in swabs obtained within the first week of illness, the sensitivity improved to 65 percent. Therefore, this assay may be a useful adjunct to routine viral culture early in the course of the illness.</p><p>Direct adenovirus antigen assays can also be used to screen cell cultures before the development of CPE, as well as to confirm the presence of adenovirus in cell cultures positive for CPE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymerase chain reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCR is a highly sensitive and specific assay that can be used to detect adenovirus DNA from a variety of clinical specimens including fixed tissues. PCR is particularly helpful in samples from normally sterile sites such as blood, CSF, and tissues. A positive result from upper respiratory tract or stool samples is more difficult to interpret as it may represent virus shedding rather than symptomatic infection. Therefore, PCR results must be interpreted in the context of the clinical findings of adenovirus disease. Because different adenovirus serotypes are heterogeneous at the DNA level, PCR primers may be selected to detect specific serotypes or related serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Commercial adenovirus PCR assays use universal primers and probes that detect most or all serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Detection of adenovirus DNA in the blood by quantitative PCR is increasingly utilized for the evaluation of adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. Studies have demonstrated an association between rising or high-level viremia and the risk of both invasive disease and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In addition, quantification of adenovirus DNA can be used to assess response to antiviral treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. In one study, a greater than 10-fold decrease in viral load one week after the first dose of antiviral therapy was associated with a favorable clinical course, whereas all patients with fatal disease failed to show a significant reduction in viral load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. PCR can also be used in conjunction with sequencing in order to rapidly genotype adenovirus isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18818704\" class=\"local\">'Serotyping and genotyping'</a> below.)</p><p>PCR has been used to diagnose adenovirus myocarditis. Routine viral cultures and histopathology are rarely positive in cases of presumed viral myocarditis. In one study, 38 myocardial tissue samples from 34 patients with acute myocarditis and 17 control patients with congenital heart disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were tested by PCR for adenovirus and enterovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although enteroviruses have been implicated as the major etiology of viral myocarditis, adenovirus DNA was detected more commonly (15 samples) than enterovirus DNA (8 samples). All control samples were negative. In another report, PCR was used to make a diagnosis of intrauterine adenovirus myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;, section on 'Adenovirus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;, section on 'Identifying the cause of myocarditis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in children&quot;, section on 'Endomyocardial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, detection of adenovirus by PCR in heart biopsies of cardiac transplant recipients may correlate with increased graft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathologic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive diagnosis of adenovirus disease may require tissue biopsy. Specimens should be obtained for both pathology and viral culture or PCR because routine histopathology may be nonspecific, especially in the early stages of infections.</p><p>Adenoviruses can cause characteristic intranuclear inclusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56007\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56007 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Early post-infection, cells may display small eosinophilic inclusions. During the later stages of infection, basophilic inclusions appear, which initially may be surrounded by a clear halo within the nucleus. When these intranuclear inclusions enlarge and obscure the nuclear membrane, the cells are referred to as &quot;smudge&quot; cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56007\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56007 \">picture 1</a>). Occasionally, adenovirus inclusions may be confused with cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusions, but, unlike CMV, adenoviruses cause neither intracytoplasmic inclusions nor multinucleated cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>If routine histopathology is non-diagnostic and viral culture of tissue is negative (or not done), more specialized tests may be performed on tissue samples. Electron microscopy can be used to detect the characteristic icosahedral virions that typically form large paracrystalline aggregates with the nuclei of infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Adenovirus-specific immunohistochemical assays and in situ DNA assays are also available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recent infection may be documented by assay of paired acute and convalescent sera for adenovirus-specific antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It is important to document a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer because there is a high prevalence of anti-adenovirus antibodies in the general population, and there are numerous cross-reactions between related serotypes.</p><p>Commercially available EIAs and complement fixation assays measure adenovirus-specific anti-hexon antibodies but do not provide information about the serotype. In contrast, detection of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies or neutralizing antibodies is more sensitive and is serotype specific. These assays are primarily performed in reference laboratories and are best interpreted when the patient's sera is tested against the patient's own isolate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18818704\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotyping and genotyping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After recovery of a clinical isolate on tissue culture, further evaluation can be performed by serotype analysis in a reference virology laboratory. Certain serotypes are associated with distinct clinical manifestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63104 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The serotype is determined by first grouping the isolate by hemagglutination pattern with rat and rhesus red blood cells. Then, hemagglutination inhibition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum neutralization assays can be performed using a selected panel of type-specific sera. Genotyping can also be accomplished by PCR and sequencing, which is substantially faster than the traditional serotyping methods, although it is not widely available. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reactions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18818726\"><span class=\"h2\">Restriction endonuclease analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restriction endonuclease (RE) analysis can distinguish between different clinical isolates of the same serotype. RE analysis is useful for epidemiologic analysis (eg, during outbreaks of adenovirus infection). As an example, RE was used to analyze isolates obtained during an outbreak of EKC caused by adenovirus serotype 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this epidemic, cases occurred simultaneously in two childcare centers, followed by prolonged outbreaks within the community and among staff at the local hospital. RE analysis of the genomes of five isolates revealed they were identical and distinct from the prototype adenovirus serotype 8, supporting the conclusion that the cases in the larger outbreak were connected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTS OF CHOICE FOR DIFFERENT ADENOVIRUS SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic test of choice varies depending upon the clinical scenario (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81573 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper respiratory illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenoviruses should be suspected as one of the causes of febrile illnesses with respiratory symptoms in infants and young children. Adenoviruses are a common cause of tonsillitis in young children. Conjunctivitis accompanied by pharyngeal symptoms, known as pharyngoconjunctival fever, is a characteristic, though less frequent, adenovirus syndrome. Adenoviruses are also implicated in outbreaks of febrile respiratory disease in summer camps and swimming pools.

EKC is highly contagious and often occurs in outbreaks. It is best to obtain conjunctival swabs for both viral culture and adenovirus-specific ELISA or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to make a diagnosis of EKC, since subgroup D isolates, which are frequently implicated, can take two to four weeks to grow in tissue culture.</p><p>The differential diagnosis includes bacterial conjunctivitis as well as other viral pathogens such as enteroviruses and herpes simplex virus.

Adenovirus infections commonly occur in immunocompromised children resulting from either reactivation of latent infection or primary infection. Because adenoviruses may be shed asymptomatically in throat, stool, or urine, it is often necessary to obtain tissue to diagnose some types of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;, section on 'Infections in immunocompromised hosts'</a>.)</p><p>Adenoviruses may cause severe, sometimes fatal, disease in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.

PCR, viral culture, or direct antigen assays of upper nasopharyngeal, throat, urine, and stool or rectal samples will detect viral shedding. Results should be interpreted in the context of clinical manifestations consistent with adenovirus infection. In addition, testing of blood and affected sites (including lower respiratory tract secretions collected by tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with pneumonia; urine in patients with hemorrhagic cystitis; cerebrospinal fluid in patients with central nervous system involvement; and tissue biopsy in patients with pneumonia, colitis, nephritis, or hepatitis) may be needed to diagnose adenovirus infection. Quantitative PCR of blood is helpful to establish a diagnosis, evaluate risk for dissemination and prognosis, and monitor response to antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/14-18,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18,37</a>].</p><p>As has been shown for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, early identification of patients at risk for adenovirus disease by monitoring for viremia by PCR is beneficial; thus, some centers have adopted routine weekly surveillance measures for pediatric recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/14,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,38-40</a>]. If viremia is detected, then patients should be carefully evaluated for evidence of disease, such as pneumonia, hepatitis, cystitis, and colitis, and specimens should be obtained for adenovirus testing from affected sites.
