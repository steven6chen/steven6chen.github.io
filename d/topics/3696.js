The most essential and often earliest clinical manifestation of AD is selective memory impairment, although there are exceptions. While treatments are available that can ameliorate some symptoms of the illness, there is no cure or disease-modifying therapy (treatment that slows the course of the illness) currently available, and the disease inevitably progresses in all patients.</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AD. Other topics review the risk factors and treatment of AD and the clinical manifestations of other causes of dementia and cognitive impairment.

It is exceptional for AD to occur before age 60. The incidence and prevalence of AD increase exponentially with age, essentially doubling in prevalence every 5 years after the age of 65 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease#H617807629\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Incidence and prevalence'</a>.)</p><p>Early-onset AD (onset of symptoms before 65 years of age) is unusual, and many of these patients present for evaluation due to concerns about job performance. Many of these patients have no clear familial pattern and thus would be considered sporadic, although some exhibit familial clustering. People with early-onset AD often present with atypical symptoms, including language, visual, or mood-behavioral changes.</p><p>There are rare inherited forms of AD that routinely present before 65 years of age, and frequently in the fifth decade or earlier. These account for less than one percent of all cases of AD. They typically exhibit an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern related to mutations in genes that alter beta-amyloid (A&beta;) protein production or metabolism, including amyloid precursor protein (<em>APP</em>), presenilin-1 (<em>PSEN1</em>), and presenilin-2 (<em>PSEN2</em>). In a meta-analysis with individual-level data on 1307 patients with autosomal dominant AD, the mean age of symptom onset was 46 years and was highly correlated with parental age of onset and mutation type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with <em>PSEN1</em> mutations had the earliest median age of onset (43 years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97086 \">figure 1</a>). The range of symptom onset across all mutation types is nonetheless fairly broad, with some presentations in the fourth decade and some mutations not manifesting symptoms until the seventh decade (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-onset-dementia-in-adults#H201302195\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early-onset dementia in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurodegenerative dementias'</a>). Individuals with Down syndrome, who have an additional gene dose of <em>APP</em> due to trisomy of chromosome 21, inevitably develop AD pathology, and symptoms emerge at an earlier age, 10 to 20 years younger than the general population with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease#H912645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Trisomy 21'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406197563\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardinal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Memory impairment is the most common initial symptom of AD dementia. In patients with the typical form of the illness, deficits in other cognitive domains may appear with or after the development of memory impairment. Executive dysfunction and visuospatial impairment are often present relatively early, while deficits in language and behavioral symptoms often manifest later in the disease course. These deficits develop and progress insidiously. Less commonly, language deficits, visuospatial abnormalities, or even executive functions may be impaired as the most prominent initial symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Memory impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even when not the primary complaint, memory deficits can be elicited in most patients with AD at the time of presentation. </p><p>The pattern of memory impairment in AD is distinctive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Declarative episodic memory (memory of events occurring at a particular time and place) is usually profoundly affected in AD. This type of memory depends heavily on the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures. By contrast, subcortical systems supporting procedural memory and motor learning are relatively spared until quite late in the disease. Memory for facts such as vocabulary and concepts (semantic memory) often becomes impaired somewhat later. Semantic memory is supported by neocortical temporal regions, particularly in the anterior temporal lobe.</p><p>Within episodic memory, there is a distinction between immediate recall (eg, mental rehearsal of a phone number), memory for recent events (which comes into play once material that has departed from consciousness must be recalled), and memory of more distant events (remote memory). Memory for recent events, served by the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and related structures in the medial temporal lobe, is prominently impaired in early AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. By contrast, immediate memory (encoded in the sensory association and prefrontal cortices) is spared early on, as are memories that are consolidated for long periods of time (years), which can be recalled without hippocampal function.</p><p>The early memory deficit in AD is most precisely described as anterograde long-term episodic amnesia. Long-term memory can encompass time frames from less than a minute to years, but because the absolute time interval over which long-term memory can fail may actually be short (eg, inability to recall a few words after a couple minutes of distraction), patients and caregivers typically describe &quot;short-term memory&quot; problems. For this reason, we try to avoid the confusion afforded by the technical terms of long-term and short-term memory and use the term &quot;recent memory impairment&quot; to refer to the characteristic impairment.</p><p>Memory deficits develop insidiously and progress slowly over time, evolving to include deficits of semantic memory and immediate recall. Impairments of procedural memory appear only in late stages of AD.</p><p>Memory is usually tested by asking patients to learn and recall a series of words or objects immediately and then at a delay of 5 to 10 minutes. Impaired ability to recall objects with selective cues (hints) or recognize items as previously studied on a recognition memory test represents a more severe deficit and one that may be particularly specific for AD in its early presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Questions about orientation and recent current events are also useful memory tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-mental-status-examination-in-adults#H28388614\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The mental status examination in adults&quot;, section on 'Memory'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should compare an informant's report with the patient's report of symptoms of memory loss in daily life, recognizing that many older individuals are unreliable reporters of their own memory impairment and can both overestimate and underestimate their deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, lack of insight may cause patients to deny or under-report their symptoms. It is critical to obtain the perspective of someone who knows the patient well. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Executive function and judgment/problem solving</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In early stages of AD, impairment in executive function may range from subtle to prominent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Family members and coworkers may find the patient less organized or less motivated; multitasking is often particularly compromised. In addition to poor insight, reduced ability for abstract reasoning may be elicited. As the disease progresses, an inability to complete tasks typically emerges.</p><p>Reduced insight into deficits (anosognosia) is a common, but variable feature of AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. It is common for patients to underestimate their deficits and offer alibis or explanations for them when they are pointed out. Interviewing an informant who has known the patient over time (usually a family member) is necessary; often it is the family member, not the patient, who brings the complaint of cognitive impairment to medical attention.</p><p>Loss of insight increases over time along with overall disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Such loss of insight may be associated with behavioral disturbances. Those with relatively preserved insight are more likely to be depressed; those with more impaired insight are likely to be agitated, disinhibited, and exhibit psychotic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Lack of insight also may impact safety, as patients may attempt to take on tasks that they no longer have the capacity to perform effectively (eg, driving). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety and societal issues related to dementia&quot;, section on 'Driving'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral and psychologic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in AD, particularly in the middle and late course of disease. These can begin with relatively subtle symptoms including apathy, social disengagement, and irritability. Apathy can be difficult to distinguish from depression, which can be difficult to diagnose in the setting of dementia, and the differences should be sought diligently because of treatment implications. In some cases empiric treatment of presumed depression is a reasonable management decision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia#H1560970861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;, section on 'Depression'</a>.) </p><p>More problematic in patient management is the emergence of behavioral disturbances, including agitation, aggression, wandering, and psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, misidentification syndromes). A concomitant medical illness, medication toxicity, and other causes of delirium should be considered whenever new behavioral disturbances arise, especially if acute or subacute. The behavioral disturbances associated with AD are discussed in detail separately.

Before it is clinically manifest, dyspraxia can be elicited by asking the patient to perform ideomotor tasks, ie, pantomime the use of tools (eg, &quot;show me how you would use a comb&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Clinical dyspraxia leads to progressive difficulty first with complex, multi-step motor activities, then with dressing, using utensils to eat, and other self-care tasks and is a big contributor to dependency in mid to late stages of AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406198009\"><span class=\"h3\">Olfactory dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in olfactory function are common in patients with AD and have been explored as a diagnostic tool.

Patients with AD spend more time in bed awake and have more fragmented sleep compared with older adults without AD. Such changes may occur very early in the disease process, including in patients who are cognitively normal but have biomarker evidence of beta-amyloid (A&beta;) deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].

Younger patients, including those with autosomal dominant forms of AD, may be at higher risk for seizures, which may occur early in the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>The predominant seizure type is focal nonmotor with impaired awareness, with symptoms often suggestive of medial temporal lobe onset (eg, amnestic spells, unexplained emotions, metallic taste, rising epigastric sensation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

While pyramidal and extrapyramidal motor signs, myoclonus, and seizures do occur in patients with AD, these are typically late-stage findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. If these are clinically apparent in early to middle stages, an alternative diagnosis should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Myoclonus may emerge in some patients with AD, typically those with more rapid than usual decline.

Distinguishing these cases from other causes of dementia can be challenging. Neuropathologic studies in such patients have found Alzheimer pathology with an atypical neuroanatomic distribution (particularly neurofibrillary tangles) that corresponds with the anatomy of the most prominent clinical deficits; neuroimaging studies often have corresponding findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/41-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-46</a>]. Some case series suggest that these atypical forms are more common in early-onset presentations (before 65 years of age) in patients who do not carry one of the autosomal dominant familial mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior cortical atrophy</strong> &mdash; This syndrome manifests with progressive cortical visual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/40,44,49-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,44,49-54</a>].

That said, misdiagnosis is almost always another neurodegenerative or non-reversible cause. The clinical criteria for AD are based on a history of insidious onset and progressive course, exclusion of other etiologies, and documentation of cognitive impairments in one or more domains. A detailed cognitive and general neurologic examination is paramount.

Brain MRI can document potential alternative or additional diagnoses including cerebrovascular disease, other structural diseases (chronic subdural hematoma, cerebral neoplasm, normal pressure hydrocephalus), and regional brain atrophy suggesting frontotemporal dementia or other types of neurodegenerative disease.

In general, these findings are nonspecific. The most characteristic focal finding in AD is reduced hippocampal volume or medial temporal lobe atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/45,92-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,92-95</a>].

The finding of hippocampal atrophy provides incremental support for a diagnosis of AD in a patient with a typical clinical presentation, but it is not sufficiently specific to contribute significantly to the accuracy of the diagnosis over the clinical assessment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Some studies have suggested that MRI features may predict rate of decline of AD and in the future may guide treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/78,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,98</a>]. Hippocampal volumetry using age-corrected norms available from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative can predict conversion rates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. However, these findings require independent confirmation and the tools to generate these measurements are not widely available.</p><p>Functional brain imaging with [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), functional MRI (fMRI), perfusion MRI, or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reveals distinct regions of low metabolism (PET) and hypoperfusion (SPECT, fMRI) in AD. These areas include the hippocampus, the precuneus (mesial parietal lobes), the lateral parietal and posterior temporal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/10,100-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,100-105</a>].

FDG-PET and SPECT are the only functional neuroimaging methods that are currently reasonably widely available for clinical use.</p><p>Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) tracers (F18-florbetapir, F18-flutemetamol, F18-florbetaben) that measure amyloid lesion burden in the brain have been developed as tools to aid in the diagnosis of AD in vivo, aid in prognosis, speed development of anti-amyloid drugs, and differentiate AD from other causes of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/109-132\" class=\"abstract_t\">109-132</a>].

Since there are issues with how much ligand binding to plaques constitutes a &quot;positive&quot; scan, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval specifies that an amyloid PET scan that is negative decreases the likelihood that a patient with dementia has AD. In a symptomatic dementia patient, a positive scan indicates that the person has AD pathology, but it is important to keep in mind that such a finding does not rule out a coexisting pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia#H111521752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging studies in the evaluation of dementia&quot;, section on 'Indications for functional and molecular imaging'</a>.)</p><p>A consensus opinion of the Amyloid Imaging Task Force, the Society of Nuclear Medicine, and the Alzheimer's Association concluded that amyloid imaging is not appropriate in patients who meet the core clinical criteria for probable AD and have a typical age of onset, and such a scan should not be used to determine dementia severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Amnestic MCI'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mild cognitive impairment: Prognosis and treatment&quot;, section on 'Progression to dementia'</a>.)</p><p>Formal clinical diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD have been developed by a panel convened by the NIA-AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A concern regarding cognition reported by the patient or informant or observed by clinician</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Objective evidence of impairment in one or more cognitive domains that is not explained by age or education</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of independence in functional abilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not demented</p><p/><p>MCI may occur as a prodrome to several neurodegenerative dementias, as well as non-neurodegenerative conditions (eg, depression, medicine effects). Therefore, the specific designation of MCI due to AD is used when a biomarker associated with AD (eg, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] testing of A&beta;, tau, phospo-tau), amyloid imaging, apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) genotype, or functional scan consistent with AD is present in the affected subject (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97451 \">table 2</a>). Using the NIA-AA criteria on a cohort of research subjects with MCI, individuals with cognitive impairment and both amyloid and neuronal injury biomarkers had an approximately 60 percent conversion rate to AD dementia over three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>].</p><p>The International Working Group (IWG) recognizes a similar clinical presentation that, when accompanied by biomarker evidence of AD, is referred to as prodromal AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/140,161\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,161</a>]. The designation of prodromal AD has been associated with similar conversion rates compared with the NIA-AA criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406204401\"><span class=\"h2\">Preclinical Alzheimer disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preclinical AD refers to the stage of AD in which the molecular pathology of AD is already present in the brain but is not yet clinically expressed. Individuals are by definition asymptomatic and cognitively normal. Preclinical AD is defined by biomarker or genetic data and is primarily only recommended for use in research, in the context of clinical trials for early intervention strategies and the longitudinal study of people at risk. According to the IWG, preclinical AD encompasses two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic at risk for AD refers to cognitively normal individuals with evidence of AD molecular pathology by laboratory or imaging biomarkers. It is not currently known whether progression to symptomatic AD is inevitable in such individuals. Autopsy data revealing that people may die with normal cognition and pathologic changes of AD sufficient to make a diagnosis suggest that symptomatic AD will not occur in every subject with amyloid in the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presymptomatic AD also refers to cognitively normal and asymptomatic carriers of a dominantly inherited gene mutation that causes AD. Symptoms of AD will almost certainly develop in these individuals over a normal lifespan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease#H6562978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Early-onset Alzheimer disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The NIA-AA framework proposes three stages of preclinical AD, recognizing that some individuals will not progress beyond stage 1 or stage 2, and that individuals in stage 3 are probably most likely to progress to MCI and AD dementia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97452 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>]. These are research criteria that have not yet been validated through longitudinal studies, and they are not currently recommended for use outside a research setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406198381\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common disorders considered in the differential diagnosis of AD are vascular dementia and other neurodegenerative dementias. The two most common neurodegenerative dementias after AD are dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular dementia is caused by either ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. The most common form is due to small vessel cerebrovascular disease. Diagnosis is most specific if there is a stroke-like course of illness, neurologic signs of stroke on examination, and imaging evidence of stroke. However, the course of illness may appear smoothly progressive, and there may be no elementary neurologic signs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vascular-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DLB may be the second most common type of degenerative dementia after AD. Clinical features that help distinguish this from AD include prominent early appearance of visual hallucinations, along with parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, dysautonomia, sleep disorders, and neuroleptic sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FTD is a neuropathologically and clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by focal degeneration of the frontal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temporal lobes. Early alteration of personality, behavior, and executive functioning distinguish behavioral variant FTD from AD, however, it can be difficult to distinguish FTD from AD as a cause of primary progressive aphasia, especially early in the course. In addition, Alzheimer pathology is often found in patients with the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Atypical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Diagnosis before age 60 years is exceptional. The incidence increases exponentially with age over 65 years. Early-onset AD is unusual, and in some but not all cases is familial. Familial early-onset AD makes up less than one percent of cases (several hundred families around the world) and often follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. (See <a href=\"#H2086824550\" class=\"local\">'Age of onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive deficits in AD appear and progress insidiously. Memory impairment, specifically loss of memory of recent events, is the most frequent feature of AD and is usually its first manifestation. Deficits in other cognitive domains may appear with or after the development of memory impairment. Executive dysfunction and impaired visuospatial skills tend to be affected relatively early, while deficits in language function and behavioral symptoms often manifest later in the disease course. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms are common in middle and late stages of AD. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral and psychologic symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncognitive neurologic deficits (pyramidal and extrapyramidal motor signs, myoclonus, and seizures) can occur in late stages of AD but are uncommon in early and middle stages. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Other signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical presentations of AD have been described. These include a visual variant (posterior cortical atrophy) and some cases of primary progressive aphasia. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Atypical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AD is inexorably progressive, but the rate of progression can vary. The average life expectancy has been reported to be between three and eight years. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AD is made by clinical assessment. AD should be suspected in any older adult with insidious onset, progressive decline in memory and at least one other cognitive domain leading to impaired functioning. The role of laboratory and imaging investigations is mainly to exclude other diagnoses. Neuropsychologic testing may provide confirmatory information and aid in patient management. Biomarker data can be supportive of a diagnosis of AD but are not yet adequately standardized to incorporate into routine clinical diagnostic algorithms. (See <a href=\"#H406198475\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H406198512\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiologic process of AD begins well before clinical symptoms arise, and this period may be the optimal time to intervene if disease-modifying therapies can be identified. Laboratory and imaging biomarkers of AD are increasingly used in research settings in an effort to better define prodromal and preclinical forms of AD and identify candidates for early-intervention clinical trials.
