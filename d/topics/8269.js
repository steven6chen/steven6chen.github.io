It is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. Histologic transformation (HT) refers to the evolution of a clinically indolent NHL (eg, FL) to a clinically aggressive NHL (eg, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, DLBCL) defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in months.</p><p>HT of FL occurs at a rate of approximately 1 to 3 percent per year, and is associated with rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of extranodal sites, development of systemic symptoms, elevated serum LDH, and often a poor prognosis.</p><p>The largest body of information dealing with HT is related to its occurrence in FL, which will be the focus of this review. HT has also been observed in other clinically indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and small lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/chronic</span> lymphocytic leukemia <span class=\"nowrap\">(SLL/CLL)</span>. HT that occurs in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">SLL/CLL</span> has been termed Richter's transformation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Richter's transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of HT in patients with FL will be discussed here. Richter&rsquo;s transformation is discussed separately, as is the diagnosis and management of FL that has not undergone HT.

Data are largely extrapolated from studies performed prior to the general incorporation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> into initial treatment. In these studies, the cumulative incidence of HT in FL varies from 10 to 70 percent and is dependent on the definition of HT, length of follow-up, and whether biopsies or autopsies were performed to document HT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. In general, however, these risks have been reported to range from 1.4 to 4.4 percent per year through at least 10 to 15 years post diagnosis, as shown in the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two series of patients with FL the probability of HT was 17 to 22 percent at five years and 28 to 31 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. In one of these series, no instances of HT were seen after 16 years, at which time the cumulative probability of HT was 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based analysis of 600 patients with FL diagnosed and treated in Canada followed for a median of 109 months reported that 28 percent developed HT at an annual risk of 3 percent; this risk continued, without plateau, beyond 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study reported an incidence of HT in FL of 20 percent at a median follow up of seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective observational series of 630 patients with newly diagnosed grade 1 to 3a FL followed for a median of 60 months, 60 patients (11 percent) developed HT, with an estimated rate of 2 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

These include alterations in genes regulating proliferation, control of the cell cycle, DNA damage response, and programmed cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Mutations of the TP53 gene have been reported in 26 percent and 80 percent of cases of transformed FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. TP53 is similarly inactivated in approximately 20 percent of transformed MALT lymphomas by deletion or mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a report of serial biopsies from patients with FL, TP53 mutations were observed in 28 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although TP53 mutations were not present at diagnosis, in subsequent biopsies where the histology remained FL, 14 percent of cases had mutations, providing evidence that TP53 mutations can precede HT, occurring from six months to four years prior to transformation.</p><p>Given the central role of the B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) gene in DLBCL, investigators have examined BCL-6 alterations in HT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In one study, BCL-6 translocations or deletions were reported in 39 percent of patients with FL who went on to develop HT, versus 14 percent in those that did not transform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, both loss and gain of BCL-6 translocations were observed, suggesting that BCL-6 translocation is not required for HT.

Overexpression is typically due to a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 18 and one of the three immunoglobulin genes. In one study, mutations in the BCL-2 coding sequence were found in 12 percent of cases at diagnosis and 53 percent at HT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. BCL-2 mutations at diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of transformation (hazard ratio 3.6) and shorter median survival (9 versus 20 years). </p><p>At the time of transformation, approximately one-quarter of cases meet criteria for &quot;double-hit&quot; lymphoma, a term used for cases that have translocations of both the c-MYC gene at 8q24 and a second site, either BCL-2 or BCL-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. While &quot;double-hit&quot; lymphoma is associated with a worse prognosis in newly diagnosed DLBCL, the prognostic impact of these mutations on HT is not well established. However, as in de novo DLBCL, for patients with double-hit HT we favor more aggressive chemotherapy regimens (eg, da-EPOCH-R) rather than standard R-CHOP.

GEP has been used in FL to better understand the pathogenesis of histologic transformation and to develop prognostic models to identify patients with aggressive or more indolent disease at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. When assessed at the time of transformation, the majority of cases (approximately 80 percent) will have a pattern consistent with a germinal center B cell (GCB) cell of origin, the prognostic impact of which has not been clearly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Such &quot;pluripotency&quot; signatures were rich in the expression of genes that are typically expressed by embryonic stem cells and had reduced expression of genes typically expressed by stromal cells. This suggests that patients with a FL GEP closer to an embryonic stem cell may be more likely to transform into a more aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype.</p><p>Another study examined paired specimens from 12 patients with HT of FL using GEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Of the known genes, only one oncogene, c-myc, previously associated with HT was identified. Fifteen c-myc-regulated genes were also significantly altered in expression. Further analysis found that cases segregated into groups with increased or decreased expression of c-myc-regulated genes and a group with no significant change in these genes. Since c-myc controls proliferation as well as programmed cell death, increased expression of c-myc-regulated genes may enhance proliferation, whereas decreased expression may impede programmed cell death contributing to HT via other mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The predictive value of GEP may be limited if HT is not inherent at initial diagnosis of FL, but rather reflects the progressive accumulation of additional genetic changes leading to a histologically and clinically distinct entity. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21731973\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21731562\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect HT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should suspect histologic transformation (HT) in a patient with previously-diagnosed follicular lymphoma (FL) who has developed rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of uncommon extranodal sites (excluding the bone marrow), development of systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, night sweats), sudden decline in performance status, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercalcemia.

Therapy directed at the palliation of symptoms alone may be appropriate for patients unlikely to tolerate the toxicity of more aggressive therapy. The most commonly employed treatment regimens for patients with histologic transformation (HT) include conventional chemotherapy with immunotherapy (eg, R-CHOP or its variants) and high-dose therapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Radiation therapy is usually reserved for palliation. In the absence of randomized trials, treatment choice is largely guided by data from observational studies and retrospective analyses. Whenever possible, patients should be encouraged to enroll on clinical trials.

Prior to the advent of rituximab containing regimens, CHOP was compared with many other anthracycline-based regimens in prospective randomized trials. These regimens were associated with increased toxicity but offered no improvement in remission rate, disease-free survival, or overall survival. As such, most studies of rituximab in DLBCL have used CHOP as the chemotherapy backbone, supporting R-CHOP as the preferred chemoimmunotherapy regimen in DLBCL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important exception is patients who present with HT after having already received R-CHOP chemotherapy. Further R-CHOP would place these patients at high risk for developing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. As such, for patients who have received prior R-CHOP, we suggest the use of R-ICE (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) or a similar regimen such as that used in relapsed DLBCL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76030 \">table 6</a>). There is a paucity of data regarding the use of these other regimens in this setting. Support for their use comes from extrapolation of data from patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.

Consolidation with high dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is only offered to patients with chemotherapy sensitive disease who have a high risk of early relapse. While we know that a proportion of patients with HT will attain a sustained remission following chemoimmunotherapy alone, it is very difficult to identify these patients at the time of diagnosis. Clinicians differ in their selection of patients for consolidation therapy. In general, we offer consolidation to patients who have received extensive prior therapy. We do not offer maintenance or consolidation to patients who have received minimal prior therapy. Examples of minimal prior therapy include those who received single modality therapy with radiation or immunotherapy.</p><p>The greatest experience with consolidation comes from studies that have used high dose therapy followed by autologous HCT. No prospective studies have evaluated the use of other consolidation methods (eg, maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) in this patient population.

There have been no prospective trials evaluating the use of maintenance therapy in patients with HT. Maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> is commonly employed after chemoimmunotherapy for newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma (FL). In contrast, maintenance therapy does not appear to improve survival among patients who have completed initial chemoimmunotherapy for DLBCL. The use of maintenance rituximab in these two settings is discussed in detail separately.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been offered to these patients in an attempt to decrease the rate of relapse. The largest experience is with the use of autologous HCT.</p><p>No randomized trials have compared autologous HCT with allogeneic HCT in this setting. A nonrandomized multicenter cohort study from the Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group reported outcomes of patients with HT who underwent allogeneic HCT (22 patients), autologous HCT (46 patients), or were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> containing chemotherapy without HCT (53 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Transplant-related mortality at five years was 23 percent after allogeneic HCT and 5 percent after autologous HCT.</p><p>The lower transplant-related mortality rate and greater experience with autologous HCT in this setting supports our preference for autologous HCT rather than allogeneic HCT as consolidation therapy for most patients with advanced stage disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those who have received extensive prior therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h4\">Autologous HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrospective analyses have evaluated autologous HCT in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease and a good performance status after HT of FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/51,53-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53-63</a>].

Additional information and instructions for referring a patient to an appropriate research center can be obtained from the United States National Institutes of Health (<a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDpbZTpeZvuNaOE2M5VxYDS&amp;TOPIC_ID=5431\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic transformation (HT) refers to the histologic evolution of a clinically indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype (eg, follicular lymphoma [FL]) to a clinically aggressive subtype (eg, diffuse large B cell lymphoma [DLBCL]). In patients with FL, HT occurs at a rate of approximately 3 percent per year. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of transformation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should suspect HT in a patient with previously-diagnosed FL who has developed rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of uncommon extranodal sites (excluding the bone marrow), development of systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, night sweats), elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercalcemia. The emergence of foci of intense uptake on imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) should also raise the suspicion of HT. (See <a href=\"#H21731562\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect HT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HT of FL requires a biopsy of involved tissue (usually a lymph node) that demonstrates loss of the follicular architecture and the accumulation of large tumor cells that resemble those of DLBCL, Burkitt lymphoma, or another clinically aggressive or highly aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79473\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79473 \">picture 1</a>). Importantly, FL that evolves from low to high grade (eg, grade I to grade IIIa) is <strong>not</strong> considered HT. (See <a href=\"#H21731522\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3130572\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to initiating therapy, a pretreatment evaluation must establish the extent and sites of disease and the performance status of the patient. Patients with HT are generally classified for management purposes as having either limited stage disease or advanced stage disease based upon whether the tumor can be contained within one irradiation field. (See <a href=\"#H7778996\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation and staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whenever possible, patients should be encouraged to enroll on clinical trials. Outside of a clinical trial, our preferred therapy depends upon both tumor and patient characteristics and tumor biology (see <a href=\"#H95431457\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients who have received little or no prior therapy, we suggest initial treatment with chemoimmunotherapy followed by observation rather than chemoimmunotherapy followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
