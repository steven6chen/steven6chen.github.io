Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. Other tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A X-ray or CT scan (a special type of X-ray) of the chest</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy &ndash; This is a test that involves taking a small sample of tissue. A doctor examines the sample in a lab. The tissue is usually taken from the skin or the kidney. Sometimes, the sample is taken from inside the nose or the lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7060120\"><span class=\"h1\">How is granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment happens in two parts, one after the other. It involves medicines that suppress the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system.&quot;</p><p>The first part of treatment is called &quot;induction.&quot; You will need to take strong medicines that are given as pills or into a vein through a small tube called an &quot;IV.&quot; You will need to see your doctor at least once a month during this part of treatment. That's because the medicines can have serious side effects. This part lasts until your symptoms get better, which usually takes about 6 months.</p><p>The second part of treatment is called &quot;maintenance.&quot; For this part, your doctor will switch you to a lower dose of the medicines you are taking. Or you might take different medicines that have less serious side effects. The maintenance part lasts at least one year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7060135\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-kidney-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Renal (kidney) biopsy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
