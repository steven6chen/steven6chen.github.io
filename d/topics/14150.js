Prenatal hydronephrosis is a condition that involves one or both of the baby's kidneys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65630 \">figure 1</a>). Kidneys work to make urine. Each kidney has 2 parts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A part that filters the blood and removes waste and excess salt and water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A part that collects the urine</p><p/><p>In hydronephrosis, the part of the kidney that collects the urine has too much urine in it. This causes it to swell and get bigger than normal.</p><p>Some babies have hydronephrosis that lasts only for a short time and then goes away. This condition is not serious and doesn't cause any long-term problems.</p><p>If the hydronephrosis doesn't go away, it could be caused by a serious problem in the urinary tract. For example, there might be a block in the urinary tract, or urine might flow backwards from the bladder to the kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2736749\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my baby has prenatal hydronephrosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors find out a baby has it when they do a routine imaging test, called an ultrasound, to check on the baby during pregnancy. An ultrasound creates pictures of the baby inside the uterus. Prenatal hydronephrosis does not cause any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2736756\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need more tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your baby has hydronephrosis, your doctor will want to see if it goes away or not, or gets worse. You will have one or more ultrasounds to follow up during your pregnancy.</p><p>When your doctor does an ultrasound, he or she will check:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If one or both kidneys have hydronephrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How severe the condition is</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your amniotic fluid &ndash; Amniotic fluid is the fluid in the uterus that surrounds the baby. It is made up of the baby's urine. If a problem keeps the kidneys from making enough urine, the amount of amniotic fluid will be low.</p><p/><p>If the follow-up ultrasound shows that the hydronephrosis has gone away, you probably won't need any more tests.</p><p>If the follow-up ultrasound shows that the hydronephrosis has not gone away or is worse, you will likely need more tests. These can include more ultrasounds or tests to look for other conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2736763\"><span class=\"h1\">How is prenatal hydronephrosis treated during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors follow the condition with tests, but they do not usually treat it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2736770\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hydronephrosis treated after birth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on the number of kidneys involved and how severe the condition was before birth.</p><p>If the hydronephrosis went away before birth, your baby will not need any tests or treatment after birth.</p><p>If the hydronephrosis did not go away, your baby will need tests after birth. He or she might also need treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the condition involved only one kidney or was mild, your baby will have an ultrasound after he or she is 1 week old. Depending on those results, he or she might need other tests. Your baby's doctor might also prescribe an antibiotic medicine. This medicine can help prevent your baby from getting a kidney infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the condition involved both kidneys or was severe, your baby will have an ultrasound within the first few days of life. Your baby's doctor will probably prescribe an antibiotic medicine. This medicine can help prevent your baby from getting a kidney infection. Your baby might also need other tests to check the urinary tract.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2736777\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniocentesis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Amniocentesis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chorionic villus sampling (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-infection-pyelonephritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
