Influenza occurs in outbreaks and epidemics worldwide, mainly during the winter season. Although acutely debilitating, influenza is usually a self-limited infection. However, it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in certain high-risk populations.</p><p>Two classes of antiviral drugs are available for the treatment and prevention of influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neuraminidase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peramivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peramivir</a>, which are active against both influenza A and B</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The adamantanes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rimantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rimantadine</a>, which are only active against influenza A. Due to a marked increase in resistant isolates, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adamantanes <strong>not</strong> be used in the United States for the treatment of influenza, except in selected circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2855203998\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antiviral drug'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The role of these drugs in the treatment of seasonal influenza will be reviewed here. Their role in the prevention of seasonal influenza, treatment and prevention of avian influenza, and treatment and prevention of influenza in children are discussed separately; the pharmacologic characteristics of the antiviral drugs used for influenza are also presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-seasonal-influenza-with-antiviral-drugs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of seasonal influenza with antiviral drugs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of avian influenza&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-and-treatment-with-antiviral-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention and treatment with antiviral drugs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avian-influenza-a-h7n9-treatment-and-prevention#H19143793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Avian influenza A H7N9: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Postexposure prophylaxis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-antiviral-drugs-for-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of antiviral drugs for influenza&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When initiated promptly, antiviral therapy with a neuraminidase inhibitor can shorten the duration of influenza symptoms by approximately one-half to three days; in most studies, the benefit has been greatest when given within the first 24 to 30 hours and in patients with fever at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]. Most trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> in ambulatory patients have been limited to patients presenting within 48 hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prevailing impression has been that there is little or no benefit when treatment is initiated two days or more after the onset of uncomplicated influenza. However, a patient survey found that only 13 percent of patients called their clinician within 48 hours of the onset of influenza-like symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study of outpatients at increased risk for influenza complications, only 30 percent presented for care within 48 hours of symptom onset and, among those who did, only 15 percent were prescribed an antiviral agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The proportion was higher among patients who presented early and who had laboratory-confirmed influenza (43 percent) or who presented during the peak week of influenza season (31 percent).</p><p>Some studies have suggested that antiviral therapy reduces the severity and incidence of complications of influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/8,11,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,15-18</a>], the length of stay in those hospitalized for influenza including older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], and influenza-associated mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. However, other studies of immunocompetent patients have not shown a reduction in complications of influenza among patients who received antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of antiviral agents for seasonal influenza are discussed in greater detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Neuraminidase inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adamantanes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2855203171\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIVIRAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) published updated comprehensive guidelines for the use of antivirals for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and a summary of antiviral recommendations was released subsequently by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In late December 2017, the CDC's Health Alert Network released a health advisory describing a significant increase in influenza activity, with influenza A H3N2 viruses predominating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Influenza should therefore be high on clinicians' lists of possible diagnoses for ill patients. H3N2 virus-predominant influenza seasons have typically been associated with more hospitalizations and deaths in those &ge;65 years of age and in young children. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) has been lower against H3N2 viruses than against influenza A H1N1 or influenza B viruses. During the 2016 to 2017 season in the United States, VE against circulating H3N2 viruses was estimated to be 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and, during the 2017 season in Australia, it was estimated to be only 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. For this reason, in addition to influenza vaccination for prevention of influenza, the use of antiviral medications for treatment of influenza is even more important than usual.</p><p>Our recommendations are similar to those of the ACIP and CDC. See the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/index.htm&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsfBp2DZg3BEIVONZ5Y4pJ+Is2R/Ky7MI6W5iLPfbmyM8njOomaggvj+BJ569Ep4slA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6998\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC website</a> for updated recommendations. Clinicians in other countries should consult with their ministries of health <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the World Health Organization for specific recommendations.</p><p>In 2014, the authors of some meta-analyses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a> questioned recommendations for the use of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, based upon all available data, including a 2015 meta-analysis that used individual patient data and demonstrated the benefit of oseltamivir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], we continue to recommend antiviral therapy with a neuraminidase inhibitor for patients with any of the indications for treatment discussed below. Our position is consistent with that of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the CDC; both groups have released statements addressing the concerns raised by authors of the meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2855203282\"><span class=\"h2\">Target populations for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with severe disease (requiring hospitalization or evidence of lower respiratory tract infection) or at high risk for complications should receive antiviral therapy.

If such individuals present within the first 48 hours of illness, antiviral treatment can be considered in order to reduce the duration of illness, but those who present &gt;48 hours after illness onset should <strong>not</strong> be treated with antivirals since they are unlikely to benefit.</p><p>Patients who are recovering from influenza generally do not require antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The decision of whether to initiate antiviral therapy for each patient should be based upon what is known about the potential benefits of therapy for seasonal influenza versus the potential risks. Given the concerning trends of increasing resistance with both the adamantanes and the neuraminidase inhibitors, the risk of promoting antiviral drug resistance should be considered when deciding which patients to treat. Overuse of the neuraminidase inhibitors, which are the agents of choice for the prevention and treatment of influenza, will promote further development of resistance that could lead to these agents becoming ineffective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2855203899\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of antiviral initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When indicated, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible since antiviral therapy is most likely to provide benefit when initiated within the first 48 hours of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/1,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36</a>]. Treatment should <strong>not</strong> be delayed while awaiting the results of diagnostic testing, nor should it be withheld in patients with indications for therapy who present &gt;48 hours after the onset of symptoms, particularly among patients requiring hospitalization. Furthermore, patients who have a negative rapid antigen test for influenza but in whom the clinical suspicion for influenza infection is high should be treated with antivirals since the sensitivity of these tests is generally low. Even with the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is more sensitive than the rapid antigen tests, false-negative results can occur due to improper or poor clinical specimen collection or from poor handling of a specimen after collection and before testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For hospitalized patients, especially for patients with lower respiratory tract disease, if no other etiology is identified and influenza is still suspected, additional specimens should be tested, and antiviral treatment should be initiated or continued.

Severely ill patients who cannot receive oseltamivir (eg, those who cannot tolerate enteral agents) should receive intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peramivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peramivir</a>. Although the US Food and Drug Administration has only approved IV peramivir for patients with uncomplicated influenza, we think it is also reasonable to use it for patients with severe influenza who cannot receive oral oseltamivir; in such patients, we would use either oseltamivir by a nasogastric tube or IV peramivir.</p><p>The adamantanes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rimantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rimantadine</a>, are active only against influenza A viruses, but high rates of resistance have developed among influenza A viruses, and these drugs are infrequently indicated.

The recommended dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peramivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peramivir</a> is 600 mg IV as a single dose.

However, there is no evidence that doubling the dose of either oseltamivir or IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a> (an investigational agent) is more effective than the usual dose in hospitalized patients with or without severe illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. We therefore do not give a double dose of oseltamivir for seasonal influenza.</p><p>In a randomized trial of hospitalized patients with severe influenza, mortality was similar in patients who received double-dose or standard-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> (7.3 versus 5.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. No differences were observed for clearance of virus by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on day 5 of treatment or median days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation. In a prospective study of adults hospitalized with influenza between 2010 and 2012 in Hong Kong who were treated with a single or double dose of oseltamivir twice daily, there were no differences between groups in day 5 influenza RNA or culture negativity, RNA decline rate, or duration of fever, oxygen supplementation, or hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

One reason for this is that some trials evaluated patients with influenza-like illness, whereas others limited their analysis to those with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Including all patients with influenza-like illness leads to an underestimate of benefit since oseltamivir does not have activity against viruses other than influenza. As an example, a 2011 meta-analysis that analyzed the results from 11 randomized trials concluded that oseltamivir treatment reduced the risk of lower respiratory tract complications by 28 percent overall (95% CI 11-42 percent) and by 37 percent among patients with confirmed influenza infections (95% CI 18-52 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A 2015 meta-analysis evaluated all published and unpublished randomized trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> for the treatment of influenza in adults that were sponsored by the manufacturer of oseltamivir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This meta-analysis was funded by the manufacturer of oseltamivir but was performed by an independent research group. Individual patient data from nine trials of 4328 adults were included. In the intention-to-treat population of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, there was a significant reduction in time to alleviation of all symptoms for oseltamivir compared with placebo (time ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.85; median times to alleviation of symptoms 97.5 versus 122.7 hours). Oseltamivir conferred no benefit in patients without confirmed influenza infection. In the intention-to-treat influenza infected population, among those who were assigned to oseltamivir, there were fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 hours after randomization (risk ratio [RR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.75; 4.9 versus 8.7 percent) and fewer hospital admissions for any cause (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.81; 0.6 versus 1.7 percent). It should be noted that the difference in hospital admissions was modest (a 1.1 percent reduction in those assigned to oseltamivir versus placebo).</p><p>Another group has published a series of meta-analyses since 2009 questioning the benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>. In 2014, this group published a meta-analysis of unpublished clinical study reports from 15 randomized trials of treatment with oseltamivir (11 in adults, 4 in children) obtained from the European Medicines Agency and the manufacturer of oseltamivir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this meta-analysis, treatment with oseltamivir reduced the duration of symptoms by 16.8 hours in immunocompetent adults and children with influenza-like illness. There was no difference in hospital admissions in adults who received oseltamivir and those who received placebo. When studies were included in which the diagnosis of pneumonia could not be verified by the meta-analysts, oseltamivir appeared to reduce the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.90; risk difference 1 percent; 95% CI 0.22-1.49 percent). However, the effect was not statistically significant in the five trials that used a more detailed diagnosis form for pneumonia. No trials reported laboratory or diagnostic confirmation of pneumonia. There was no significant reduction in the risk of unverified bronchitis, otitis media, sinusitis, or any complication classified as serious or that led to study withdrawal. The authors noted that the evidence of clinically significant effects on complications was limited because these events were rare and because of problems with study design.</p><p>The methodologies of the 2014 and 2015 meta-analyses differed in that the former used aggregate study results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], while the latter used individual patient data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Individuals with severe disease (requiring hospitalization or evidence of lower respiratory tract infection) or at high risk for complications should receive antiviral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2855203282\" class=\"local\">'Target populations for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When indicated, antiviral therapy should be initiated as soon as possible since antiviral therapy is most likely to provide benefit when initiated within the first 48 hours of illness. Treatment should <strong>not</strong> be delayed while awaiting the results of diagnostic testing, nor should it be withheld in patients with indications for therapy who present &gt;48 hours after the onset of symptoms, particularly among patients requiring hospitalization. Furthermore, patients who have a negative rapid antigen test for influenza but in whom the clinical suspicion for influenza infection is high should be treated with antivirals since the sensitivity of these tests may be low. (See <a href=\"#H2855203899\" class=\"local\">'Timing of antiviral initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antiviral therapy (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>) for all individuals with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection who are severely ill, such as those with lower respiratory tract infection (eg, dyspnea, tachypnea, unexplained oxygen desaturation), and those who are showing signs of rapid clinical deterioration; we recommend treatment for such patients whether they present early in the course of infection (&lt;48 hours after symptom onset) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) or later (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).

There is high quality evidence for benefit to the individual patient; however, there is only low quality evidence regarding the magnitude of the risk of promoting resistance, which remains a major concern.
