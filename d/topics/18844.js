This injury usually happens from car accidents or sports injuries, or when a baby is shaken too hard.</p><p>A whiplash injury can damage different parts of the neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72120\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72120 \">figure 1</a>), such as the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligaments &ndash; Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that connect bones to other bones.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bones &ndash; The neck has 7 bones (called &quot;vertebrae&quot;) that are stacked on top of each other.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discs &ndash; Discs are cushions that sit between the bones.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerves &ndash; A bundle of nerves (called the spinal cord) travels down the middle of the spine. Nerves branch off from the spinal cord to all parts of the body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscles &ndash; Muscles hold the head up and make the neck move.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11943811\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of whiplash?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle tightness or spasm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being unable to move your neck or turn your head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A headache, especially in the back of the head</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11943826\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with whiplash do <strong>not</strong> need to seek medical help. In most people, symptoms go away without treatment. Still, you should see a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms are getting worse and are so severe that you cannot do normal activities (such as dress or eat).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms don't improve after you treat them at home for a few weeks.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have numbness or weakness in your arms or legs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11943841\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have whiplash by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>Some people with whiplash will need tests. Depending on your symptoms and how long they have lasted, your doctor might do an X-ray, MRI scan, or CT scan. These are imaging tests that can create pictures of the inside of your body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11943856\"><span class=\"h1\">How is whiplash treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whiplash usually gets better on its own within 2 to 3 weeks. But some people have symptoms for longer.</p><p>To help with your pain and symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine &ndash; You can use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or a &quot;nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug&quot; (NSAID). NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practice good posture &ndash; Don't carry bags by wearing their shoulder straps on your shoulder. Also, avoid sitting for too many hours at a time. When you do sit, sit up straight and keep your shoulders back. When you sleep, keep your head and neck in line with your body. You might have less pain if you sleep on your back with pillows under your thighs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do neck stretches and exercises &ndash; Your doctor will show you which stretches and exercises to do, and tell you how often to do them.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11943871\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my symptoms are severe or don't get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms are severe or don't get better, your doctor might recommend:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Your doctor can prescribe strong pain medicines. He or she can also prescribe medicines to relax your muscles (called &quot;muscle relaxants&quot;) for when you sleep.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy (working with an exercise expert)</p><p/><p>If these treatments don't help, your doctor will talk with you about other possible treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11943886\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments are not helpful?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most doctors do not recommend that people wear soft neck collars, especially for long periods of time. If a neck collar eases your pain, wear it for less than 3 hours at a time. Wearing a neck collar for too long can make your neck muscles get too weak.</p><p>Other treatments that are <strong>not</strong> helpful include surgery or a treatment that pulls on the head to lengthen the neck (called &quot;cervical traction&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11943901\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
