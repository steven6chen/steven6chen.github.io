Patients with HFpEF are characterized by chronic elevation of left atrial and pulmonary venous pressure. The pulmonary artery pressure increases in proportion to the elevated pulmonary venous pressure (passive elevation; post-capillary PH). If the pressure remains elevated, over time the small pulmonary arteries and arterioles can remodel resulting in an occlusive vasculopathy similar to that seen in patients with WHO group 1 PAH (post-capillary and pre-capillary PH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105764 \">table 2</a>)). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with obesity can also develop an extreme form of diastolic dysfunction sometimes referred to as an &quot;obesity-associated restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. It is characterized by fatty infiltration of cardiac myocytes, restrictive physiology, and marked elevation in left and right heart filling pressures. These patients can also progress to severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to an occlusive vasculopathy of the small pulmonary arteries and arterioles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> &ndash; Multiple factors contribute to LHD-PH, including chronic pulmonary venous congestion, recurrent transient hypoxemia, and sleep-disordered breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. PH initially develops in those with left atrial hypertension due to a proportional increase in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (post-capillary PH) that is required to maintain an adequate driving force across the pulmonary vasculature. Ultimately, the magnitude of PH that results from any given level of left atrial hypertension varies greatly due to individual differences in the vasoconstrictive and vascular remodeling responses such that patients may have elements of both post-capillary and pre-capillary PH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105764 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> &ndash; The true prevalence of LHD-PH is unknown. Estimates have been hampered by inaccurate methodology in measurement and by heterogeneity in the study populations, such that reported rates range from 25 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction can develop PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The exact incidence varies with the population studied. As an example, in a study of 108 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 26 percent had an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) above 40 mmHg, measured by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

PH is, in general, an uncommon manifestation of these disorders. Among them, SCD is the best studied. The most frequent cause of PH in SCD is left-sided heart disease but some patients also have disease that mimics group 1 PAH and group 4 PH, highlighting the multifactorial nature of PH in this group.

National surveillance data reported that mortality rates from PH have increased from 5.2 to 5.4 per 100,000 over a 22 year period (1980 to 2002), with the greatest increase reported in African-Americans and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Mortality rates were reported as 7.3 per 100,000 in African-Americans, 5.3 per 100,000 in Caucasians, 5.5 per 100,000 in women and 5.4 per 100,000 in men. These data may reflect increased physician awareness and changes in diagnosing and reporting PH over the time period of the study. In the same study, the most common cause of death was chronic lower respiratory disease from 1980 until 1999. Although PH itself was the most common cause of death after 1999, the experience of the authors is that reasons for death in this population are highly variable. </p><p>The prognosis of PH is highly variable and depends upon the etiology and severity of PH. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Etiology of PH &ndash; In general, in the absence of therapy, those with group 1 PAH have worse survival than groups 2 through 5. However, with therapy, patients with chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH; group 4), particularly surgically correctable CTEPH tend to have the best survival. As an example, in the Giessen Pulmonary Hypertension Registry, patients with CTEPH had the best one- three- and five-year survival rates of 89, 77, and 67 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Compared with those who had PAH, those with chronic lung disease associated PH (group 3) had worse survival at one year (80 versus 88 percent), three years (52 versus 72 percent), and five years (38 versus 59 percent). Patients with group 2 PH had similar survival rates to those with PAH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of PH &ndash; In general, severe PH (eg, mean pulmonary arterial pressure &ge;35 mmHg), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/</span> or evidence of right heart failure have a poor prognosis. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H887226\"><span class=\"h2\">Group 1 PAH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history and prognosis of group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is better studied than that of groups 2 through 5. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67997355\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis without therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Without therapy, the prognosis of patients in group 1 PAH is poor. Data from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL registry) reported that, from the time of diagnostic right heart catheterization, patients with PAH had one-year survival rate of 85 percent, three-year survival of 68 percent, five-year survival of 57 percent, and seven-year survival rate of 49 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The one-year survival of patients with newly diagnosed group 1 PAH may be predicted using a risk score derived from REVEAL registry data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The risk score is the sum of points derived from clinical data including group 1 subgroup, demographics, and comorbidities; functional class, vital signs, six-minute walk test, and brain natriuretic peptide level; echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, and right heart catheterization findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F85543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85543 \">figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-reveal-pah-score-and-estimated-one-year-survival-for-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).

One-year survival correlated with risk score: 1 to 7 (95 percent), 8 (92 percent), 9 (89 percent), 10 to 11 (72 percent), and &ge;12 (66 percent). This risk score calculates survival only and should not be used to make decisions for treatment. This and other models (eg, The French Pulmonary Hypertension Network [FPHN] registry) require prospective validation before they can be routinely used in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Prognosis was reported using data derived from the COMPERA (Comparative, Prospective Registry of Newly Initiated Therapies for Pulmonary hypertension) database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients were risk stratified using a model that incorporated World Health Organization functional class, six minute walk distance, brain natriuretic peptide levels, right atrial pressure, cardiac index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) refers to group 1 PH, while PH refers to any of group 2 PH through group 5 PH. PH is also used to refer to all five groups collectively. Pre-capillary PH is due to a primary elevation of pressure in the pulmonary arterial system alone (eg, PAH) while post-capillary PH is that due to elevations of pressure in the pulmonary venous and pulmonary capillary systems (pulmonary venous hypertension; eg, group 2 PH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105764 \">table 2</a>).
