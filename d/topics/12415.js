Declines have been greatest among children who were born after 1991 when recommendations for universal hepatitis B vaccination of infants were implemented. By 2007, the incidence of acute hepatitis B in children &lt;15 years had fallen to 0.02 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

This is important because about 5 percent of such infants develop chronic HBV infection even after optimal immunoprophylaxis. Those infants who were not immunized should be tested as soon as identified. Infants born to mothers who were not tested for HBsAg during pregnancy should also receive hepatitis B vaccine before hospital discharge (as is recommended for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers), and the maternal HBsAg status should be determined as soon as possible.

Universal HBV vaccination has substantially reduced the frequency of fulminant hepatitis. As an example, mortality in Taiwan decreased from 5.36 to 1.71 per 100,000 during the last two decades of the 20th century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations in children who develop symptoms are similar to those in adults. The incubation period lasts one to four months. A serum sickness-like syndrome may develop during the prodromal period, followed by constitutional symptoms, anorexia, nausea, jaundice and right-upper-quadrant discomfort. The symptoms and jaundice generally disappear after one to three months, but some patients have prolonged fatigue even after normalization of serum aminotransferase concentrations.

Some children note vague right upper quadrant discomfort and fatigue.</p><p>Chronic HBV infection is occasionally associated with extrahepatic manifestations including polyarteritis nodosa and glomerulonephropathy; the latter is observed principally in children. HBV infection can induce both membranous nephropathy and, less often, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The typical presentation is with nephrotic range proteinuria. Approximately 30 to 60 percent of children with HBV-related membranous nephropathy undergo spontaneous remission, usually in association with HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion (ie, conversion from HBeAg positive to negative, and from anti-HBe negative to positive). The incidence of HBV associated membranous nephropathy is falling as rates of HBV vaccination increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The exact mechanisms through which immune tolerance develops are unknown.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children from endemic countries in whom HBV was acquired perinatally usually remain HBeAg-positive and have high levels of viral replication, although histologic injury is typically mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In an illustrative report from Taiwan, which followed a cohort of children with HBV infection born before the implementation of universal HBV immunization, approximately 66 percent of children remained HBeAg positive at 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Rates of spontaneous seroconversion are less than 2 percent per year in children younger than three years of age, and 4 to 5 percent after age three. The frequency of spontaneous seroconversion increases during puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In boys, the rate of seroconversion is associated with testosterone levels and earlier onset of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, children in non-endemic countries are less likely to have acquired the disease perinatally. In this case, they frequently clear HBeAg and HBV DNA from serum during the first two decades of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a 29-year longitudinal study of Italian children with chronic HBV who underwent HBeAg seroconversion, 95 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(81/85)</span> of those without cirrhosis had inactive HBV infection at most recent follow-up, and 15 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(13/89)</span> cleared HBsAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Children who seroconvert spontaneously tend to have higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels early in life as compared with those who do not seroconvert spontaneously.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Phases of chronic HBV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with perinatally acquired chronic HBV infection typically enter an immune tolerant phase, from which they eventually move on to an immune active phase and thence to spontaneous clearance of the infection or to an inactive chronic HBV state. The timing of this progression varies between individuals, and the severity of liver injury may depend on the length of the immune active phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64996%7EGAST%2F76907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64996 graphicRef76907 \">figure 2A-B</a>). Some patients may progress rapidly through one or more of these phases, so each step may not be clinically apparent.

HBsAg and HBeAg are positive. Young children with vertically transmitted disease typically enter this phase, which continues for months, years, or even decades before entering the immune-active phase. Treatment of patients in this phase is not recommended because patients are unlikely to respond, and treatment with nucleoside or nucleotide analogs may induce drug resistance and even cross-resistance to newer medications.

HBsAg and HBeAg are positive. Patients in this phase are more likely to clear HBeAg spontaneously or to respond to treatment than those in the immune tolerant phase. Spontaneous clearance of HBeAg early in life is less likely for patients with genotype C as compared with other genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There is increasing evidence that individuals with prolonged immune active phase of HBV are at high risk for progressive liver disease, prompting a more proactive approach to treatment of children in this phase.

HBsAg is positive but HBeAg is negative. Up to 20 percent of patients have one or more reversions to the immune active phase, and 20 to 30 percent reactivate into HBeAg-negative HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These conversions may occur at any time, so regular monitoring is necessary. These patients also remain at risk for complications of HBV such as hepatocellular carcinoma.

Viral DNA levels increase, and ALT is normal or elevated, but HBeAg remains undetectable. Patients in this phase tend to have more virulent liver disease. Antiviral therapy (interferon, or sometimes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">entecavir</a> or tenofovir) may be indicated to minimize liver damage, although long-term clearance of HBV is rare.

One of the largest studies included 292 consecutive children who were HBsAg positive and had elevated serum ALT levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Cirrhosis was found in 10 patients (3 percent) at a mean age 4.0 &plusmn;3.3 years. However, children with cirrhosis had a higher prevalence of Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection and were more likely to have had blood transfusions suggesting that coinfection with HDV or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) may have contributed to disease progression in some children. No child developed cirrhosis during follow-up (ranging from 1 to 10 years).</p><p>Although frank cirrhosis is unusual during childhood, development of moderate or severe fibrosis is relatively common. In a series of 76 children with chronic HBe-Ag-positive HBV and elevated ALT, at least half had moderate to severe fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These findings suggest that many individuals with perinatally acquired chronic HBV are at risk for developing cirrhosis in the long term.

The risk is higher among individuals from areas endemic for HBV infection, most of whom acquire the disease perinatally, and individuals who abuse alcohol probably have accelerated disease progression. Males also have higher risk for exacerbations of HBV, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma as compared to females (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Sequelae and prognosis of chronic HBV infection'</a>). In transgenic mice, hepatitis B virus acts as a sex hormone responsive virus, which may explain the lower rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and HBV viral load seen in women compared with men; human correlation is awaited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatocellular carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in children and adults with HBV infection has been described in both Asian and Western populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>].

The risk is related to the duration of disease, the degree of histologic injury, and the replicative state of the virus (HBV DNA levels). The risk is higher in patients who are HBeAg positive for extended periods of time and for those with precore mutants. The risk is increased further in the presence of cirrhosis or concomitant infection with HCV or HIV. However, HCC has been described in children who had undergone early HBeAg seroconversion, indicating that there is still a risk for HCC even after viral replication ceases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

However, we generally monitor liver ultrasound and serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) every 12 months. For patients with elevated AFP, cirrhosis, or a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, we monitor more closely. Because the risk for HCC increases with age, it is reasonable to screen somewhat less frequently (eg, every two to three years) in young patients in the immune tolerant phase, if baseline AFP and ultrasound are normal.</p><p>HCC can develop in patients with HBV infection, regardless of whether the virus is actively replicating. Therefore, we continue surveillance for HCC in individuals in all phases of HBV infection, including those who have undergone seroconversion (converted to HBeAg negative), either spontaneously or after successful treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of patients for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few large trials in children to guide treatment decisions for chronic HBV. To date, the efficacy of treatment has only been measured through intermediate outcomes such as changes in short-term virologic, biochemical, and histologic parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The ultimate goal of treatment is to reduce the risks of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Effects of treatment on these long-term outcomes are inferred from the intermediate virologic and biochemical outcomes of treatment trials, but are not clinically proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Because progression to cirrhosis appears to be associated with the intensity and duration of chronic inflammatory activity, it is reasonable to infer that successful treatment of HBV probably reduces the risk of cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It is not clear whether treatment reduces the risk for HCC. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Hepatocellular carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p>None of the available treatments is highly efficacious. Furthermore, under some circumstances, prolonged treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamivudine</a> or other nucleoside or nucleotide analogs induces drug resistance in a substantial percentage of patients. Therefore, the choice of whether and when to treat depends on several patient-specific characteristics which predict the efficacy of treatment, including persistently abnormal ALT levels, and active disease shown on liver biopsy (if performed), as well as on the patient's values and preferences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78464\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78464 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Trials in adults and children demonstrate that the likelihood of response to any of the currently available drugs depends highly upon the degree of elevation of the serum aminotransferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,46,47</a>]. This observation leads to several general recommendations about treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment for most patients with HBV DNA-positive chronic hepatitis who are in the immune active phase (usually defined as persistently abnormal ALT and HBV DNA &gt;20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span> or 10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> for at least four to six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Almost all children with chronic HBV are HBeAg positive, but therapy can also be considered for the few in whom HBeAg is negative provided that active HBV infection is documented by demonstration of viremia of &gt;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> and ALT is persistently abnormal. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>NOT</strong> treating patients with ALT levels less than 1.5 to 2 times the upper limit of normal, even if HBV DNA levels are high. These findings generally indicate that the patient is in the immune tolerant phase of HBV infection, and in this phase treatment with any of the currently available drugs does not result in higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion compared with no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,47,48</a>]. Moreover, treatment of patients in this phase using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamivudine</a> or other nucleoside or nucleotide analogs is associated with development of drug resistance, which could diminish responsiveness to the same or related medications at a later date, when hepatic injury is active. In exceptional clinical situations, a child with normal ALT levels may be considered for treatment. In adults, treatment is generally recommended for patients with cirrhosis and elevated HBV levels, regardless of the serum ALT level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Instead, these patients should be observed for several months with serial serologic testing. Treatment should then be initiated if the patient has not undergone seroconversion to the inactive chronic HBV state (ie, converted from HBeAg+ to HBeAg-, with undetectable HBV DNA). In this state, HBeAb is usually positive but should be monitored periodically because some individuals have a mutant HBV which is associated with active liver disease despite low levels of HBeAg (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Hepatitis B e antigen and antibody'</a>). If there is evidence of hepatic decompensation, such as jaundice or coagulopathy, treatment should be initiated earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Interferon cannot be used in patients with decompensated disease.</p><p/><p>Several other considerations may be relevant to treatment decisions for individual patients, such as those co-infected with HCV, HIV or HDV. A limited course of treatment may also be appropriate in some children who will be undergoing immunosuppression (such as chemotherapy, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha treatments, or organ transplantation), even if they are in the immune tolerant or inactive chronic HBV phase of HBV infection. In this case, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamivudine</a> or another nucleos(t)ide is often used in an effort to prevent reactivation; these drugs may be discontinued after immune reconstitution and if HBV DNA remains undetectable.

Thus, IFN is a good choice for the patients who are most likely to respond, ie, for patients with serum ALT more than twice the upper limit of normal, have positive HBeAg, who are committed to adhering to the treatment, and have no comorbid diseases that might be exacerbated by an immunostimulatory agent. IFN is not associated with the development of resistant variants.

It is also appropriate for those who do not respond to IFN (defined by detectable HBV DNA and elevated serum ALT six months after completion of the course of IFN alfa) or for those who have a contraindication to IFN, such as an underlying autoimmune disorder, organ transplant, or serious neuropsychiatric disease.

(See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p>For children with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection we typically treat with a six month course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-alfa-2b-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">interferon alfa-2b</a>, six million units (MU) per m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (maximum 10 MU) three times a week for 24 weeks, followed by an observation period of 6 to 12 months.

Outside of the context of a clinical trial, pegylated interferon should be used with caution in young children with HBV if at all, because its efficacy has not been established in this age group, and because of potential side effects, which include growth suppression in prepubertal children. Although pegylated interferon not yet licensed for HBV in patients younger than 18 years, it may be acceptable as therapy for post-pubertal children with active hepatic disease, but should be avoided if cirrhosis is present.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hepatitis B is made by serologic testing for HBsAg and anti-HBc. The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, and the presence of IgG anti-HBc (with negative anti-HBc IgM) indicates that the infection is chronic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76907 \">figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60627 \">table 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with serologic evidence of HBV should be further evaluated with aminotransferases, HBV DNA, and HBeAg. Other causes of liver disease should be excluded. Patients should be vaccinated against hepatitis A if not already immune. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Counseling and prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Only carefully selected patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated during childhood</strong>. This is because none of the available treatments is highly efficacious. Furthermore, under some circumstances, treatment is associated with a high likelihood of drug resistance. Therefore, the choice of whether to treat depends on several patient-specific characteristics which predict the efficacy of treatment, including persistently abnormal ALT levels, and active disease shown on liver biopsy (if performed), as well as on the patient's values and preferences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78464\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78464 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that patients who are in the <strong>immune tolerant</strong> or <strong>inactive</strong> phases of chronic hepatitis B <strong>NOT</strong> be treated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>); this is defined as HBsAg positive and persistently normal <span class=\"nowrap\">ALT/AST</span> levels, HBeAg positive or negative, even if the HBV DNA levels are high. Instead, they should undergo monitoring of liver biochemical tests every 6 to 12 months to look for evidence of immune activation or reactivation after HBeAg seroconversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64996 \">figure 2A</a>).

Most children with this profile will be HBeAg positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64996 \">figure 2A</a>). Children with lower ALT levels are unlikely to respond to treatment. Those with markedly elevated ALT levels (greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) and low HBV DNA levels may be in the process of spontaneous seroconversion, and thus should be observed for several months before considering treatment. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients for treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a decision to treat has been made, either interferon alfa (IFN alpha) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">entecavir</a> are appropriate first-line choices for most patients. The decision among these agents depends on the characteristics and preferences of the individual patient. Entecavir is an orally administered agent with moderate efficacy against HBV and is now licensed in the United States for children two years of age and older. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Choice of treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Interferon alfa'</a> above and <a href=\"#H558598252\" class=\"local\">'Entecavir'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newer agents that may be appropriate for selected children with HBV include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pegylated interferon alfa &ndash; The efficacy of pegylated interferons in children with chronic HBV infection has not been established. Based on its efficacy in adults and experience in using it for treatment of HCV in children, we feel that it is a reasonable choice for children with HBV who are in the immune active phase of HBV infection, in the context of a clinical trial. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Pegylated interferon'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (DF) &ndash; Licensed in the United States for adolescents 12 years and older, after demonstrating excellent viral suppression and a good safety profile in two years of use.

However, data regarding HBeAg seroconversion are lacking, and the optimal duration of therapy has not been defined.
