Patients should initially be treated with a synchronized (if possible) 120 to 200 joule shock from a biphasic defibrillator or a 360 joule shock from a monophasic defibrillator; if synchronization is not possible, then an unsynchronized countershock should be delivered, typically at higher energy doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias-approach-to-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

If the initial diagnosis of WCT was made from a single-lead rhythm strip, a full 12-lead ECG should be obtained during the WCT and methodically reviewed as this may provide additional clues to the etiology. In addition, a trial of vagal maneuvers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharmacologic intervention can provide both diagnostic information and, on occasion, prove therapeutic if there is resolution of the WCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of the electrocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p>For hemodynamically stable patients with WCT which is regular and monomorphic in whom the etiology of the WCT remains uncertain, we suggest the following approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62714\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62714 \">algorithm 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform vagal maneuvers (Valsalva, carotid sinus massage, etc) &ndash; Introducing transient block at the AV node can serve as a <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnostic/therapeutic</span> challenge. Most supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) are AV node dependent (eg, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia [AVRT]), so transient AV nodal block will terminate most SVTs. Atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia may be &quot;unmasked&quot; by transient AVN block. Vagal maneuvers should have no significant effect on VT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vagal maneuvers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer adenosine &ndash; Intravenous adenosine has essentially the same effect as vagal maneuvers on SVT and atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">flutter/tachycardia</span>. Some idiopathic VTs (eg, right ventricular outflow tract [RVOT] VT) may terminate with adenosine. Resuscitation equipment should be immediately available as rarely adenosine will precipitate hemodynamic collapse. The initial dose of adenosine is 6 mg; if this has no effect, 12 mg can be administered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of other pharmacologic agents &ndash; Intravenous beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> are not typically used, due to the potential for hemodynamic deterioration (often the result of hypotension) in patients with a previously stable WCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further treatment is directed by the response to vagal maneuvers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adenosine, specifically targeting VT or the relevant SVT. If the WCT persists and the etiology remains uncertain, we proceed as though the WCT is VT and treat accordingly. (See <a href=\"#H172943340\" class=\"local\">'Stable patients with known WCT etiology'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>While any ECG analysis and <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnostic/therapeutic</span> maneuvers are being performed, close observation and continuous ECG monitoring are paramount, as patients with WCT who appear stable initially may experience a rapid deterioration of their clinical status with little or no warning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172942951\"><span class=\"h4\">Vagal maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with WCT of uncertain etiology, the response to vagal maneuvers may provide insight to the mechanism responsible for the arrhythmia. We perform one or more vagal maneuvers in all patients with WCT who are hemodynamically stable, often while preparing for pharmaceutical therapy or cardioversion. However, these interventions are associated with some risk, primarily the potential for hemodynamic deterioration in a borderline unstable patient, and as such should only be performed by experienced individuals in an environment capable of dealing with potential sequelae.</p><p>Vagal maneuvers increase parasympathetic input to the heart, which slows the rate of sinus node impulse formation and slows AV node conduction velocity while simultaneously lengthening the refractory period. The Valsalva maneuver and carotid sinus massage, two of the most commonly performed vagal maneuvers which enhance vagal tone and therefore depresses sinus and AV nodal activity, can be easily and quickly done at the bedside. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vagal maneuvers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examples of how various arrhythmias respond to vagal stimulation include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H684777\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Possible outcomes following vagal maneuvers or adenosine administration'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus tachycardia will gradually slow during the maneuver and then accelerate upon completion of the maneuver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter, the ventricular response will transiently slow (due to increased AV nodal blockade). The arrhythmia itself, which occurs within the atria, is usually unaffected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A paroxysmal SVT (either atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia [AVNRT] or AVRT) will frequently terminate because of the dependence on the AV node.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VT is generally unaffected by vagal maneuvers, although these maneuvers may slow or block retrograde conduction. In some cases, this response exposes AV dissociation by altering the sinus rate (or PP intervals). Rarely, VT terminates in response to carotid sinus pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172942963\"><span class=\"h4\">Pharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with WCT of uncertain etiology, the response to the administration of certain drugs can provide diagnostic information, which in certain circumstances may also provide a therapeutic benefit (eg, adenosine which may terminate some SVTs). However, some drugs used for the diagnosis or treatment of SVT (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, adenosine, or beta blockers) can cause severe hemodynamic deterioration (often the result of hypotension) in patients with a previously stable VT, potentially resulting in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias-approach-to-management/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Thus, other than adenosine, these medications are generally reserved for the treatment of patients in whom the diagnosis of SVT is already known; they are rarely used for diagnostic purposes for a WCT. (See <a href=\"#H528288449\" class=\"local\">'Supraventricular tachycardia'</a> below.)</p><p>Adenosine slows conduction time through the AV node. Arrhythmias that are dependent upon the AV node (eg, AVNRT, AVRT) will frequently be terminated following adenosine administration. Adenosine will usually not terminate other non-AV node dependent arrhythmias; a subgroup of atrial tachycardias may be adenosine sensitive. In addition, some idiopathic VTs (specifically RV outflow tract VT) may terminate with adenosine. If the tachycardia does not terminate, the ventricular response following adenosine administration is often helpful in distinguishing the etiology of the WCT. Not infrequently, adenosine will promote the conversion of SVT to atrial fibrillation (AF). If the patient has underlying Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, this may lead to extremely rapid ventricular rates, and potentially deterioration to VF. Thus, an external defibrillator should always be available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H684777\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Possible outcomes following vagal maneuvers or adenosine administration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is no change in the ventricular rate and rhythm, the WCT is likely VT. One exception would be if the adenosine was not properly administered (ie, rapid intravenous push followed by saline flush) and, because of its short half-life and metabolism by red blood cells, did not reach the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the ventricular activity temporarily slows or ceases (for 5 to 10 seconds), the remaining atrial activity is typically easily seen on the ECG and can be analyzed to determine the etiology of WCT. A second dose of 12 mg of adenosine, although appropriate for the treatment of known SVT, is probably not appropriate for WCT that is not known to be SVT.</p><p/><p>Adenosine is administered via rapid intravenous push, followed immediately by 10 mL saline flush. Common side effects include facial flushing, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, and lightheadedness.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VT should be suspected in patients with clearly identified AV dissociation, patients with QRS concordance and a right superior axis (or axis shift of greater than 40 degrees from baseline), and in patients with known structural heart disease. VT is typically regular, though slight variation of the RR interval may be seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SVT should be suspected in young patients with structurally normal hearts in whom none of the historical (eg, family history of sudden cardiac death), physical, or ECG criteria supporting VT are present, or in patients with a history of SVT with a similar presentation. The RR interval in SVT is generally very regular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant irregularity in a WCT is most often seen in patients with AF and aberrant conduction, though polymorphic VT is also irregular. Patients with AF should have similar QRS morphologies for every beat, while the QRS morphology varies in polymorphic VT. An important exception is pre-excited AF in patients with WPW syndrome, in which the QRS morphology is variable in width and morphology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome#H8472027\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528288375\"><span class=\"h4\">Ventricular tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the WCT has been established as VT, therapy should be promptly provided. Patients with VT who are hemodynamically stable may remain stable or may become unstable rapidly and without warning. The choice of initial treatments for hemodynamically stable VT includes electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion. Some of our experts proceed directly to electrical cardioversion, while others prefer to begin with an intravenous antiarrhythmic agent and reserve cardioversion for refractory patients or for those who become unstable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If electrical cardioversion with appropriate procedural sedation is the chosen approach, intravenous analgesics or sedatives should be cautiously administered if the blood pressure will tolerate their use. If the QRS complex and T wave can be distinguished, an attempt at emergent synchronized cardioversion can be performed with a synchronized shock of 100 joules using either a biphasic or monophasic defibrillator. If the QRS complex and T wave cannot be distinguished accurately, and a synchronized shock is not possible, we administer an unsynchronized 120 to 200 joule shock from a biphasic defibrillator or a 360 joule shock from a monophasic defibrillator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If pharmacologic cardioversion is the chosen approach, we administer intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> (150 mg IV over 10 minutes, followed by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute</span> for the next six hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> (20 to 50 mg per minute until arrhythmia terminates or a maximum dose of 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is administered). Often administration of these drugs may result in hypotension, which may hasten the need for electrical cardioversion. (See <a href=\"#H528288519\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent or refractory WCT'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any associated conditions should be treated, including cardiac ischemia, heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or drug toxicities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with one of the known syndromes of VT in structurally normal hearts, calcium channel blockers or beta blockers may be used, particularly if the patient has been successfully treated in the past with such medications. These drugs can be used either to terminate the arrhythmia, or after cardioversion to suppress recurrences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Given the risk for hemodynamic deterioration at any time, an external defibrillator should be immediately available at all times prior to and during the administration of any antiarrhythmic drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528288449\"><span class=\"h4\">Supraventricular tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the WCT has been definitively established as SVT, therapy directed at the SVT may be given. In such cases, management is similar to an SVT with a normal QRS duration. The ECG recording when the tachycardia slows or terminates can provide valuable information for diagnosing the specific type of SVT. Thus, in a stable patient, a continuous rhythm strip, preferably a 12-lead rhythm strip, should be recorded during any intervention intended to terminate the arrhythmia or slow the ventricular response.</p><p>For patients with known SVT, we suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the SVT is likely to be AVNRT or AVRT, or if the specific SVT diagnosis is uncertain, the following treatments are recommended:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vagal maneuvers &ndash; We recommend Valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus pressure (if no carotid bruits are present) as the initial intervention, given the ease with which this can be rapidly performed at the bedside. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adenosine &ndash; For patients with persistent SVT following vagal maneuvers, adenosine is highly effective in terminating many SVTs (eg, AVNRT, AVRT), and for others (eg, AF, atrial flutter), adenosine may facilitate the diagnosis by slowing the ventricular response to allow clearer assessment of atrial activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias-approach-to-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The usual initial dose is 6 mg, which can be followed by a maximal single dose of 12 mg if not successful. The drug is administered by rapid intravenous injection over one to two seconds at a peripheral site, followed by a normal saline flush, most easily accomplished through a three-way stopcock. Repeated dosing beyond the 12 mg bolus is not usually effective. If a central intravenous access site is used, the initial dose should not exceed 3 mg and may be as little as 1 mg. Not infrequently, adenosine will promote the conversion of SVT to AF. If the patient has underlying WPW syndrome, this may lead to extremely rapid ventricular rates, and potentially deterioration to VF. Thus, an external defibrillator should always be available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H684770\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Administration and side effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calcium channel blockers or beta blockers &ndash; If SVT persists after vagal maneuvers and adenosine administration, the choice of initial pharmacologic therapies includes non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. We generally start with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> (2.5 to 5 mg IV) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> (5 to 20 mg IV), although a beta blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> 5 to 10 mg IV) may be given. These medications can terminate AVNRT or AVRT, as well as some atrial tachycardias. If the specific SVT diagnosis remains unknown, these drugs may slow the ventricular response and facilitate diagnosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardioversion &ndash; Electrical cardioversion is rarely necessary in patients with a stable SVT. However, if WCT persist after the above interventions, synchronized cardioversion is usually effective in restoring sinus rhythm. Following appropriate procedural sedation, an initial synchronized shock of 100 to 200 joules (monophasic) or 50 to 100 joules (biphasic) is administered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the arrhythmia is known to be atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or an atrial tachycardia, management options include rate control and cardioversion (ie, rhythm control). Decisions regarding which strategy is appropriate in a given patient are addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial flutter&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>After the WCT is terminated or controlled, the further management of an SVT depends upon which SVT is present.

Rarely, however, WCT can result from a pacemaker tracking an underlying atrial arrhythmia or be due to pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. Most patients with WCT involving a pacemaker will be hemodynamically stable, unless the resulting tachycardia exacerbated underlying comorbidities (eg, angina, heart failure, etc).</p><p>If the WCT is thought to be directly related to the function of the pacemaker, the appropriate therapy is the placement of a magnet over the pacemaker. The magnet will disable all pacemaker sensing, thereby terminating the ability of the pacemaker to track atrial impulses. With the magnet, the pacemaker will function in an asynchronous, fixed-rate mode (ie, VOO or DOO). In this situation, there will be pacemaker stimuli that do not sense the P wave or QRS complex and will occur with a fixed rate (ie, the lower rate limit of the pacemaker). If WCT is due to pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) or &quot;pseudo PMT&quot; (non-reentrant repetitive VA synchrony), transient magnet application will terminate the WCT, and sinus rhythm will ensue when the magnet is removed. If the WCT is due to inappropriate tracking of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, the WCT will likely resume once the magnet is removed.</p><p>Patients with pacemakers may also be subject to WCTs that do not involve the pacemaker, like other patients. In stable patients, the pacemaker programmer can be used to telemeter the intracardiac electrograms from the pacemaker leads. Examination of these electrograms may yield the diagnosis, as in the electrophysiology laboratory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254916036\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with an ICD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) represent a specific high-risk population in whom WCT is far more likely to represent VT. Patients who underwent ICD implantation for secondary prevention have previously experienced a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia or sudden cardiac death, while those who received an ICD for primary prevention were felt to be at increased risk of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In either case, WCT in patients with an ICD should be treated as VT until proven otherwise. When no ICD therapy has been delivered, and the device cannot be immediately interrogated (due either to lack of equipment or personnel, or patient instability), the initial management should proceed as if no ICD were present.</p><p>The presence of an ICD has a number of unique implications for patients with a WCT. Although the ICD should be programmed to delivery therapies (either antitachycardia pacing or shocks) for a WCT, such therapies are usually delivered within the first minutes of the arrhythmia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with a persistent or recurrent WCT, the ICD may not always provide definitive management if the device has reached the limit of programmed therapies. Patients with a WCT which persists following multiple ICD therapies most likely have either VT storm with an underlying trigger (eg, ischemia, hypokalemia) or an SVT with aberrant conduction which recurs or persists in spite of the ICD therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrical-storm-and-incessant-ventricular-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrical storm and incessant ventricular tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with and ICD and WCT will not receive therapy from the ICD if the WCT rate is lower than the programmed rate for ICD therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an ICD who receive multiple shocks but do not have a tachycardia most likely have device malfunction, usually related to lead malfunction. In these patients, magnet application can temporarily suspend tachycardia therapy and prevent further inappropriate shocks. Magnet application is also appropriate in patients receiving shocks for narrow complex tachyarrhythmias (SVT, AF, atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic devices: Long-term complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>All modern ICDs also have the capacity to function as a pacemaker. Patients with a single lead ICD (typically an endovascular lead in the right ventricle) cannot sense and track atrial arrhythmias and, as such, are not subject to WCT associated with the device. Conversely, patients with both an atrial and a ventricular lead have the capacity to sense and track atrial arrhythmias and therefore can potentially develop WCT associated with the pacemaker. However, given the risk of WCT representing VT in a patient with an ICD, pacemaker-associated WCT should be considered only after exclusion of other WCT etiologies and following ICD interrogation. Magnet application does not force asynchronous pacing in ICDs and will therefore not terminate PMT in patients with ICDs. As in pacemaker patients, telemetered intracardiac recordings may be helpful diagnostically. (See <a href=\"#H254423892\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a pacemaker'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528288519\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent or refractory WCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the WCT recurs or persists following initial attempts at vagal maneuvers, diagnostic pharmacologic interventions, and electrical cardioversion, suppression of the arrhythmia by pharmacologic means should be attempted and further evaluation should focus upon the presence of arrhythmia triggers (eg, ischemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and drug toxicity). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> is generally the most effective agent for treatment of recurrent or refractory WCT, particularly VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias-approach-to-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].
