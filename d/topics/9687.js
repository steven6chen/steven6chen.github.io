Initially, engorgement occurs because of poor milk drainage, probably related to nipple trauma with resultant swelling and compression of one or more milk ducts. If symptoms persist beyond 12 to 24 hours, the condition of infective lactational mastitis develops (since breast milk contains bacteria); this is characterized by pain, redness, fever, and malaise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactational-mastitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Issues related to lactational mastitis will be reviewed here.

Effective management and prevention of recurrence depends on resolution of the above factors.</p><p>The pathogenesis of lactational mastitis is complex and may include poorly understood interactions between the mammary-associated microbiota and host-specific genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactational-mastitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The risk of developing lactational mastitis can be reduced by frequent, complete emptying of the breast and by optimizing breastfeeding technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactational-mastitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3501752601\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most episodes of lactational mastitis are caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.

Infective lactational mastitis typically presents as a firm, red, painful, swollen area of one breast associated with fever &gt;38.3&ordm;C in a nursing mother; milk secretion may be diminished. Systemic complaints may include myalgia, chills, malaise, and flu-like symptoms.</p><p>In the early stages, the presentation can be subtle with few clinical signs; patients with advanced infection may present with a large area of breast swelling with overlying skin erythema. Reactive axillary lymphadenopathy may be associated with axillary pain and swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19212319\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of mastitis is based on clinical manifestations; laboratory tests are not needed.</p><p>Culture of the breast milk can be useful to guide selection of antibiotics; it is particularly important in the setting of infection that is severe, hospital acquired, or unresponsive to initial empiric antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactational-mastitis/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Blood cultures are warranted in the setting of severe infection (eg, hemodynamic instability, progressive erythema) but are otherwise not routinely necessary.</p><p>Imaging is useful if lactational mastitis does not respond within 48 to 72 hours to supportive care and antibiotics. Ultrasound is the most effective method of differentiating mastitis from breast abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactational-mastitis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>].

Mastitis may be distinguished from severe engorgement in that engorgement is bilateral, with generalized involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactational-mastitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Engorgement is not typically associated with systemic symptoms of fever and myalgia.

A tender fluctuant area is suggestive of an abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactational-mastitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ultrasonography is the most effective method of differentiating mastitis from a breast abscess and also facilitates guided drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62711\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62711 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lactational-mastitis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>].

Symptoms include a palpable lump with tenderness. A plugged duct may be distinguished from mastitis and breast abscess by the absence of systemic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;, section on 'Plugged ducts'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Galactocele &ndash; A galactocele (also known as a milk retention cyst) is a cystic collection of fluid that is usually caused by an obstructed milk duct. Galactoceles present as soft cystic masses; they are not tender and are not associated with systemic manifestations. Ultrasonography may demonstrate a simple milk cyst or a complex mass. The diagnosis can be made on the basis of the clinical history and needle aspiration, which yields a milky substance.

Erythema may improve to some degree with antibiotics in patients with IBC, but there are usually other manifestations of IBC present; IBC may be differentiated from mastitis by clinical manifestations of skin thickening due to edema, erythema, and peau d'orange appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65383 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70894 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82220\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82220 \">picture 3</a>). It is often associated with axillary lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is established via biopsy.
