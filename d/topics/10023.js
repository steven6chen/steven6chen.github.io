Scleromyxedema and myxedema associated with thyroid disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scleromyxedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scleromyxedema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretibial myxedema (thyroid dermopathy) in autoimmune thyroid disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3600118832\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic data on localized LM are limited. Localized LM appears to be rare and less prevalent than scleromyxedema, though the frequency of this disorder is probably underestimated. Acral persistent papular mucinosis (APPM) is the most frequently reported variant of localized LM, with fewer than 50 reports of patients with APPM in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>The primary populations affected by the various subtypes of localized LM differ. APPM usually develops in adults and is more frequent in women than men. In a literature review that evaluated reports of 32 patients with APPM, the mean patient age was 50 years (range 14 to 77 years) and 25 of the 32 patients (78 percent) were female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Discrete papular lichen myxedematosus affects adults of both genders, with a slight prevalence in males. Nodular lichen myxedematosus has primarily been reported in young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] but has also occurred in a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cutaneous mucinosis of infancy is present at birth or appears in early infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539329058\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of LM is unknown. The main hypothesis is that circulating cytokines known to stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis and fibroblast proliferation in the skin, such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, it has been suggested that an intrinsic abnormality of fibroblasts in patients with LM may result in increased glycosaminoglycan synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Clinical observations suggest that other factors, such as viral infections (eg, human immunodeficiency virus infection), surgery (eg, joint replacement) or other physical trauma, and radiation therapy, may stimulate mucin and collagen production, contributing to the development of localized LM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition, discrete papular lichen myxedematosus has been described in the setting of toxic oil syndrome caused by contaminated rapeseed oil and L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'Contaminated rapeseed oil'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'L-tryptophan'</a>.)</p><p>A pathogenic mechanism that involves paraproteins acting as autoantibodies that stimulate fibroblasts to proliferate and overproduce mucin has been proposed for the scleromyxedema subtype of LM. However, there are data that conflict with this theory, and localized LM is unlikely to share this mechanism given the typical absence of associated paraproteinemia in this variant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scleromyxedema#H27631287\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scleromyxedema&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>A genetic predisposition to localized LM has been proposed based upon a report of a child with cutaneous mucinosis of infancy whose father had similar cutaneous lesions during his childhood and a report of acral persistent papular mucinosis in two sisters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

In addition, an association of DPLM with chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus infection has been reported, most often in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monoclonal gammopathy and hypergammaglobulinemia</strong> &ndash; An absence of associated monoclonal gammopathy is a diagnostic criterion for localized LM, and the presence of monoclonal gammopathy in a patient with clinical and histologic findings consistent with localized LM is considered an atypical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111850 \">table 2</a>).

Clinical, histologic, and laboratory findings aid in distinguishing these disorders. Clinically, the eruption of scleromyxedema is more diffuse and sclerodermoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91118%7EDERM%2F91120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91118 graphicRef91120 \">picture 4A-B</a>). The classic histopathologic findings of scleromyxedema are a microscopic triad of mucin deposition, fibroblast proliferation, and fibrosis; rarely, an interstitial granuloma annulare-like pattern is detected. Unlike localized LM, scleromyxedema occurs in association with monoclonal gammopathy and can have a variety of extracutaneous manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scleromyxedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scleromyxedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other disorders</strong> &ndash; The differential diagnosis of localized LM also includes cutaneous papular eruptions, particularly those that may present with white, skin-colored, or erythematous, smooth papules, plaques, or nodules, such as granuloma annulare, molluscum contagiosum, acrokeratoelastoidosis, lichen amyloidosis, lichen planus, and eruptive collagenoma as well as other forms of cutaneous mucinosis (eg, pretibial myxedema, reticulated erythematous mucinosis, follicular mucinosis). Review of the clinical findings and a skin biopsy distinguishes localized LM from these disorders. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional disorders in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous mucinosis of infancy are self-healing juvenile cutaneous mucinosis (SHJCM) and mucinous nevus. SHJCM is characterized by an acute eruption of papules that may coalesce to form linear infiltrated plaques on the face, neck, scalp, abdomen, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thighs of children. Mucinous subcutaneous nodules on the face associated with periorbital swelling and on periarticular areas are sometimes predominant features. Patients can have systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgias, weakness, and muscle tenderness. A skin biopsy will show a fibroblastic reactive proliferation involving the subcutaneous fat similar to nodular or proliferative fasciitis, with mucin deposited throughout the dermis and subcutis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Spontaneous resolution typically occurs within a few weeks to several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mucinous nevus is a congenital or acquired hamartomatous connective tissue nevus that manifests as a unilateral eruption of multiple brown to skin-colored papules or plaques in a linear or zosteriform arrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Although localized LM and scleromyxedema belong to a spectrum of disease, progression of localized LM to scleromyxedema has not been proven. </p><p>Given the benign and skin-limited nature of localized LM, clinical and laboratory follow-up is not needed for patients with typical disease presentations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1639919262\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localized LM is a benign condition for which treatment is not required. We typically reassure patients regarding the benign nature of localized LM and do not initiate treatment. </p><p>However, the appearance of localized LM is bothersome for some patients and has led to attempts at treatment. There is no uniformly effective therapy. Treatments that have seemed beneficial for individual patients with discrete papular lichen myxedematosus (DPLM) or acral persistent papular mucinosis include medical therapies (topical or intralesional corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]) and destructive surgical therapies (dermabrasion, electrosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/4,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,32</a>], carbon dioxide laser, erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]). However, responses to these interventions vary, and surgical therapies are associated with risk for scarring. Partial or complete resolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated DPLM within several months after the initiation or a change in antiretroviral therapy has been documented in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Improvement of nodular lichen myxedematosus with intralesional corticosteroid injections or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> has been described in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus/abstract/6,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34</a>].

Localized LM should be distinguished from scleromyxedema, a form of LM that presents with a <span class=\"nowrap\">diffuse/generalized</span> papular and sclerodermoid eruption, monoclonal gammopathy, and the potential for systemic involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91118%7EDERM%2F91120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91118 graphicRef91120 \">picture 4A-B</a>).

APPM, DPLM, and nodular LM typically occur in adults. CMI is present at birth or develops in early infancy. DPLM can occur in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. (See <a href=\"#H3600118832\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1261566085\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical presentations of localized LM with monoclonal gammopathy or overlapping features of the different subtypes have been reported.

Spontaneous resolution of HIV-associated DPLM has been reported. Progression to scleromyxedema does not appear to occur. (See <a href=\"#H3850956185\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized LM is a benign condition. Treatment is not necessary. A variety of medical and surgical treatments have been tried with variable results.
