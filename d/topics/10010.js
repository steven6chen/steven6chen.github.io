However, in appropriately selected patients, it is clear that transplantation offers an excellent survival advantage similar to that for other disease indications. Prior reluctance stemmed from the perception that the disease was self-inflicted and from concern regarding the risk of alcohol-related damage to sites outside the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Transplantation is generally considered when a patient has suffered either a complication of portal hypertension or a manifestation of compromised hepatic function. The indications for liver transplantation are discussed separately.

However, it is unclear how often patients who are transplant candidates are not being referred for evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a study of nearly 200 potential liver transplantation candidates according to the American Association for the study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, patients with alcoholic liver disease were less likely to receive counseling regarding liver transplantation compared with patients with cirrhosis of another etiology (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this cohort, 41 patients with cirrhosis (21 percent) were referred for transplant evaluation and the most common reason for not referring patients was active alcohol use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H427470577\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall risk of alcohol relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In appropriately selected patients, the alcohol relapse rate after transplantation generally ranges from 10 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>].

Some transplantation programs and society guidelines suggest that no absolute interval of abstinence is required because some patients who are otherwise suitable candidates will not survive a period of six months. (See <a href=\"#H4238569736\" class=\"local\">'Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Based on the available studies, it is unclear whether the six-month abstinence requirement significantly reduces the rate of relapse after transplantation or improves outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/7,11,20,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,20,27,28</a>].<em> </em>While the six-month abstinence requirement is somewhat arbitrary, some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/7,27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27,29</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/11,20,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20,28</a>] studies have found that longer duration of abstinence before transplant is associated with lower alcohol relapse rates after transplant.

In a study of 134 such patients in whom alcohol use was defined as a positive blood alcohol level, self-reported alcohol use or refusal to check a blood alcohol level within 12 hours of the request, alcohol use was less likely in patients with a higher number of random blood alcohol level checks (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.76) and with a longer duration of prelisting abstinence (RR 0.88, 95% 0.83-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Excessive drinking after liver transplantation may be associated with rapidly progressive liver injury, allograft failure, and fatal alcoholic hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/19,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,54,55</a>]. In a study of 300 patients with alcoholic liver disease who underwent transplantation, patients who relapsed were more likely to develop steatohepatitis (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.7-22.7) and advanced (stage 3 or higher) fibrosis (OR 23.2, 95% CI 3.1-177.3) compared with those who maintained abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In another study, 128 of 712 patients who underwent liver transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis had a severe alcoholic relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among the patients with a severe relapse, 41 (32 percent) developed recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis after a median of 5.1 years. Survival at 10 and 15 years was lower among patients with severe alcoholic relapse compared with those who did not have a severe relapse (50 versus 70 percent at 10 years and 21 versus 41 percent at 15 years). A separate report also suggested impaired survival after 10 years in patients who resumed drinking, possibly because of an increased risk of death from cancer and cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>The continued use of alcohol by patients after liver transplantation may also increase the likelihood that they will be lost to follow-up, leading to an underestimate of the impact of alcohol use on outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448290166\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We monitor patients with a history of alcoholic liver disease for recurrent alcohol use following liver transplantation by clinical interview and by testing of urine ethyl glucuronide (uEtG) at each follow-up outpatient visit and randomly, if needed.

They also must complete an alcohol treatment program when medically appropriate following transplantation (usually three to six months postoperatively). </p><p>Few studies have addressed the utility of post-liver transplantation alcohol treatment programs in preventing relapse. In a study of 103 patients with alcoholic liver disease who underwent transplantation, participation in an alcohol treatment program resulted in lower rates of any alcohol use during a four-year follow-up period (22 versus 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the United Kingdom, all patients who undergo transplantation for alcoholic liver disease are followed by an addiction treatment psychiatrist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Such a program is recommended but not mandatory in the United States. </p><p>Psychosocial and pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplantation is an appropriate treatment option for some patients with alcoholic liver disease and is generally considered when a patient has suffered either a complication of portal hypertension or a manifestation of compromised hepatic function. Such patients should be referred for transplantation as early referral is an important determinant of success. (See <a href=\"#H2724861533\" class=\"local\">'Timing of referral'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abstinence is an expectation for patients on the transplant waiting list. Most studies suggest that longer durations of abstinence pre-transplantation are associated with reduced rates of relapse after transplant; six-month abstinence is a common requirement in many centers. In addition, other centers monitor patients for alcohol use <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> require that patients participate in an alcohol treatment program. The efficacy of these measures in preventing alcohol relapse after transplantation and improving other outcomes is unknown.<em> </em>(See <a href=\"#H599304101\" class=\"local\">'Pre-transplant abstinence and monitoring'</a> above.)<em> </em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient survival rates following liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease are similar to rates following transplantation for non-alcohol related diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H3729699156\" class=\"local\">'Mortality and graft survival'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol relapse after transplantation occurs in 10 to 30 percent of patients and is associated with increased risk of graft rejection, graft loss, and recurrent alcoholic liver disease as well as decreased survival. The accuracy of predictors of relapse is incompletely understood but, poor social support, a family history of alcohol dependence, and pre-transplantation abstinence of &le;6 months are some of the predictors that may be important. (See <a href=\"#H459691248\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for alcohol relapse'</a> above and <a href=\"#H963614413\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent harmful alcohol use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with a history of alcoholic liver disease participate in an alcohol treatment program following liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking is a significant risk factor for post-transplant morbidity and mortality. We suggest that patients with alcoholic liver disease who smoke undergo counseling and treatment for smoking cessation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H828336315\" class=\"local\">'Smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver transplantation may be an option for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who do not respond to glucocorticoids. It has been suggested that the six-month period of abstinence be reconsidered in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis and that methods to identify transplant candidates who are at low risk of relapse are needed.
