However, the cause of MS remains unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The most widely accepted theory is that MS begins as an inflammatory immune-mediated disorder characterized by autoreactive lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].

EAE itself is an imperfect model of MS, as it does not exactly parallel its clinical or pathological features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1,6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,15</a>]. In addition, EAE is responsive to many drugs directed against T cells (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and monoclonal antibodies directed at CD4 cells). These same drugs have failed to consistently demonstrate effectiveness as therapies for MS.</p><p>In addition to loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes, axonal injury is a prominent pathologic feature of the MS plaque (see <a href=\"#H721369662\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below).

These lesions tend to be located in the optic nerves, spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, and the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, demyelinated lesions can also be found in the corpus callosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and cortical gray matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Axonal injury can be a prominent pathologic feature of the MS plaque, though not in the acute phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/18,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27-29</a>].</p><p>Although traditionally considered a disease of focal white matter lesions, the spectrum of MS pathology is now understood to encompass a broader array of abnormalities, including diffuse damage of so-called normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM) on MRI, both of which are associated with a progressive loss of brain volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Inflammatory cortical demyelination has been found in 38 percent of biopsy-proven cases of early MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The core MS clinical phenotypes are those of relapsing and progressive disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis#H605008275\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical course and classification of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Disease pattern'</a>). However, the pathology of brain injury in relapsing and progressive forms of MS is probably not fundamentally different, though some reports have suggested that progressive forms of MS are marked by reduced or absent inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] or by a global inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. More convincing evidence suggests that primary progressive MS is part of the clinical spectrum of MS and is not pathophysiologically different from relapsing MS that has evolved into a secondary progressive phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/31,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548438790\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among central nervous system disorders, MS is the most frequent cause of permanent disability in young adults, aside from trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. MS affects more women than men. A systematic review of 28 epidemiologic studies found that, from 1955 to 2000, the estimated female to male ratio of MS incidence increased from 1.4:1 to 2.3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. At least one study suggested an even higher female to male ratio of &gt;3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A later systematic review and meta-analysis also reported evidence suggesting that the incidence of MS is increasing in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The reason for this is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A case-control study from Crete noted that an increase in the incidence of MS in women since 1980 was concurrent with a population shift from rural to urban areas, and speculated that environmental factors accompanying urbanization may trigger the development of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The incidence and prevalence of MS varies geographically, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H548438808\" class=\"local\">'Geographic factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The mean age of MS onset ranges from 28 to 31 years in various studies; clinical disease usually becomes apparent between the ages of 15 to 45 years, though clinical onset rarely occurs as early as the first years of life or as late as the seventh decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mean age of onset is a few years earlier for women than for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Relapsing-remitting MS has an earlier onset, averaging 25 to 29 years; this may convert to secondary progressive MS at a mean age of 40 to 49 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Primary progressive MS has a mean age of onset of 39 to 41 years.</p><p>In support of a possible autoimmune basis for MS (see <a href=\"#H548437364\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above), some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] studies have observed that patients with MS are more likely than controls to have other autoimmune disorders. However, the majority of such studies are limited in quality, as noted in a systematic review of comorbid autoimmune disease in MS; based upon a meta-analysis of population-based studies, the most prevalent autoimmune conditions identified by the systematic review were psoriasis and thyroid disease (7.7 and 6.4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The results also suggested that MS is associated with a possible increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis, and pemphigoid. </p><p>In addition, patients with other autoimmune disorders are more likely to have MS. A large Danish study found that patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus had an increased risk for developing MS compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Another large, well-designed cohort study found that patients with inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk for demyelinating diseases, including MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H721368546\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are over 100 polymorphisms associated with MS in various studies. Among the strongest association is that the risk of developing MS is related to certain class I and class II alleles of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), particularly the HLA-DRB1 locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-53</a>]. Mounting evidence suggests that the risk of MS is associated with multiple non-MHC susceptibility genes of modest effect (eg, CD6, CLEC16A, IL2RA, IL7R, IRF8, and TNFRSF1A) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/51,52,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52,54-56</a>]. In addition, polymorphisms in the IL-7R gene may slightly increase the risk of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/49,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,57,58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H548437364\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>The presence of a vitamin D response (VDRE) element located in the promoter region of many but not all HLA-DRB1 alleles suggests that environmental differences in vitamin D might interact with HLA-DRB1 to influence the risk of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, other factors related to HLA variation may have more impact on MS risk than vitamin D regulation of HLA-DR expression. In one study of Australian Caucasians that compared 466 MS cases and 498 controls, the risk of developing MS varied more than 10-fold according to HLA-DRB1 allele type and associated sequence variation in the promoter region, with odds ratios ranging from 0.28 to 3.06 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A protective effect was associated with HLA-DRB1*04, *07, and *09 (DR53 group) alleles, while DRB1*15 and *16 (DR51 group) and *08 (DR8 group) were associated with a higher risk. However, VDRE sequence variation itself was not independently associated with MS risk. Most of the Caucasian HLA-DRB1 alleles expressed a functional VDRE sequence, including alleles that had no apparent effect on MS risk. Further, in a study from Sardinia, where the prevalence of MS is high, the VDREs associated with several of the HLA-DRB1 variants linked to MS risk in Sardinians were often mutated and nonfunctional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. These results suggest that, at least in Sardinia, the effect of vitamin D on HLA-DRB1 expression as mediated by VDRE is quite limited. Instead, among Sardinians, polymorphisms in B-cell activating factor (BAFF) regulatory elements has a very high relationship to the development of MS, as discussed below.</p><p>In twin studies, the risk of developing MS for dizygotic twin pairs is the same as that for siblings (3 to 5 percent); however, the risk for monozygotic twins is at least 20 percent and may reach close to 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. For purposes of genetic counseling, the sibling risk of MS is 3 to 5 percent. Studies of unaffected family members that have noted abnormalities on MRI scanning suggest that the risk may be even higher.</p><p>The frequency of familial MS varies from 3 percent to 23 percent in different studies. One well-designed population study of 8205 Danish patients with MS found that the relative lifetime risk of MS was increased sevenfold (95% CI 5.8-8.8) among first-degree relatives (n = 19,615) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The excess familial lifetime risk for first-degree relatives was 2.5 percent (95% CI 2.0-3.2) in addition to the sporadic absolute risk of MS in Danish women and men of 0.5 and 0.3 percent, respectively. These sporadic rates from the Danish population are among the highest in the world.</p><p>Accumulating data suggest that susceptibility of MS is influenced by the sex of the affected parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/64-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-70</a>]. Most but not all studies have found a maternal parent-of-origin effect, with an excess of maternal inheritance of MS susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/64,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,68,69</a>]. In contrast, studies of parent-child pairs with MS have found that paternal transmission is equal to or greater than maternal transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. The explanation for this discrepancy is unclear, but epigenetic mechanisms (eg, DNA modifications such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation that do not modify the DNA sequence) transmitted through cell division may be involved in direct transmission from an affected parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>As genome-wide association studies increase in size, the ability to detect risk alleles conferring even very small increases in MS susceptibility increases. In a report published in 2013 that focused on genetic variants associated with immune function, the number of genetic variants linked to MS risk was &gt;100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Although the precise functional effects of these variants are mostly unknown, they are over-represented in regulatory as opposed to coding regions of genes associated with immunologic function, and many of the variants are associated with other autoimmune conditions as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. As an example, a genome-wide association study focused on a population from Sardinia, where there is a high prevalence of MS and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. A variant in the TNFSF13B gene, encoding B-cell activating factor (BAFF), was associated with both MS and SLE. The proposed mechanism is that the TNFSF13B variant causes higher production of soluble BAFF, leading to enhanced humoral immunity and an increased risk of autoimmunity.

Additionally, children with MS are significantly more likely than healthy peers to have serological evidence for prior EBV infection, at an age when EBV seropositivity is much less common than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>While these findings do not confirm that EBV is an etiologic agent, they warrant further study.</p><p>Cytomegalovirus infection has been shown to potentially be associated with protection from MS in two case-control studies, one of which focused on pediatric-onset MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] and the other of which focused on a broad range of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The latter study found the negative association was persistent when pediatric-onset MS cases were removed from the analysis, suggesting that cytomegalovirus infection is also protective for adult-onset MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. However, it is not clear how such an infection would be protective.</p><p>Varicella zoster virus (VZV) has also been linked to MS in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>]. A case-control study found viral particles identical to VZV, and DNA from VZV, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with acute relapses of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Viral particles were not seen in CSF samples from cases of MS in remission or in samples from control subjects, and DNA from VZV was not seen in most patients in remission. These findings suggest that VZV may participate in, or be activated at the same time as, MS exacerbations.

In support of this theory, a population-based case-control study found that higher exposure to infant siblings during the first six years of life was inversely associated with the risk of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The proposed explanation was that greater infant sibling exposure leads to increased early life infection exposure or reexposure; this in turn confers protection against autoimmunity later in life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548438808\"><span class=\"h3\">Geographic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and prevalence of MS varies geographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. High frequency areas of the world (prevalence of 60 per 100,000 or more) include all of Europe (including Asian Russia), southern Canada, northern United States, New Zealand, and southeast Australia. In many of these areas, the prevalence is more than 100 per 100,000; the highest reported rate (300 per 100,000) is in the Orkney Islands. In the United States, the estimated prevalence is 100 to 150 per 100,000, for a total of 300,000 to 400,000 persons with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>].

However, subsequent studies in the United States demonstrated an increased incidence of MS in black adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>] and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>], suggesting that this racial susceptibility may be changing.</p><p>There is also a widely held belief of an association between latitude and MS, with the risk of MS increasing from south to north [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In an analysis from the Nurses' Health Study, for example, the adjusted rate ratios were 3.5 for the northern United States and 2.7 for the middle tiers relative to the southern tier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Persons migrating from a high- to low-risk area after the age of puberty are thought to carry their former high risk with them, while those that migrate during childhood seem to have the risk associated with the new area to which they migrated.</p><p>However, the universal association between latitude and risk of MS has been challenged by findings from a 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Thus, there was no latitudinal gradient for MS incidence in the northern hemisphere.

A number of studies have suggested an association between tobacco smoking and MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. As examples, a cross-sectional study of 22,312 people in Norway found a higher risk of MS in ever-smokers than in never-smokers (relative risk 1.81, 95% CI 1.13-2.92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>], and a case-control study in the United Kingdom found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].

In contrast, a population-based case-control study from Sweden reported that use of oral snuff (smokeless tobacco) was not associated with MS risk among patients who did not smoke cigarettes, while greater use of oral snuff appeared to be protective against MS among those who did smoke cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. This finding suggests that nicotine is not responsible for the increased risk of MS among tobacco smokers, but more data are needed.</p><p>Birth month has been implicated as a possible risk factor for MS, though the literature is conflicting.

However, it is possible that studies finding a month of birth effect are actually false positive results that result from confounding caused by seasonal variation in birth rates, with data from Europe and North America showing excess births in March, April, or May, and reduced births in November, December, and January [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>Obesity in childhood or adolescence may also be a risk factor for MS, as suggested by several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/128-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">128-130</a>].</p><p>Eighty percent of the immune system cells reside in the gastrointestinal tract, and there is some evidence that the microbiome of patients with MS differs from healthy controls.

Inflammation, demyelination, and axon degeneration are the major pathologic mechanisms that cause the clinical manifestations. However, the cause of MS remains unknown. The most widely accepted theory is that MS begins as an inflammatory autoimmune disorder mediated by autoreactive lymphocytes. Later, the disease is dominated by microglial activation and chronic neurodegeneration. (See <a href=\"#H548437364\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H721369145\" class=\"local\">'Immunopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternate theories of MS pathogenesis include an immune (but not autoimmune) etiology due to a chronic viral infection, a nonimmune noninflammatory etiology due to a genetically determined neuroglial degenerative process, and chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). (See <a href=\"#H721369151\" class=\"local\">'Alternate theories'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple sclerosis affects more women than men; the estimated female-to-male ratio of MS incidence is approximately 2:1, with some data suggesting the ratio is even higher. The median and mean ages of MS onset are 23.5 and 30 years of age, respectively. The peak age of onset is about five years earlier for women than for men. Onset of MS can rarely occur as late as the seventh decade.
