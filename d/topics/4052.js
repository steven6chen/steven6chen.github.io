It is considered to be synonymous (ie, one disease at different stages) to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The malignant cells seen in SLL and CLL have identical pathologic and immunophenotypic features. A distinction between these two diagnoses is made based upon the patient's clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of SLL will be reviewed here.

Less than 10 percent of patients present with a non-leukemic picture having only nodal involvement (ie, SLL); this presentation accounts for less than 5 percent of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. However, most patients with SLL at presentation ultimately develop bone marrow and blood infiltration (CLL).</p><p>The median age at diagnosis is 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Both hepatosplenomegaly and extranodal infiltrates may be seen.</p><p>The peripheral blood in patients with SLL may be normal or reveal only a mild lymphocytosis; by definition, patients with SLL have an absolute lymphocyte count of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;5000/microL</span> at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A serum paraprotein or hypogammaglobulinemia is found in 20 and 40 percent of cases, respectively. As with patients with CLL, patients with SLL may develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2 microglobulin may also occur.

While SLL lymphocytes are described as mature-appearing cells, they are, in fact, immature both functionally and developmentally. There are three major characteristic immunophenotypic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of B cell associated antigens including CD19, CD20, and CD23.

The immunoglobulin is most often IgM or both IgM and IgD, and only a single immunoglobulin light chain is expressed (ie, either kappa or lambda but not both), confirming the clonal nature of these cells.</p><p/><p>In addition, SLL cells express HLA-DR and are usually negative for cyclin D1 and CD10. FMC7, CD22, and CD79b are also commonly negative or weakly expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cytoplasmic immunoglobulin is detectable in about 5 percent of the cases. Approximately 40 percent of the cases express CD38 on &gt;30 percent of the cells.

In early studies, most cases (75 percent) of SLL did not show somatic mutation of their variable (V) regions, suggesting that they corresponded to a cell that had not yet undergone antigen selection in the germinal center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

It is anticipated, but not yet proven that SLL will share these same sets of mutations.

SLL is a tissue infiltrate with the morphology and immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in a patient with an insufficient number of circulating leukemia cells to fulfill the criteria for CLL. Specifically, patients with lymphadenopathy without cytopenias and an absolute peripheral B lymphocyte count that is less than <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> [5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L]</span> are given the diagnosis of SLL rather than CLL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for SLL includes other small B cell lymphoproliferative disorders such as mantle cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The most reliable morphologic distinction is that SLL is associated with the presence of proliferation centers in the involved lymph nodes, whereas other low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative disorders are not. It is important to note that SLL can convert to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (Richter's transformation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81166 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Mantle cell lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLL cells can show moderate nuclear irregularity much like those seen in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In addition, MCL can have a leukemic phase that may mimic CLL. Like the malignant cells of SLL, MCL tumors coexpress CD5 and CD20. However, the neoplastic cells of MCL typically stain strongly for cyclin D1 and surface membrane immunoglobulin (SmIg), have a t(11;14) chromosomal abnormality in greater than 90 percent of cases, and are negative for CD23. In contrast, the malignant cells in <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> are typically negative for cyclin D1 and are often CD23 positive.</p><p>Some cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> may be CD23-, and MCL can be CD23+; in such tumors, stains for cyclin D1 take on particular importance. Rare cases of CLL with cyclin D1 gene rearrangement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cyclin D1 overexpression have been reported; these tend to pursue an unusually aggressive clinical course distinct from typical B-CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The presence of clear-cut proliferation centers excludes the diagnosis of MCL.

However, HCL almost never involves lymph nodes, whereas lymphadenopathy is the rule in SLL. The abnormal B cell in SLL usually stains positively for CD5, an antigen rarely expressed in HCL. Conversely, HCL is usually positive for CD103, an antigen rarely if ever expressed in SLL. In marrow biopsies, SLL often is present in a nodular pattern, whereas HCL involves the marrow in an interstitial pattern without nodularity.

In addition, the tumors cells are small in size. However, one of the most notable morphologic features of FL is its nodular growth pattern, which is not seen in SLL. On occasion, proliferation centers are so prominent in <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> that involved lymph nodes can take on a mottled &quot;pseudo-nodular&quot; appearance. However, these two entities differ in their immunophenotype. In contrast to FL, tumor cells in SLL do not express CD10; conversely, unlike SLL, tumor cells in FL do not express CD5.
