These sacs are filled with fluid. They help cushion and protect the joints. &quot;Bursitis&quot; is the medical term for when one of these sacs gets irritated or inflamed. People whose hip pain is caused by bursitis usually feel more pain if they lay on their side, or if someone presses against the side of their hip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscle or tendon strain</strong> &ndash; Three major muscle groups help move the hip. Overuse of these muscles, or the tendons that attach them to the bones, can lead to hip pain. Pain caused by muscle or tendon strain tends to be worse when you move the leg in one particular direction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nerve problems</strong> &ndash; Lots of nerves pass by the hip. These nerves or nerves in the lower part of the spine can get pressed on or damaged and cause hip pain. People with pain caused by nerve problems also often feel tingling or numbness in the area. A pinched nerve in the spine could cause other problems, such as weakness in the leg.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473802250\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse for my hip pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pain is sudden and severe, prevents you from putting weight on that side, or is so bad that you can't rotate your leg to the side. Some people who have hip pain actually have a broken hip bone. This is especially likely after a fall or even a mild impact. Having a broken hip is serious and needs immediate medical attention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your hip is swollen, bruised, or bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You also have a fever along with your hip pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have weakness in one of your legs or feet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473802257\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hip pain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right treatment for hip pain depends on what is causing it. In general, treatments might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines to reduce pain and inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting a shot of a medicine called a steroid, which can reduce inflammation (these steroids are not the same ones athletes take to build up muscle)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy or exercises recommended by the doctor</p><p/><p>If you have severe hip arthritis, your doctor or nurse might suggest surgery to replace the hip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473802264\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Here are some things you can try:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor if there are stretches or exercises that can help with the cause of your pain. Before you do these exercises, warm up your muscles by taking a warm shower or bath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider taking non-prescription pain medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). But if you have heart disease or other health problems, or if you are on prescription medicines, ask your doctor before you start taking any new medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a cane, walker, shoe insert, or other device, if it helps you</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473802271\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bursitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-replacement-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip replacement (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-falls-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing falls (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bursitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Total hip replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
