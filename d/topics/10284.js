Morbidity and mortality are almost entirely due to disease progression within the peritoneum and not to distant metastatic spread.</p><p>This topic review will cover the treatment of MPM. The epidemiology, histology, clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of MPM, as well as the treatment of pleural, pericardial, and tunica vaginalis mesothelioma are presented elsewhere.

Due to the rarity of this entity, most of the available clinical information about MPM treatment is derived from retrospective single-center series, which have inherent selection biases. Prospective clinical trials are few and small, and there are currently no randomized studies that compare one treatment with another. Much of the data on systemic chemotherapy in MPM are derived from pharmaceutical company Expanded Access Programs, which have more heterogeneous patient populations and less rigorous response assessment and toxicity reporting than a prospective clinical trial. Determinations about the activity of chemotherapeutic agents are often extrapolated from the more extensive data available from patients with pleural mesothelioma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-unresectable-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Compounding the difficulty of interpreting data from select small series, MPM is quite heterogeneous in its clinical behavior (particularly between men and women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. There are many prognostic variables, some of which are only evident at surgical evaluation. The different histologic types have different natural histories; the sarcomatoid or biphasic subtype has a worse prognosis than the more common epithelial subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], and there are two variants, both of which arise predominantly in women, that are associated with indolent clinical behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Histology'</a> and <a href=\"#H135336351\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal mesothelioma variants'</a> below.)</p><p>The following sections will focus on diffuse MPM, the most common type of clinical presentation. Management of the well-differentiated papillary and multicystic variants is described below. (See <a href=\"#H135336351\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal mesothelioma variants'</a> below.)</p><p>Diffuse MPM was originally treated with a combination of systemic chemotherapy, palliative surgery, and whole abdominal irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The regimen was exceedingly toxic; median survival was less than one year, and long-term survival was uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The median survival for untreated patients is approximately six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A Turkish series of 35 patients with MPM provides contemporary insight into the natural history of the disease, as most patients received palliative chemotherapy or supportive care only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mean age was 59 years and the overall survival time from diagnosis was 16 months. In multivariate analysis, patients who were over age 60, individuals who were exposed to asbestos for &gt;20 years, and those who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57945 \">table 1</a>) at diagnosis were more likely to have a&#8239; poor prognosis. Performance status at diagnosis was the strongest predictor of poor outcome.</p><p>As experience with cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy has accumulated, particularly over the last 10 years, marked improvements in outcome have been reported compared with historical controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among centers with expertise in this form of therapy, reported median survival for appropriately selected patients approaches three to four years. For patients who are not candidates for this approach due to unresectable disease or medical comorbidities, systemic chemotherapy with contemporary pemetrexed-based regimens achieves response rates comparable to those seen in patients with pleural mesothelioma and is now commonly incorporated into the treatment algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135336274\"><span class=\"h1\">CYTOREDUCTIVE SURGERY AND INTRAPERITONEAL CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For selected patients with diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM), no extraperitoneal disease spread, a good performance status, and who can be predicted to achieve complete surgical cytoreduction, we recommend regional therapy using cytoreduction surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal perfusion with chemotherapy (HIPEC). At the University of Maryland, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a>. Although randomized trials have not been conducted, as the number of centers utilizing this approach has expanded, particularly over the last five years, marked improvements in outcome have been reported compared with historical controls. Among centers with expertise in this form of therapy, reported median survival approaches five years. Referral of these patients to a center with surgical expertise in the management of MPM is preferred.</p><p>Over the last decade, aggressive regional therapy using CRS and intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy has been increasingly applied to selected patients with peritoneal surface malignancies, including pseudomyxoma peritonei and MPM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the appendix and pseudomyxoma peritonei&quot;, section on 'Aggressive cytoreduction and intraperitoneal chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for this therapy in MPM is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MPM remains confined to the peritoneal cavity in the majority of cases. Because the peritoneal implants are often superficial and do not invade the underlying tissues deeply until the late stages, the disease is amenable to complete or near complete cytoreduction in over one-half of all patients undergoing exploration. The completeness of surgical cytoreduction is a major prognostic factor (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapy permits a several-fold increase in drug concentration in the peritoneum compared with systemic administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite this regional advantage, direct penetration into tumor tissue is limited to a few millimeters. This may be enhanced by heating the perfusate containing chemotherapy, but even so, this form of therapy is best restricted to small volume disease.</p><p/><p>Intraperitoneal chemotherapy used in the operating room with hyperthermia has many nomenclatures, including continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion, heated intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy, and HIPEC. The remainder of this topic review will use the term HIPEC. Some centers also extend the period of IP chemotherapy beyond the operating room, an approach termed early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC).</p><p>Good results from <span class=\"nowrap\">CRS/HIPEC</span> can be achieved with optimally selected patient populations and with treatment delivery in a center with expertise in these technically demanding procedures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This approach is best suited for patients with no evidence of extraperitoneal spread, a good performance status, and a disease burden that is amenable to complete cytoreduction to minimal residual disease (no deposits over 2 to 2.5 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is unlikely that even a heated solution of chemotherapy could penetrate large tumor deposits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MPM should be managed at an institution with demonstrated experience in this therapy. The quality of the CRS is dependent upon the skills and level of experience of the surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Even at dedicated treatment centers, major morbidity is experienced by at least 30 percent of patients, the median hospital stay is 12 days, and the operative mortality rate is approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>The favorable results (particularly with regard to treatment-related toxicity) achieved by international experts in the field may not be replicated in routine clinical practice. Guidance as to centers with expertise in treatment of peritoneal mesothelioma is available from the nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.curemeso.org/site/c.kkLUJ7MPKtH/b.3076109/k.FF9C/Mesothelioma_Applied_Research_Foundation.htm&amp;token=Zt/Yffnl8R21eB2KuG8otMPswfrpo8/I75dB12Sl4vRSjClFlIrycxRTJXIa557WmUYQ25xRbj0TgGfw+6kjozLQjVZKpqSIg9JnfWNF7tiJdsn6b0U77+bMHqi+sZvZDr2bg92zg5tze8qfEDJyVw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=82913\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation (MARF)</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135336281\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors are associated with better outcomes after CRS and HIPEC, some of which are useful for stratifying patients into groups that are more or less likely to benefit from this aggressive approach. These include disease extent and depth of tumor invasion beyond the mesothelial surface, completeness of cytoreduction, histology (epithelioid better than sarcomatoid or biphasic), age (less than 60 better than older), and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. Female gender may also be independently associated with a better prognosis, with younger women (&lt;55 years of age) doing better than older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Results from the initial staging computed tomography (CT) scan can be used to predict the likelihood of complete surgical cytoreduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Radiographic imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Sugarbaker's group at the Washington Hospital Center systematically scored findings on preoperative CT scans from 30 patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC for MPM, and identified features associated with adequacy of cytoreduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The presence of a &gt;5 cm mass in the epigastric region and loss of normal architecture of the small bowel and its mesentery (matted adjacent small bowel loops, distorted and thickened configuration, segmental small bowel obstruction, small bowel mesenteric vessels difficult to define due to obliteration of mesenteric fat) were the radiographic features that were most strongly associated with suboptimal cytoreduction. Patients who had neither of these two findings had a 94 percent probability of adequate cytoreduction (defined as all residual tumor nodules &lt;2.5 cm in diameter), while no patient with both findings had a successful surgical cytoreduction.</p><p>Radiographic criteria such as these are one of the selection factors used by Sugarbaker and other groups to select patients with a peritoneal surface malignancy who are most likely to benefit from aggressive surgical debulking and HIPEC. His group uses four preoperative and intraoperative features to select patients for combined treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative contrast (oral and IV)-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis &ndash; In addition to excluding liver or other systemic metastases, the finding of segmental obstruction of the small bowel and tumor nodules &gt;5 cm in diameter on small bowel surfaces or directly adjacent to the small bowel mesentery in the jejunum or upper ileum predict a poor outcome from CRS and HIPEC. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histopathology &ndash; Noninvasive malignancies such as mesothelioma are more likely to be made visibly disease-free through a peritonectomy procedure and are less likely that other invasive histologies (eg, colonic adenocarcinoma) to have spread to regional nodes, liver, or other systemic sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two other clinical indices, the peritoneal cancer index (PCI; a quantitative prognostic indicator derived from the size and distribution of peritoneal surface nodules), and the completeness of cytoreduction score (ie, size of persisting nodules after maximal cytoreduction) are derived intraoperatively.</p><p/><p>Laparoscopy may also be used to predict which patients are likely to have a complete surgical cytoreduction during a subsequent laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135336288\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative procedures that may be used to achieve complete gross cytoreduction include omentectomy, splenectomy, small and large bowel resection, peritonectomy, hysterectomy, salpingectomy, oophorectomy, and low anterior resection. Implants on the serosa of the small bowel, capsule of the liver, or other solid viscera are usually treated by electrical or argon beam coagulation or some other type of electrofulguration.</p><p>HIPEC is done selectively and may be omitted if CRS has been suboptimal. The degree to which surgical cytoreduction versus intraperitoneal chemotherapy contributes to patient outcomes is unclear. The treatment parameters for HIPEC (type of chemotherapy, degree of hyperthermia, and duration of perfusion) vary considerably from one institution to another (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76769\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76769 \">table 2</a>), and there are almost no data to support any specific regimen over another. Two reports suggest that patients treated with intraperitoneal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> via HIPEC may have superior survival compared with those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a>; however, interpretation of these data is limited by their retrospective nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Another study has reported outcomes that are similar to others in 19 patients with MPM (four had progressive benign multicystic mesothelioma) treated with CRS and HIPEC using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The bottom line is that there are no consistent data favoring one type of chemotherapy over another.</p><p>Our approach at the University of Maryland includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After maximal surgical debulking, large bore catheters are placed within the peritoneal cavity and connected to an extracorporeal recirculating perfusion circuit consisting of a reservoir, roller pump, and heat exchanger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four to 6 L of perfusate containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C at a dose of 40 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> are circulated through the peritoneal cavity for 90 minutes.

The median overall survival ranges from 30 to 92 months, and this large range most likely reflects variations between centers with respect to patient selection criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/9,16,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16,32-35</a>]. Despite the absence of randomized controlled trials demonstrating a benefit of CRS and HIPEC, this approach has been accepted as first-line treatment for selected MPM patients who have a good performance status and a disease burden that is amenable to complete (or near complete) cytoreduction. Multiple single institution studies have consistently shown favorable survival with this approach as compared with historical survival data from treatment with systemic chemotherapy alone or in conjunction with palliative surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F95960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95960 \">figure 1</a>). The overall median survival durations for patients treated with CRS and HIPEC were 53 and 38 months in two large multi-center studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/28,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest multi-institutional registry combining retrospective data on patients with MPM treated with CRS and HIPEC at 29 clinical centers worldwide included 405 patients with MPM; a variety of intraperitoneal chemotherapeutic agents were utilized during HIPEC including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The median actuarial overall survival was 53 months with one, three, and five-year survival rates of 81, 60, and 47 percent, respectively. Prognostic factors associated with improved survival on multivariate analysis were epithelioid histologic subtype, absence of lymph node metastases, complete or near complete resection (ie, completeness of cytoreduction score [CC] 0 or 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F95958\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95958 \">table 3</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and the use of HIPEC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second multi-institutional report that included 211 patients treated at three centers in the United States (which were not part of the previous study) showed an actuarial overall survival of 38 months and 5- and 10-year survival rates of 41 and 26 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Although retrospective, the data suggested a better outcome of HIPEC using cisplatin in patients with this disease; interestingly, the benefit was most marked in those who had a CC-0 or 1, and there was no benefit to HIPEC with either agent in patients who had a suboptimal surgical cytoreduction (CC &gt;2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F95958\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95958 \">table 3</a>)).

A number of parameters were associated with a greater risk of shortened survival, including advancing age, male gender, histology (biphasic or sarcomatoid versus epithelioid), and extent of disease. Surgical resection was associated with improved survival overall and survival after surgical resection improved over time. However, 57 percent of individuals diagnosed with MPM during the most recent time interval (2006 to 2010) did not undergo any time of surgical resection, suggesting that many individuals who may be good candidates for surgical resection are not presented with this option.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits of <span class=\"nowrap\">CRS/HIPEC</span> were confirmed in a meta-analysis of 20 publications totaling 1047 patients with MPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Complete or near complete surgical cytoreduction (CC-0 or CC-1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F95958\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95958 \">table 3</a>)) was achieved in 67 percent of patients, and the estimated five-year survival was 42 percent.

In this series, 12 patients (18 percent) required a return to the operating room, the median length of stay was 12 days (range 9 to 18 days), and the 30-day readmission rate was 13 percent. Together, these data highlight the need for a careful risk benefit assessment in each MPM patient being considered for CRS and HIPEC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passot et al have reported a 25-year institutional experience with CRS and HIPEC in 1125 patients with a variety of peritoneal malignancies (84 [8 percent] with MPM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There were some significant trends over the last 10 years of the experience (which included almost 900 patients), such as selection of patients with a lower PCI, an increased proportion of patients undergoing a complete or near complete clinical response, and improved survival. Of note, while operative time and overall complication rates did not change, the operative mortality decreased significantly from 5 to 2 percent over time. These data reflect a general improvement in patient selection and, perhaps, an improvement in perioperative management that has translated into generally better outcomes.

Based on available data, it is reasonable to offer perioperative systemic chemotherapy to patients under certain specific circumstances. For patients in whom the timing of operative CRS and HIPEC must be delayed, we offer a course of systemic chemotherapy until the definitive operation can be performed. After CRS and HIPEC, if high-risk histopathological features are present, such as the presence of deep tissue invasion, then systemic chemotherapy may be administered as consolidation treatment. For patients with optimal cytoreduction and no histopathologic features that would suggest increased risk of early recurrence, no systemic therapy is recommended.</p><p>The utility of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been formally addressed in prospective clinical trials. The following data are available from retrospective analyses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Investigators at NCI Milan reported outcomes in 116 MPM patients, some of whom received neoadjuvant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in addition to HIPEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Although the criteria used to select patients for perioperative chemotherapy were not well defined, there was no association between use of chemotherapy and completeness of cytoreduction, operative morbidity, or survival in the cohort of 60 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy; there was no hint of a survival benefit from the use of postoperative chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, a retrospective review of 126 patients with diffuse MPM treated at one of 20 French centers from 1991 to 2014 with CRS plus HIPEC included cohorts treated with neoadjuvant (n = 42), adjuvant (n = 16), perioperative (n = 16), or no chemotherapy (n = 48); as with the Milan series, the criteria used to select patients for a specific approach were not specified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Contemporary pemetrexed-based regimens were administered in only 62 percent of patients. There was no significant difference in survival between patients receiving no chemotherapy and those receiving either adjuvant alone or perioperative chemotherapy (five-year overall survival 56, 67, and 62 percent, respectively), while patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy had a lower five-year survival rate (40 percent). On multivariate analysis, the sole factor independently associated with better overall survival was the lack of neoadjuvant therapy (hazard ratio 2.2, p = 0.033). Adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.006) and treatment period after 2005 (p = 0.030; after the approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pemetrexed</a>) were associated with an improved progression-free survival on univariate, but not multivariate, analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the limited sample size and retrospective nature of this series, these data should be interpreted cautiously. The authors speculated that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may have been offered more frequently to those patients with more aggressive disease, while patients who had a good response to neoadjuvant treatment may have been more likely to later receive adjuvant chemotherapy and were, thus, included in the perioperative, rather than the neoadjuvant, group. Alternatively, these data may suggest a lower sensitivity to chemotherapy in unresected patients with bulkier disease. The authors also concluded that the longer progression-free survival in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, especially contemporary regimens, suggests that this should be considered to delay recurrence and potentially improve survival.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135336309\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytotoxic chemotherapy is a reasonable option for patients who are not candidates for cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal perfusion with chemotherapy (HIPEC).

Thus, assumptions about the activity of various chemotherapeutic agents for peritoneal mesothelioma are often extrapolated from the more extensive data derived from patients with pleural mesothelioma. Those trials that do permit the enrollment of other mesothelioma disease sites generally include few peritoneal mesothelioma subjects due to the rarity of peritoneal mesothelioma and the standard eligibility requirement for radiologically measurable disease, which can be difficult to determine in the peritoneal cavity. Trials that have been conducted exclusively in patients with peritoneal mesothelioma are quite uncommon. Despite variations in gene expression profiles that suggest different pathophysiology for pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, it is generally assumed (and supported by uncontrolled data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]) that the efficacy of most systemic chemotherapy is similar in both disease sites. </p><p>A meta-analysis of clinical trials reported between 1965 and 2001 determined that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> was the single most active cytotoxic agent against mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-treatment/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Fifty-seven were previously treated, and 38 were chemotherapy-naive.

Median overall survival for previously-treated patients was 13.1 months; it had not been reached at the time of the analysis for chemotherapy-naive patients. As expected, both response rate (29 versus 19 percent) and median survival (13.1 versus 8.7 months) were higher with the pemetrexed doublet than with pemetrexed alone (although the survival outcomes could easily reflect patient selection in this nonrandomized study), and in both cases, the results were comparable to those seen in pleural mesothelioma.

The safety database of 1056 patients did not distinguish between patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, so it is uncertain whether there were any distinct toxicities in the peritoneal subset. The safety analysis in this trial relied on investigator reported serious adverse events, and thus the true rate of toxicity derived from analysis of experience in the Expanded Access Program is likely much greater than reported. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity (primarily anemia) was documented in only 2 percent of patients and neutropenia, in less than 1 percent.

As with mesothelioma arising in other sites, there is a strong relationship between asbestos exposure and the development of MPM, particularly in men. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The majority of cases of MPM present with diffuse peritoneal involvement (diffuse MPM). Morbidity and mortality are almost entirely due to disease progression within the peritoneum and not distant metastatic spread. Because the peritoneal implants are superficial and do not invade the underlying tissues deeply until the late stages, the disease is amenable to complete or near complete cytoreduction in over one-half of all patients undergoing exploration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-peritoneal-mesothelioma-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and imaging features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For selected patients with diffuse MPM, no extraperitoneal disease spread, a good performance status, and who can be predicted to achieve complete surgical cytoreduction, we recommend regional therapy using cytoreduction surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal perfusion with chemotherapy (HIPEC) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). At the University of Maryland, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H135336274\" class=\"local\">'Cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although randomized trials have not been conducted, as the number of centers utilizing this approach has expanded, particularly over the last five years, marked improvements in outcome have been reported compared with historical controls. Among centers with expertise in this form of therapy, reported median survival approaches five years. Referral of these patients to a center with expertise in the management of MPM is preferred. (See <a href=\"#H135336295\" class=\"local\">'Results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of systemic chemotherapy in conjunction with CRS plus HIPEC is uncertain, and its use should be individualized. For patients in whom the timing of operative CRS and HIPEC must be delayed, we offer a course of systemic chemotherapy until the definitive operation can be performed. After CRS and HIPEC, if high risk histopathological features are present, such as the presence of deep tissue invasion, then systemic chemotherapy may be administered as consolidation treatment. For patients with optimal cytoreduction and no histopathologic features that would suggest increased risk of early recurrence, no systemic therapy is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H109023551\" class=\"local\">'Contribution of systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytotoxic chemotherapy is a reasonable option for patients who are not candidates for CRS and HIPEC. Initial systemic therapy is also a reasonable approach for men over the age of 60 years with peritoneal mesothelioma, given the more aggressive nature and worse outcomes in this population. CRS with HIPEC could then be offered to those who respond and remain reasonable candidates for the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest initial surgical resection alone rather than CRS and HIPEC for patients with the indolent well-differentiated peritoneal mesothelioma and multicystic mesothelioma variants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Long-term follow-up is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H135336351\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal mesothelioma variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving systemic therapy, we suggest a pemetrexed-containing regimen over other chemotherapy options (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pemetrexed</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> is an active regimen if the patient's performance status and general health are adequate to tolerate it. Particularly in the palliative setting, pemetrexed plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> is a very reasonable option that achieves similar results with less toxicity. Another reasonable option for appropriately selected patients is the combination of pemetrexed plus a platinum agent and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>. (See <a href=\"#H135336316\" class=\"local\">'Pemetrexed plus cisplatin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the chemotherapy regimen includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pemetrexed</a>, concurrent supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> is needed to reduce toxicity.
