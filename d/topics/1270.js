While the cause may be evident after straightforward history-taking, often no cause is immediately apparent. In these cases, clinicians face the challenge of determining a thoughtful, cost-effective, yet comprehensive evaluation.</p><p>The definition and epidemiology of night sweats, differential diagnosis, approach to history-taking and physical examination, and suggested evaluation of the patient with night sweats are discussed here. The management of benign excessive sweating (idiopathic hyperhidrosis) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-focal-hyperhidrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary focal hyperhidrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Night sweats must be distinguished from other disorders of sweating. For the purposes of this discussion, night sweats are drenching sweats that require changing bedclothes. This more strict definition excludes patients with a benign increase in sweating, or hyperhidrosis. An overheated room or too many bed coverings may be a simple cause for an increase in sweating at night.</p><p>Hot flashes are often difficult to distinguish from night sweats, although the former have several distinctive features. Hot flashes may begin with an unpleasant sensation in the chest, breasts, or abdomen. A sudden warmth and visible skin redness in the chest, head, and neck follows, which may be apparent to observers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The warmth lasts for three to four minutes and is followed by sweating in the same areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Flushing, a feature of carcinoid and an adverse effect of certain medications, is a warmth and redness of the face and occasionally the trunk. In practice, it may be difficult to distinguish flushing or increased sweating from night sweats. Thus, the conditions associated with any of these symptoms are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few series of patients with night sweats exist in the literature. Several small series have reported descriptive epidemiology and the ultimate diagnoses of patients with night sweats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. These series are limited by selection bias, lack of standardization of evaluation, and variable follow-up.</p><p>In the largest study examining the prevalence of night sweats in ambulatory patients presenting to primary care clinicians, 41 percent of the 2267 participating patients reported experiencing night sweats within the last month, including 23 percent with pure night sweats only and 18 percent with both day and night sweats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A night sweat in this study was defined as &quot;sweating at night even when it isn't excessively hot in your bedroom.&quot; In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with pure night sweats were hot flashes and panic attacks in women and sleep problems in men. However, the study was not designed to establish the true causes of night sweats.</p><p>In a second report, a random sample of 174 inpatients on medical, surgical, obstetric, and gynecologic services were asked whether they had had night sweats in the previous three months; a standardized questionnaire was given to all those with positive responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thirty-two percent of non-obstetric patients and 60 percent of obstetric patients reported a history of night sweats. Only 11 percent of all patients reported severe night sweats (bath or clothing change required). Obstetric patients, who presumably were otherwise healthy, had the highest frequency of night sweats. Underlying disease did not predict the likelihood of night sweats, although there were few patients included who had those diseases known to be associated with night sweats. The authors did not follow their subjects after hospital discharge to learn of subsequent diagnoses.</p><p>In a third study conducted in 100 hospice patients with cancer, 16 voluntarily reported sweating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The sweating was predominantly at night in one-half of these patients. In this highly selected population, no clinical factors predicted night sweats. Sweating did not correlate with tumor type, pain, or medication use.</p><p>The only study that specifically addressed the causes of night sweats in an ambulatory population interviewed 200 sequential patients in an office practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Seventy percent of these patients were from a primary care practice; the remainder were from a gastroenterology specialty practice. Eighty-one patients reported at least one night sweat within the previous year. A subsequent chart review determined the cause to be gastroesophageal reflux in 36 patients, menopause in 21, external overheating in 14, multifactorial in 6, and unknown in 4. Eighty percent of the 24 patients with frequent night sweats reported symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. In the 12 patients with night sweats and gastroesophageal reflux for whom results of treatment were available, all had relief of night sweats with treatment of the reflux. However, it may not be easy to generalize these results due to the variable follow-up, imprecise diagnostic categories, lack of a clear definition, and referral bias.</p><p>One study suggested that night sweats do not portend a poor prognosis. In a cohort study of 1534 patients &gt;65 years old attending a geriatric primary care clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], patients who reported night sweats at baseline were no more likely to die over seven years of follow-up than those without night sweats. This finding does not diminish the importance or need for a careful evaluation of patients with night sweats. However, it does suggest that at least a subset of patients that defy a specific diagnosis, and who do not develop any other localizing symptoms over time to suggest a specific diagnosis, may have a benign course in follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of night sweats is large. The available literature consists primarily of case series and symptom surveys of collected patients with a particular diagnosis. Broad categories include malignancy, infection, medications, endocrine causes, neurologic disease, menopause, and idiopathic hyperhidrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58031\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58031 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Night sweats may be an early feature of many different cancers. Malignancy should always be considered in the evaluation of a patient with night sweats.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The malignancy most commonly associated with night sweats is lymphoma; low-grade fever and drenching night sweats are found in approximately 25 percent of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Night sweats is one of the &quot;B&quot; symptoms in the commonly used Cotswolds staging classification for Hodgkin lymphoma; the others are significant fever and unintentional loss of at least 10 percent of body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Night sweats by themselves, in contrast to the other B symptoms, do not appear to adversely affect the prognosis of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>Additional symptoms that may suggest Hodgkin lymphoma as the cause for night sweats include fatigue, pruritus, and pain (at sites of tumor involvement) after alcohol consumption. The physical examination may be normal or may reveal lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults#H78183315\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;, section on 'B symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma may also report night sweats as an early constitutional symptom. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Systemic complaints (B symptoms)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Solid tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nonhematologic malignancies may also experience night sweats. Reports exist of night sweats among patients with most types of solid tumors. Common malignancies include prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, and germ cell tumors. Advanced medullary carcinoma of the thyroid may cause flushing due to calcitonin secretion. Insulinoma may cause night sweats because of nocturnal hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic and indolent infections often cause night sweats. While other typical clinical features are usually present, in some cases night sweats are the sole initial symptom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disease most commonly associated with night sweats in medical lore is tuberculosis. In contrast to many other etiologies of night sweats, large case series exist that cite the frequency of clinical features of tuberculosis. In one prospective study of 313 adults with confirmed cases of tuberculosis, 48 percent of patients reported sweats; 29 percent of patients had sweats of at least two weeks in duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Sweats were more common among patients with extrapulmonary disease than among those with pulmonary disease (54 versus 46 percent). Cough, fatigue, and fever were each more common than sweats and occurred in 73, 60, and 52 percent of patients, respectively. Other symptoms occurring less often than sweats included weight loss, anorexia, chest pain, diarrhea, and hemoptysis. In another retrospective study of clinical features of tuberculosis in 372 patients, night sweats occurred in 46 percent of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis compared with 24 percent of those with extrapulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and complications of pulmonary tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These results were similar to the finding of night sweats in 62 percent of 5480 inpatients with active pulmonary or pleural tuberculosis in a second report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Only cough, anorexia or weight loss, and sputum were more common than night sweats in this report. In another study, night sweats in patients with tuberculosis were more common among patients under age 60 years than among older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This was the only feature that was more common in younger patients.</p><p>While night sweats are sensitive, they are not specific for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. This was illustrated in a study comparing the clinical features in 101 patients with suspected tuberculosis who ultimately did or did not have the disease after evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While cough and sputum each predicted tuberculosis, no difference existed in the incidence of night sweats between patients with and without tuberculosis. However, only one patient with tuberculosis had no weight loss, cough, or sputum. Even among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, who may be expected to have more baseline constitutional symptoms than non-HIV-infected individuals, night sweats remain an independent predictor of tuberculosis among patients suspected of having the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Night sweats appear to be less common among patients with culture proven tuberculosis who are smear-negative (three negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli). In a study that included 52 such patients, only 33 percent reported night sweats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Brucellosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that mainly affects people who work with domestic animals or animal products, or people whose diet includes raw milk or unpasteurized cheese. Four <em>Brucella</em> species are pathogenic to humans: <em>Brucella melitensis</em>, <em>B. abortus</em>, <em>B. suis</em>, and <em>B. canis</em>. Brucellosis is a well-documented cause of fever of unknown origin with varied and nonspecific symptoms. Common clinical symptoms include night sweats and joint pains; other prominent symptoms are malaise, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, malodorous perspiration, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Multiple organ systems (liver, heart, central nervous system) may also be involved. The onset of symptoms of brucellosis may be abrupt or insidious, developing over several days to weeks.</p><p>There are few objective findings, other than fever. Physical findings, when present, are usually limited to minimal lymphadenopathy and occasionally hepatosplenomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of brucellosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacterial infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subacute bacterial infections may lead to night sweats. Most common are endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and pyogenic abscess. Fever will also be present in many of these instances. Localizing symptoms or signs can also suggest one of these diagnoses. As an example, back pain and a new heart murmur may suggest endocarditis; localized mouth pain raises the possibility of a dental abscess. Thus, patients with these diagnoses less often have &quot;night sweats of unknown origin&quot; than those with other diagnoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection often experience night sweats. One group studied constitutional symptoms among 205 patients with HIV infection and at least one of fever, diarrhea, or weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this highly selected cohort, 70 percent of patients experienced night sweats; the mean frequency was once per week. Patients with acute exposure to HIV and seroconversion may also report night sweats; the incidence was 9 percent in two separate studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, fever, lymphadenopathy, and joint pain were each more common in newly HIV-infected individuals than night sweats.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications are a common cause of increased sweating or frank night sweats. The exact incidence cannot be determined given the lack of published epidemiologic data, although medications are a frequent cause of night sweats when the etiology is not immediately apparent after clinical evaluation. The mechanism by which sweats develop differs across drug classes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The list of medications known to cause increased sweating or flushing is extensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56351 \">table 2</a>). In an individual patient, it may be difficult to confidently distinguish between flushing, increased sweating, and night sweats. The listed medications, therefore, include those that may cause any of these side effects. The evaluation of a patient with night sweats is not complete without a careful history of all prescribed and over-the-counter medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antidepressants are perhaps the most common medication-related cause of sweating, which occurs in approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These medications cause a generalized increase in sweating, but some patients may be more aware of episodes at night and seek medical attention for night sweats. Sweating usually occurs within several weeks of initiation of antidepressants.</p><p>All antidepressants have been implicated, including tricyclic drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the newer agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>. Tricyclic drugs, bupropion, and venlafaxine cause sweating more frequently than SSRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Sweating is the most common side effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other psychiatric medications that have been implicated include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Antipyretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any medicine that lowers body temperature may cause sweats. Clinicians should inquire about a history of frequent use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication as these over-the-counter medications can occasionally cause sweating episodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholinergic agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholinergic agonists cause sweating through direct stimulation of peripheral muscarinic receptors in the sweat glands. Though not used as commonly as in the past, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bethanechol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bethanechol</a> are two examples of cholinergic agents in clinical practice. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as organophosphate pesticides, cause prominent sweating after accidental poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypoglycemic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally sweats are the most prominent clinical feature of hypoglycemia. While other typical symptoms of hypoglycemia are usually present, clinicians should still consider the possibility of medication-induced hypoglycemia in insulin or sulfonylurea-treated patients with diabetes who report nocturnal episodes of sweating.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Hormonal agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All medications that modulate estrogen or androgen levels, or receptor binding, have the potential to cause night sweats. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists induce a state of hypogonadism when used chronically in the treatment of men (eg, for prostate cancer) or women (eg, for endometriosis). This pharmacologic castrate state commonly produces hot flashes. Aromatase inhibitors cause hot flashes by decreasing the conversion of androgens to estrogens, resulting in a fall in circulating estrogen levels.</p><p>Hot flashes are the most common side effect of the antiestrogenic drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, affecting 64 percent of treated patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Raloxifene</a>, another selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), causes hot flashes in 10 to 25 percent of patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flutamide</a>, an androgen receptor blocker, causes hot flashes in men treated for prostate cancer.

In a series of 108 pheochromocytomas in 104 patients, sweating was present in 37 percent of patients and flushing in 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Hypertension, headache, and palpitations were each more common, with a prevalence of 82, 58, and 48 percent, respectively. In a single institution review of 95 patients, sweating was similarly present in 52 percent of patients; 88 percent of affected patients were hypertensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Clinicians should consider this diagnosis when sweating spells or night sweats occur in a hypertensive patient with other typical features of pheochromocytoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Carcinoid syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flushing is the hallmark of the carcinoid syndrome, occurring in 84 percent of affected patients. Other classic symptoms are diarrhea and wheezing. Right-sided cardiac valvular disease occurs in up to one-half of patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;</a>). Flushing rarely occurs alone. Diarrhea occurs in 70 percent of patients, and only 5 percent of patients experience flushing without diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This suggests that clinicians may defer evaluation for possible carcinoid as an initial diagnostic strategy when flushing occurs as an isolated symptom.</p><p>Patients with intestinal carcinoids do not develop the carcinoid syndrome unless liver metastases are present.

In one review, sweating occurred in 50 to 91 percent of patients, and heat intolerance in 41 to 89 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The sweating is usually persistent and is not paroxysmal. In most patients, other clinical features of hyperthyroidism will alert the clinician to this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic conditions that may cause increased sweating and potentially night sweats include autonomic dysreflexia, posttraumatic syringomyelia, stroke, and autonomic neuropathy. While no good epidemiologic data exist, these are likely considerably less common causes of night sweats in a primary care setting than the diagnoses already discussed.</p><p>Autonomic dysreflexia is a syndrome of acute autonomic instability that occurs in patients with cervical or high thoracic spinal cord injuries above the T8 level. The most common precipitant is bladder distension; it may also occur after rectal distension, urologic or rectal procedures, or any painful stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Common clinical features include sweating of the forehead or generalized sweating along with headache, gooseflesh, cutaneous vasodilation, increased muscle spasticity, an acute rise in blood pressure, and a desire to void. This distinctive constellation, in the context of a patient with a spinal cord injury, is not easily confused with other causes of sweating spells. Other authors have reported the differential diagnosis to include migraine, cluster headache, primary hypertension, posterior fossa tumors, pheochromocytoma, and toxemia of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Posttraumatic or idiopathic syringomyelia can cause spells of generalized increase in sweating. The sweating may be affected by posture and may be generalized or segmental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>A unilateral increase in sweating can occur after acute hemispheric brain infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and segmental hyperhidrosis may result from a spinal or paraspinal lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distinction between perimenopausal hot flashes and night sweats is not always clear. As an example, in a recall questionnaire study of postmenopausal women, 35 percent of subjects recalled night sweats due to menopause while 74 percent recalled hot flashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Similarly, in a large questionnaire study of United States women (n = 14,906), the number of women who reported night sweats due to menopause was nearly equal to the number of those who reported hot flashes (23.6 percent versus 27.5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Daily alcohol use increases the likelihood of hot flashes and night sweats in perimenopausal women, compared with women who drink &le;one drink a month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Prior hysterectomy, depressed mood, and anxiety also correlated with the likelihood of experiencing hot flashes in another large cross-sectional study of women aged 54 to 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The median age of menopause in the United States is 51 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The first menopausal symptoms, usually hot flashes, occur a median of 3.8 years earlier and often precede a change in the menstrual pattern. The peak occurrence is during the year before the final menstrual period, although women may experience hot flashes for more than 10 years after menopause (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>). Clinicians should also consider the possibility of hot flashes in younger women after bilateral oophorectomy or chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.</p><p>Clinicians should not immediately conclude that sweating or flushing episodes in women of typical perimenopausal age are hot flashes. If atypical or localizing symptoms are present, one should obtain a more complete history, perform a directed physical examination, and consider further study before assigning the symptoms to menopause. Similarly, based upon the epidemiology of menopause, other diagnostic possibilities should be entertained if flushing occurs in a woman with normal menstrual cycles before the age of 45.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic hyperhidrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic hyperhidrosis is a benign increase in eccrine sweating without pathologic cause (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-focal-hyperhidrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary focal hyperhidrosis&quot;</a>). One percent of the general population experiences excessive sweating beyond that needed to cool the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Anxiety may precipitate episodes. Generalized hyperhidrosis is episodic. It may be either localized or generalized and usually involves the palms, soles, and axillae. The consequences of this condition primarily involve social embarrassment. Its importance in this discussion is to differentiate this benign increase in sweating from pathologic causes of night sweats or flushing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4204654\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, night sweats disrupt sleep. Sleep disorders are more common among patients with night sweats, though it is unclear if sleep disorders are a cause of night sweats or if sleep disorders are reported more commonly in patients who awaken because of night sweats. In a cross-sectional study of 363 patients attending a clinician office visit, 24 percent of patients experienced night sweats in the previous month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Significant predictors of night sweats included daytime tiredness (odds ratio [OR] 1.99, CI 1.12-3.53), legs jerking during sleep (OR 1.78, CI 1.05-3.00), and awakening with pain (OR 1.87, CI 1.16-2.99). In another study evaluating night sweats in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, 30.6 percent of men and 33.3 percent of women reported night sweats at least three times a week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The prevalence of night sweats decreased with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment (from 33.2 to 11.5 percent).</p><p>One chart review study evaluated 282 sequential patients who had undergone formal polysomnography, most of whom were referred for suspected sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Night sweats were reported in 28 percent of patients. There was discordance between patient-reported symptoms and the findings on polysomnography. Patients who reported night sweats were more likely to also report breathing trouble at night, daytime fatigue, snoring, morning headaches, and kicking during sleep. However, there was no difference in the apnea hypopnea index (API), sleep-onset latency, or total sleep time when compared with patients without night sweats.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4204711\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscellaneous causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other less common diagnoses may result in night sweats. The association between night sweats, increased sweating, or flushing and these diagnoses is less well established. Gastroesophageal reflux can cause night sweats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Case reports exist of temporal arteritis, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] diabetes insipidus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] as causes for night sweats. Night sweats occur in 30 to 40 percent of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), but other clinical features predominate in this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Men whose prostate cancer has been treated with orchiectomy will usually experience hypogonadal hot flashes.</p><p>Flushing is a common feature of the systemic mastocytosis syndrome. Common blushing is not easily confused with night sweats. Facial flushing is a feature of rosacea; this does not commonly occur at night. Food additives may cause flushing in some patients. Gustatory sweating is facial sweating after food or drink. It may occur in patients with diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], after parotidectomy, parotid trauma, or neck dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Clinicians would be unlikely to confuse this with night sweats.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the extensive list of possible causes of night sweats, the challenge for clinicians is to correctly identify patients with a serious cause while minimizing unnecessary diagnostic evaluations that are costly and may carry some risk for the patient. It is not possible to construct an evidence-based approach based upon the available literature. Published recommendations for the approach to patients with night sweats have been mostly experiential and opinion. The few epidemiologic surveys are subject to selection bias, and no comprehensive studies report the frequency of the ultimate diagnosis among unselected series of patients with night sweats.</p><p>Thus, the ideal approach is a matter of opinion, and reasonable clinicians may reach different conclusions. The following approach takes into account the likelihood of certain conditions in a primary care setting, the diagnostic value of associated symptoms, the benefit of physical examination in suggesting a cause, and the tradeoff between delay of diagnosis with a conservative approach versus the cost and risk of diagnostic evaluations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history is the most important element in the evaluation of a patient with night sweats. It is unlikely that further evaluation will prove fruitful if no cause is apparent after taking a complete history. A rational approach to taking a history follows from the potential diagnoses outlined above.</p><p>First, it is particularly important for clinicians to exclude fever with certainty when evaluating patients with night sweats. The presence of fever greatly expands the diagnostic possibilities. When doubt exists, patients should keep a diary and take their temperature during and after a sweat to exclude fever more thoroughly. If present, the cause for fever must be determined.</p><p>Associated symptoms that make a particular cause more likely should be sought. These include unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and pruritus that may suggest lymphoma. Localized pain may suggest cancer, abscess, or osteomyelitis. Back pain and fever suggest endocarditis or localized infection in the epidural space or vertebral body. Frank rigors favor a bacterial infection.</p><p>Risk factors for tuberculosis include a prior positive diagnostic test (tuberculosis skin test [TST] or interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hemodialysis, gastrectomy, solid organ transplantation, exposure to an individual with tuberculosis, being homeless or living in an institutionalized setting, immigration from an endemic area, or working in a healthcare setting. Cough, sputum, fatigue, and weight loss also suggest this diagnosis.</p><p>The American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement on targeted tuberculin testing and the treatment of latent tuberculosis, as well as other ATS guidelines, can be accessed through the ATS <a href=\"http://www.thoracic.org/statements/&amp;token=qarzLAn4JdAbZ323FG1scHYDG28iQPBGI48zV/nNgikyfVut82/f14D/ERhZjGMy&amp;TOPIC_ID=2768\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p>We also ask about other risk factors for HIV infection, including injection drug use, men who have sex with men, and sexual activity with multiple partners or commercial sex workers. Other suggestive historical features include thrush, diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, or a patient report of enlarged lymph nodes.</p><p>The medication history should include both prescription and over-the-counter medications, with attention toward the use of any medication known to cause sweating or flushing as detailed above. Medication-induced sweating is usually a diagnosis of exclusion once other causes appear unlikely after obtaining a directed history. A temporal relationship between the initiation of a new medication and the onset of sweating increases the likelihood of the medication as the cause.</p><p>Flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, palpitations, headache, heat intolerance, skin changes, and tremor may suggest an endocrine cause. The presence of a spinal cord injury, recent stroke, or regional or segmental sweating will suggest a possible neurologic cause. Characteristic hot flashes should be distinguished from less specific night sweats in a woman of perimenopausal age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should be thorough unless the cause is certain after taking the patient's history. One should measure temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and weight. The skin examination should include attention to the sweating pattern, flushing, peripheral stigmata of endocarditis, and changes of hyperthyroidism. All lymph node chains should be examined in search of any pathologically enlarged nodes; an abnormal lymph node should be evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in adults&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Lid lag or exophthalmos may suggest hyperthyroidism. One should exclude thrush in the oropharynx and evaluate for a goiter or thyroid nodule. The chest examination may rarely reveal findings suggestive of tuberculous pneumonia; a new or changed murmur may suggest endocarditis. The abdomen should be assessed for splenomegaly that may suggest lymphoma. Clinicians should seek evidence for myelopathy or dermatomal sensory abnormalities if a neurologic cause is suggested by the history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment should be directed at the presumed cause if one is apparent after a complete history and physical examination. If a patient is taking a medication known to cause flushing or excessive sweating, the medication should be withdrawn, if possible, as a diagnostic trial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58031\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58031 \">table 1</a>). If this is not possible, a change to a lower dose, an extended-release formulation of the medication, or a drug less likely to cause sweating is another potential strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>If no cause is found, the patient should keep a daily diary of temperature readings at random times and during and after a sweating episode. Once fever is excluded, the next strategy depends upon the character of the sweating episodes. If the history is one of mild focal increases in sweating, clinicians may establish a tentative diagnosis of idiopathic hyperhidrosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-focal-hyperhidrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary focal hyperhidrosis&quot;</a>). Other than for symptom control, these patients require no additional treatment or evaluation. They should be counseled to report any fever, change in their sweating pattern, or new symptoms that might suggest an additional diagnosis.</p><p>Further evaluation is warranted if the history is that of drenching night sweats that require changing bedclothes. A chest radiograph in conjunction with a TST or IGRA are appropriate for all such patients as an initial evaluation for possible tuberculosis, in addition to a complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), HIV serology, and blood cultures. If these are normal, and drenching night sweats persist, clinicians should obtain a torso computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for lymphoma, solid tumor, or abscess. If no diagnosis is apparent and severe night sweats persist, additional evaluation may include a bone marrow biopsy.</p><p>Menopause and the endocrine causes of night sweats are sufficiently characteristic that, in general, clinicians may limit directed evaluations for these diagnoses to patients with flushing or increased sweating and typical associated clinical features. When night sweats remain a puzzle, a broad diagnostic approach including a 24-hour urine collection for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), metanephrine, and catecholamines is reasonable, in addition to a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement for women who may be menopausal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At each step of this evaluation, it is important to repeat a careful history as new diagnostic symptoms often emerge over time.
