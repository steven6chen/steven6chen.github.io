Many patients requiring such procedures have severe cardiovascular disease or pulmonary comorbidity; thus, they are at high risk for oversedation and hemodynamic instability. Even relatively healthy patients may not tolerate remaining motionless during prolonged or painful interventional procedures. For these reasons, the number of cases that require monitored anesthesia care (MAC) or general anesthesia in these off-site settings has increased (eg, &gt;50 percent of EP cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthetic-considerations-for-electrophysiology-interventional-cardiology-and-transesophageal-echocardiography-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]). Given the special considerations and growing need, some institutions have a subspecialized anesthesia team dedicated to these settings.</p><p>This topic will review anesthetic management of adult patients undergoing procedures in EP, interventional cardiology, and TEE suites. Anesthetic considerations in other off-site settings (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography [CT], gastrointestinal endoscopy) are reviewed in other topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036385040\"><span class=\"h1\">PREANESTHESIA PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple factors affect the selection<strong> </strong>of anesthetic technique, dosing of anesthetic and adjuvant agents, and whether invasive monitoring will be employed for electrophysiology (EP), interventional cardiology, or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) procedures. Unique patient- or procedure-related considerations are discussed in advance with members of the interventional team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthetic-considerations-for-electrophysiology-interventional-cardiology-and-transesophageal-echocardiography-procedures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Challenges for anesthesiologists in such off-site locations often include lack of standard anesthesia machines, monitors, supplies, or scavenging equipment for anesthetic gases. Additional time is required for transport of necessary items from a distant OR location, and subsequent setup and positioning of all equipment in the off-site location. Ensuring availability of well-located portable shields, lead aprons, thyroid collars, and eye protection for all anesthesia personnel is necessary for procedures with radiation risks. Another challenge is interdisciplinary communication, which may be hindered by lack of familiarity with the procedures and techniques planned by each specialist. Further discussion of challenges in remote locations is available elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Timing of the most recent doses of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications is particularly important, since these agents increase risk for bleeding during EP and interventional procedures. However, many patients undergoing EP procedures require ongoing anticoagulation to prevent periprocedural thrombus formation, similar to patients undergoing cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Outpatients should receive instructions for periprocedural anticoagulant dosing from the interventional team. These instructions vary depending on the planned procedure, patient specific factors, and institutional preferences. If there is uncertainty about the patient&rsquo;s anticoagulation status when <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> arrives for the procedure, coagulation tests are obtained (eg, prothrombin time [PT] and international normalized ratio [INR]) to determine whether the procedure should be rescheduled.</p><p>Antiarrhythmic medications that affect atrioventricular (AV) node conduction (eg, calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 4</a>)) are typically discontinued several days prior to a scheduled invasive EP procedure; however, beta blockers may be gradually tapered. Patients should receive specific instructions from the EP team regarding their antiarrhythmic medications and are queried about the timing of their most recent doses shortly before the procedure. Discussion with the electrophysiologist is necessary when there is uncertainty regarding these instructions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the patient&rsquo;s compliance.

For example, deep sedation with monitored anesthesia care (MAC) may be selected in patients with severe anxiety, inability to lie supine, morbid obesity, a difficult airway, or significant cardiovascular disease or comorbidities. General anesthesia may be requested by the interventional team if the planned procedure would be compromised by patient movement, is likely to be prolonged, or if endotracheal intubation is necessary due to limited airway access or presence of a TEE probe during the procedure. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2806569147\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During administration of sedatives, opioids, or other anesthetic agents for monitored anesthesia care (MAC) or general anesthesia, monitoring always includes standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors, with pulse oximetry and capnography to ensure that hypoxia or apnea is avoided.

If intracardiac thrombus is detected, the procedure is cancelled and rescheduled. For this reason, if suspicion for thrombus is high, TEE may be performed the day before the procedure or prior to induction of general anesthesia. If a TEE examination is to be performed immediately after induction, short-acting anesthetics and NMBAs are selected, so that rapid awakening can be achieved if thrombus is detected.</p><p>After removal of the TEE probe, an esophageal temperature probe is inserted orally. Insertion of the temperature probe via the nasal route is avoided, particularly if the patient received a recent dose of an anticoagulant agent, due to the possibility of significant nasal bleeding. In selected cases, the electrophysiologist will subsequently direct precise positioning of the esophageal probe using fluoroscopy to facilitate optimal monitoring of esophageal temperature (eg, to avoid thermal injury during radiofrequency ablation in the posterior LA near the esophagus).

The electrophysiologist uses radiographic imaging to identify the esophageal temperature probe and assist the anesthesiologist in positioning it in the esophagus directly behind the myocardial foci targeted for ablation. During active ablation, the anesthesiologist and electrophysiologist continuously monitor esophageal temperature to avoid burn injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Saline flushing via the ablation catheter is employed by the electrophysiologist to cool the myocardium throughout an RFA procedure. Since several liters of fluid may be administered by such flushing, the anesthesiologist needs to minimize IV fluid administration and calculate total fluid balance at frequent intervals (eg, every 30 minutes). If fluid overload is suspected, an intraoperative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> 20 mg IV may be administered to achieve diuresis. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cryoballoon ablation</strong> <strong>(CBA)</strong> &mdash; Cryothermal energy freezes myocardial tissue by insertion of a balloon-based catheter into each individual pulmonary vein; this catheter can expand and freeze the surrounding tissue.

High-risk cases (eg, transvenous lead extraction, ICD leads older than five years, or pacing leads older than 10 years) are typically performed in a hybrid OR with dedicated fluoroscopy, participation of a cardiothoracic surgeon, and general anesthesia. Invasive intra-arterial pressure monitoring and large bore IV access (eg, a femoral vein) is often employed during such high-risk cases, and some centers use TEE monitoring to immediately detect major complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthetic-considerations-for-electrophysiology-interventional-cardiology-and-transesophageal-echocardiography-procedures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H818848506\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anesthetic goal for cardioversion is to provide deep sedation with loss of consciousness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99795\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99795 \">table 5</a>), which should last for only the few seconds required for one or two cardioversion attempts, while avoiding apnea and the need for assisted ventilation.</p><p>In some cases, a TEE examination is performed prior to cardioversion (eg, history of inadequate anticoagulation conferring an increased risk of intracardiac thrombus and embolic stroke).
