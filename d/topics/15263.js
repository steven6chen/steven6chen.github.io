Some clinicians believe that allergic responses to aeroallergens are a rare cause of exacerbations of AD and that food allergy is generally not a factor. Other clinicians believe that allergy plays a strong role in exacerbating AD in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They believe that food allergies trigger symptoms primarily in young children and environmental allergens play a greater role in older children and adults.</p><p>Despite its name, AD itself is not a type I allergy, nor is it necessarily associated with allergic sensitization. However, overall, the data indicate that allergy plays a role in selected patients with AD.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of AD, as well as the role of delayed-type hypersensitivity to chemicals in topical medications and skin care products in exacerbating AD, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ATOPIC ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AD have higher rates of allergic diseases than the general population. Up to 80 percent of children with AD develop asthma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allergic rhinitis later in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This progression from AD in infancy to allergic rhinitis and asthma in childhood and young adulthood is referred to as the &quot;allergic march&quot; or &quot;atopic march&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>The converse is true as well. A higher rate of AD is seen in teenagers with asthma than those without asthma (risk ratio [RR] 4.5, 95% CI 3.1-6.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Ten to 20 percent of patients with AD have food-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/anaphylaxis</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] compared with 1 to 3 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In infants with eczema, the prevalence of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), except in patients with a history of anaphylaxis and positive specific IgE, ranges from 33 to 63 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/8,12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12-16</a>]. Earlier onset (&lt;3 months of age) and more severe AD is associated with high egg, milk, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peanut-specific IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with AD and concomitant egg, peanut, or dust mite allergy are more likely to have AD that persists beyond five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>AD is also associated with elevated serum IgE. A high total serum IgE level is a strong risk factor for AD in children from birth to six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) variants are associated with slightly higher total IgE levels and sensitization to food allergens, most commonly hen's egg, in young children with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In adults, elevated total IgE is associated with persistent eczema with a wide distribution after 10 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLERGEN SENSITIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies have demonstrated an increased rate of sensitization to both food and aeroallergens in patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. On average, 50 percent of children and 35 percent of adults with AD are sensitized to common allergens. However, these proportions vary widely (7 to 78 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Evidence of allergen sensitization is not proof of clinically relevant allergy. Confirming clinical reactivity is especially important when food allergies are suspected in young children since avoidance of food allergens can put growing children at nutritional risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Food allergies'</a> below.)</p><p>Infants and young children with AD are more commonly sensitized to foods (wheat and egg sensitization are most prevalent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Children over five years and adults are more commonly sensitized to aeroallergens (dust mite sensitization is most prevalent in both children and adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A higher rate of dust mite sensitization in patients with AD is also seen with atopy patch testing (APT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Several studies have compared allergic sensitization patterns in patients with AD from different countries. The findings demonstrate a wide variability in sensitization patterns between countries and confirm that allergic sensitization is associated with higher socioeconomic status:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), 28,591 children aged 8 to 12 years from 20 countries were examined for flexural eczema and skin tested to at least six common aeroallergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The point prevalence of AD ranged from &lt;1 to 14 percent. The percentage of children who had at least one positive skin prick test ranged from 0 to 74 percent. The association of AD and allergic sensitization was stronger in affluent versus nonaffluent countries (odds ratio [OR] 2.69, 95% CI 2.31-3.12 versus 1.17, 0.81-1.70).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were seen in a study of five- to six-year-old children with AD and allergic sensitization in East and West Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Only 36 percent of children with AD in East Germany were skin prick test positive to at least one food or inhalant allergen compared with 50 percent of children with AD in West Germany.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized early prevention trial for asthma, baseline evaluation of 2184 infants with AD from atopic families included total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE to eight food and inhalant allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A total of 53 percent of infants had IgE &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kU/L,</span> with the percentage ranging from 35 to 67 percent in 12 different countries. Ninety-six percent of the infants had complete specific IgE results. Over half of these infants were sensitized (specific IgE &ge; 0.70 <span class=\"nowrap\">kU/L);</span> 19 percent, monosensitized; and 37 percent, polysensitized. Nearly one-half were sensitized to at least one food, and one-third were sensitized to one or more inhalant allergens (egg white, 42 percent; cow's milk, 27 percent; peanut, 24 percent; house dust mite, 21 percent; cat dander, 13 percent; tree pollen, 8 percent; grass pollen, 8 percent; and <em>Alternaria</em>, 4 percent). Rates of specific allergen sensitization varied widely between countries. As an example, the rate of egg white sensitization was 54 percent in Australia and 23 percent in Belgium.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOD ALLERGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of dermatologic manifestations are believed to be associated with food allergies: <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/anaphylaxis</span> and food-exacerbated AD. Only the second type of reaction is examined here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset urticaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In food-exacerbated AD reactions, ingestion of the food acutely is thought to cause a flare of the patient's AD (increased erythema and pruritus of eczematous lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The flare occurs within minutes to a few hours if the reaction is immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated but may take hours to days if the reaction is non-IgE mediated. The patient has persistent lesions if the food is eaten chronically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of food allergy involves two steps: identification of the food sensitization and confirmation of clinical allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Identification involves history taking and allergy testing. Patients are unlikely to have food allergies as a trigger of their severe AD if they have periods of clear skin on a regular diet without medication. Food allergy is a more likely trigger if the onset or worsening of AD correlates with exposure to the food. Infants with AD and food allergy may have additional findings that suggest the presence of food allergy, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Food allergy can be evaluated by either prick skin testing or in vitro testing for food-specific IgE. Eosinophilia may be a predictor of food allergy in patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The diagnostic utility of patch testing for foods in patients with AD is under investigation and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Skin conditions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Future diagnostic tools for food allergy&quot;, section on 'Atopy patch testing'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with AD, the rate of sensitization to foods ranges from 30 to 80 percent, depending upon the population, but the actual rate of confirmed food allergy is much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/24,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,35-37</a>]. As an example, 52 percent of children in a birth cohort who developed AD during the first six years of life were sensitized to at least one food allergen, but only 15 percent had challenge-confirmed food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Wheat was the most common food to which patients were sensitized, but egg was the most common food to which patients were allergic, as confirmed by food challenge.</p><p>Most patients with food sensitization and AD fall into a gray area in which the test is neither negative nor above the 95 percent positive predictive value (PPV). Other patients may have suspected non-IgE-mediated food allergy, for which no standardized diagnostic tests are available. Food challenges need to be performed in these cases to confirm clinical reactivity to the food(s) in question and prevent malnutrition from inappropriate food avoidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Clinical reactivity can be confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) for suspected IgE-mediated allergy or reproducible findings upon elimination and reintroduction of the food for suspected non-IgE-mediated allergy. There is a risk of a more severe reaction, including anaphylaxis, when foods are reintroduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The rate of food-exacerbated AD varies with the severity of the eczema. Approximately 1 to 3 percent of children with mild AD, 5 to 10 percent with moderate AD, and 20 to 33 percent with severe AD have food-induced AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Food-exacerbated AD is rare in adults.

The children with AD were evaluated for food allergy. Food allergy was diagnosed based upon a history of an immediate reaction to a food allergen and a positive skin prick <span class=\"nowrap\">test/specific</span> serum IgE or a history of suspected food allergy with no immediate reaction and either an open <span class=\"nowrap\">elimination/challenge</span> test (performed twice, considered allergic if positive both times) or a DBPCFC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thirty-two percent of children in the above study were sensitized to at least one allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, clinical reactivity was confirmed in only 18 percent. Two children developed AD after they had developed tolerance to the food. The rest of the children (16 percent) developed AD and adverse reactions to food simultaneously and were considered to have food-exacerbated AD. Six children had non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy only. Eight children had IgE-mediated food allergy. The mean SCORAD (<strong>SCOR</strong>ing <strong>A</strong>topic <strong>D</strong>ermatitis) index, a measure of AD severity, was higher in children with non-IgE- or IgE-mediated food allergy than children without food allergy (28 and 30 versus 20, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other studies have reported similar findings with regard to the frequency of food-induced AD reactions in relation to the severity of AD. Food allergies play a role in exacerbating AD in up to 33 percent of patients with severe AD, 10 to 20 percent with moderate AD, and 6 percent with mild AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/8,12,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another birth cohort study, 22 percent (122 of 562) of children had AD. Fifteen percent (18 of 122) were confirmed to have food allergy (by skin prick test, specific IgE, and food challenge). Most children were also sensitized to other foods that they tolerated. Self-reported food allergy was confirmed in less than one-third of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 3- to 15-year-old patients with AD and suspected food allergies, 75 percent (52 of 69) had positive challenges (average two foods, range one to three), based upon comparing pre- and post-challenge photographs of representative skin lesion sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Most patients had negative-specific IgE to the challenge-positive foods. Exclusion of these foods from the diet for three months led to significant clinical improvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis showing lack of benefit of exclusion diets in patients with AD is held up by some as evidence of lack of a role for food allergy in AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, 9 out of 10 of the randomized trials in this meta-analysis enrolled patients with AD who were not selected for a suspicion of food allergy based upon clinical history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> test results. The single trial that did select for patients with suspected food allergy (positive specific IgE to egg and suspected egg allergy) demonstrated that an egg elimination diet led to improvements in the extent and severity of AD in half of infants with AD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Food elimination diets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The findings above highlight that foods should not be eliminated from the diet randomly without firm clinical suspicion. Nor should foods be excluded from the diet long term (as opposed to short term for diagnostic purposes) based upon positive skin or in vitro tests or patient history alone.</p><p>Test results should be correlated with the clinical history and clinical reactivity confirmed when necessary by DBPCFC or <span class=\"nowrap\">elimination/challenge</span> test. Elimination of food allergens in patients with AD and confirmed food allergy can lead to significant clinical improvement. Patients should be evaluated at regular intervals to determine if the food allergy has resolved.

Limited data from case reports, case series, and small, randomized trials suggest that certain subgroups of patients are most likely to respond, such as those without filaggrin mutations or those with lower elevations of total IgE.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and young children with AD are more commonly sensitized to foods, whereas children over five years and adults are more commonly sensitized to aeroallergens. However, evidence of allergen sensitization is not proof of clinically relevant allergy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Allergen sensitization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with AD, the rate of sensitization to foods (positive skin or in vitro test) ranges from 30 to 80 percent, depending upon the population. The rate of confirmed food allergy is much lower. Food allergies play a role in exacerbating AD in up to 33 percent of patients with severe AD, 10 to 20 percent with moderate AD, and 6 percent with mild AD. Elimination of food allergens in patients with AD and confirmed food allergy can lead to significant clinical improvement. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Food allergies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods should not be eliminated from the diet randomly without any clinical suspicion. Nor should foods be excluded from the diet long term (as opposed to short term for diagnostic purposes) based upon positive skin or in vitro tests or patient history alone. Test results should be correlated with the clinical history and clinical reactivity confirmed when necessary by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) or <span class=\"nowrap\">elimination/challenge</span> test. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Food elimination diets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The data on the role of aeroallergens in exacerbating AD are less extensive. Dust mites are consistently the most common positive aeroallergen and also appear to be the most clinically relevant. Immune reactions, both immunoglobulin E (IgE) and T cell mediated, to <em>Malassezia</em> species can also worsen AD.
