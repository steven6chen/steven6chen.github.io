Photokeratitis causes eye pain, redness, and other symptoms. This condition is also called &quot;arc eye&quot; or &quot;snow blindness.&quot;</p><p>People get photokeratitis from being around UV light without eye protection. UV light comes from the sun and some types of lamps and tools, such as sunlamps and welding torches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17016870\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of photokeratitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms usually happen 6 to 12 hours after being around UV light without eye protection. Symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye pain that makes it hard to work, drive, or sleep &ndash; Some people pace or rock back and forth because the pain is so strong.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red, watery eyes, sometimes with swollen eyelids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being very uncomfortable around bright lights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not being able to open the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like there is sand in the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red, swollen face</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17016885\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of the symptoms above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17016900\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for photokeratitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17016915\"><span class=\"h1\">How is photokeratitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photokeratitis almost always goes away on its own. It does not usually cause lasting problems. But it takes 1 to 3 days to get better, and is very painful. Try to wear dark glasses, and stay inside in dark rooms, as much as possible until your symptoms get better.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse can also give treatments to help with symptoms. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control pain &ndash; Some of these medicines can help you sleep. Sleep can help the eyes heal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic ointment to put in the eyes &ndash; This can make the eyes feel better and keep them from getting infected.</p><p/><p>If your doctor or nurse says you have photokeratitis, go back for another visit in 1 or 2 days. Your doctor or nurse will check to make sure your eyes are healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17016930\"><span class=\"h1\">Can photokeratitis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can lower your chances of getting it by wearing sunglasses when you are outdoors. Make sure the sunglasses fit well and block UVA and UVB rays. The label on the sunglasses will say what type of rays they block. If you wear prescription sunglasses, make sure they block both types of UV rays.</p><p>If you work around UV light from welding, high voltage electric lines, or certain types of lamps, wear safety goggles that block UV light. Sunglasses or contact lenses do not give enough protection from these types of light.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
