These endoscopes and catheters are passed through the working channel of a duodenoscope during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). </p><p>The first optical choledochoscope was described in 1941 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and the per oral approach was subsequently introduced in the early 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Continued refinements have resulted in commercially available small-diameter cholangiopancreatoscopes that include working channels and the ability to deflect the tip of the scope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review cholangioscopy and pancreatoscopy performed during ERCP using commercially available instruments.

During cholangioscopy, targeted biopsies of bile duct lesions can be obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68712\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68712 \">picture 4</a>). It can also be used to evaluate equivocal fluoroscopy findings during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, to assess the extent of cholangiocarcinoma prior to surgery, and to identify of stones not seen by conventional cholangiography. In one series that included primary sclerosing cholangitis patients, 30 percent had stones that had been missed by cholangiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>During cholangioscopy, bile duct stones can be fragmented using electrohydraulic or laser lithotripsy probes that are applied directly to the stones.

There is also a catheter-based system (SpyGlass). In addition, cholangiopancreatoscopy can be performed using a slim gastroscope in patients with a dilated common bile duct.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56909361\"><span class=\"h2\">Mother-daughter systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mother-daughter systems are comprised of a mother duodenoscope and a daughter cholangiopancreatoscope. The daughter scope is inserted through the accessory channel of the mother scope. Two endoscopists are required for mother-daughter systems. One endoscopist controls the mother scope, while the other controls the daughter scope. Daughter scopes range in diameter from 3.1 to 3.4 mm, with a working channel of 1.2 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The tip of the daughter scope can be deflected up and down. Commercially available daughter scopes are fiberoptic, though high-resolution video daughter scope prototypes are being investigated. The 1.2 mm working channel permits passage of miniature biopsy forceps and intraductal lithotripsy fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56909368\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter-based system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The catheter-based system requires a single endoscopist for its operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The system includes a 0.77 mm optical probe that is passed through a 3.3 mm 4-lumen catheter. In addition to a lumen for the optical probe, the catheter includes a 1.2 mm working channel and two dedicated 0.6 mm irrigation channels. The tip of the catheter can be deflected in four directions (up-down and left-right).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56909375\"><span class=\"h2\">Slim gastroscopes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Slim gastroscopes can be used in patients with dilated common bile ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]. Like catheter-based systems, only one endoscopist is required. Slim gastroscopes have diameters of 5 to 6 mm, and thus can only be used in patients with dilated common bile ducts. If a gastroscope is being used, insufflation should be with saline, water, or CO<sub>2</sub>, as air insufflation has been associated with air embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The advantage of using a slim gastroscope is that the video image quality is superior and may include narrow band imaging capability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55989\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55989 \">picture 9</a>); the working channel is larger and can accommodate argon plasma coagulation probes, larger biopsy forceps, and lithotripsy fibers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341530902\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341531002\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), patients typically take no food by mouth for four to eight hours and sometimes longer if there is known or suspected delayed gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Some medications may need to be adjusted prior to upper endoscopy, such as medications for diabetes, due to decreased oral intake around the time of the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341531016\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of anticoagulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions regarding the management of antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants must take into account the risk of bleeding engendered by maintaining the patient on the agent through the procedure, and the risk of a thromboembolic event if the agent is discontinued in the periprocedural period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Many patients undergoing cholangioscopy will require a sphincterotomy, which is considered to be a high-risk procedure with regard to bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50700\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50700 \">table 1</a>).

However, preprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis has generally been recommended for all patients due to a potentially higher rate of cholangitis when compared with those patients undergoing ERCP without cholangioscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The antibiotic regimens used are the same as those used for other patients undergoing ERCP who require antibiotic prophylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54121\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54121 \">table 2</a>). Antibiotic prophylaxis is also recommended for pancreatoscopy, especially in the setting of obstructing pancreatic duct stones.

Lesions and suspicious areas identified during cholangiography can be mapped with spot radiographs to aid with subsequent cholangioscopic localization. Sphincterotomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stricture dilation are performed as needed to facilitate scope passage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Daughter cholangioscopes or catheter-based systems are passed through the working channel of a standard therapeutic duodenoscope. Following ERCP and guidewire access to the common bile duct or pancreatic duct, the cholangiopancreatoscope is advanced over the guidewire and into the duct using a combination of endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75248\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75248 \">image 7</a>). If a slim gastroscope is being used, it may be inserted into the duct over a guidewire placed during ERCP or by way of a freehand technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Once the scope is advanced to the target location, the guidewire (if used) is removed to enhance visualization and to permit use of the working channel. </p><p>Factors that may complicate scope passage include narrow duct diameters and tight strictures. In addition, circumferential visualization may be compromised by the presence of a markedly dilated duct.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953407351\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraductal lithotripsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) can be used to treat both bile duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53961\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53961 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54231\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54231 \">picture 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63431\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63431 \">image 8</a>) and pancreatic duct stones. Cholangioscopic or pancreatoscopic visualization during intraductal lithotripsy helps to avoid duct injury. The EHL fiber contains two coaxially insulated electrodes ending at an open tip. During water immersion, sparks are generated that produce high-amplitude hydraulic pressure waves for stone fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A generator produces a series of high-voltage electrical impulses at a frequency of 1 to 20 per second, with settings ranging from 50 to 100 volts. The tip of the EHL fiber should protrude no more than 2 to 3 mm from the scope and be positioned <em>en face</em> with the stone while the generator's foot pedal is depressed to deliver energy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrohydraulic-lithotripsy-in-the-treatment-of-bile-and-pancreatic-duct-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrohydraulic lithotripsy in the treatment of bile and pancreatic duct stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An alternative to EHL is pulsed laser lithotripsy. During laser lithotripsy, a laser beam is transmitted via a flexible quartz fiber through the working channel of the cholangiopancreatoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80055\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80055 \">picture 7</a>). The application of repetitive pulses of laser energy to the stone leads to the formation of a gaseous collection of ions and free electrons of high kinetic energy. This plasma rapidly expands as it absorbs the laser energy and then collapses, inducing a spherical mechanical shockwave between the laser fiber and stone, leading to stone fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser lithotripsy for the treatment of bile duct stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953407418\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraductal biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two methods can be used to obtain targeted biopsies from the bile duct: cholangioscopy-directed biopsy and cholangioscopy-assisted biopsy. Cholangioscopy-directed biopsy is performed by passing a miniature cholangioscope biopsy forceps through the working channel under direct endoscopic visualization. </p><p>For cholangioscopy-assisted biopsy, the target biopsy site is localized using cholangioscopic visualization and fluoroscopic spot films of the cholangioscope tip positioned at the lesion. After removing the cholangioscope, a conventional biliary biopsy forceps is then passed through the working channel of the duodenoscope to obtain tissue samples under fluoroscopic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Failure of stone clearance occurred in 11 patients. Reasons for failure included difficult stone location (four patients), stricturing below the stones (two patients), poor patient health status precluding additional interventions (one patient), failure of stone clearance requiring common bile duct exploration (one patient), and failure to remove a stone due to a broken cholangioscope. Five of the patients with failed stone clearance had stones in the common hepatic or intrahepatic ducts.

Twelve of the patients had had a prior attempt at mechanical lithotripsy. In the remaining 14, mechanical lithotripsy had not been attempted because the stones were intrahepatic (four patients), because a stricture was present (six patients), because the stones were in the cystic duct (two patients), or because the stones were impacted in the common bile duct (two patients). Mechanical lithotripsy was not reattempted according to the study protocol, which may explain the high clearance rate compared with other series.</p><p/><p>Limited and older studies have compared EHL or laser lithotripsy with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), in which stones are fragmented using shock waves that are directed through the body onto the stone(s). With the increased availability of cholangioscopy, ESWL for biliary stones is not utilized as ERCP is still required to remove stone fragments (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy-for-pancreatic-stones#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for pancreatic stones&quot;, section on 'Application of shock waves'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A non-randomized comparison of 118 patients who underwent ESWL or per oral cholangioscopy with EHL revealed similar stone clearance rates in the ESWL and EHL groups (79 versus 74 percent, p&gt;0.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].<sup> </sup>The disadvantage in the ESWL group was the necessity to perform ERCP to extract stone fragments.
