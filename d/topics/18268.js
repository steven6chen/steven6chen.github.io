Dysphoria can take many forms, such as feeling sad, hopeless, discouraged, &ldquo;blue,&rdquo; or &ldquo;down in the dumps.&rdquo; Patients who appear sad (eg, tearful) may initially deny sadness and state that they feel anxious, &ldquo;blah,&rdquo; or have no feelings. In addition, increased and persistent annoyance, frustration, irritability, anger, or hostility occurs in roughly 50 percent of patients with major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Loss of interest or pleasure</strong> &ndash; Loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia) in formerly pleasurable activities is also a cardinal symptom of unipolar major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Patients may also appear easily distracted or complain of memory difficulties.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most depressed patients (especially younger and middle aged adults), cognitive dysfunction is readily distinguished from that caused by delirium or dementia. Neurocognitive dysfunction in depression is generally mild, and marked by a greater number of subjective complaints rather than objective findings. In older adult patients, memory problems may be mistaken for dementia (&ldquo;pseudodementia&rdquo;); these problems often abate with successful treatment of the depressive syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In addition, cognitive impairments can interfere with occupational functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and persist after patients have remitted from major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychomotor agitation or retardation</strong> &ndash; Major depressive episodes may include psychomotor disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Agitation &ndash; Excessive motor activity that is usually nonproductive, repetitious, and accompanied by a feeling of inner tension; examples include hand-wringing, pacing, and fidgeting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Retardation &ndash; Generalized slowing of body movements, thinking, or speech. Speech volume, quantity, and inflection may be decreased, with increased latency in answering questions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Psychomotor disturbances are less common than other symptoms, but indicate that the patient is more severely ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt</strong> &ndash; The self-perceptions of depressed patients may be marked by feelings of inadequacy, inferiority, failure, worthlessness, and inappropriate guilt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Worthlessness and guilt can occur in unipolar major depression and persistent depressive disorder, and frequently manifest with misinterpreting neutral events or minor setbacks as evidence of personal failings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Suicidal ideation and behavior</strong> &ndash; Depressed patients can experience recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, and may attempt suicide. Suicidal ideation may be passive, with thoughts that life is not worth living or that others would be better off if the patient was dead. By contrast, active suicidal ideation is marked by thoughts of wanting to die or commit suicide, and indicates the patient is severely ill. In addition, there may be suicide plans, preparatory acts (eg, selecting a time and location to commit suicide, purchasing a large amount of medication or a gun, or writing a suicide note), and suicide attempts. Suicidality is increased by pervasive hopelessness (negative expectations for the future) and the conclusion that suicide is the only option to escape ceaseless and intense emotional pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Major depression with psychotic features may include auditory hallucinations telling (commanding) patients to commit suicide.

Although patients may deny that they intended to kill themselves, this behavior (nonsuicidal self-injury) indicates the patient is severely depressed; nonsuicidal self injury is associated with suicide attempts in which patients do intend to kill themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Depression may be conceptualized as disturbances in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotions &ndash; Depressed mood and loss of interests or pleasure occur in depression. The nature of the &quot;depressed&rdquo; or dysphoric mood may vary. Some patients communicate intense sadness and emotional distress, while others report a sense of emotional numbness (&quot;blahs&quot;) and exhibit a &quot;flattened&quot; affect on examination. The mood may be experienced subjectively by the patient, or may be observable on mental status examination. Patients may present with prominent anxiety or irritability; although not specific for depression, these symptoms should be recognized as part of a depressive episode if they occur in the context and timeframe of other depressive features.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideation or cognition &ndash; In addition to the cognitive symptoms listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (impaired concentration or memory, worthlessness or guilt, thoughts of death or suicide), other cognitive symptoms in depression include hopelessness, helplessness, and ruminative thinking (defined as the tendency to dwell on a single theme, which in depression tends to be negative).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurovegetative (somatic) functioning &ndash; Somatic symptoms of depression include changes in sleep, appetite or weight, energy, libido, and psychomotor activity. Some symptoms, such as loss of energy or libido, occur in only one &ldquo;direction&rdquo; (decreased). Other symptoms, including changes in sleep, appetite or weight, and psychomotor functioning are potentially bidirectional; insomnia and anorexia with weight loss are most common in depression, but atypical features of hypersomnia or hyperphagia with weight gain can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H24274330\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Depressive episode subtypes (specifiers)'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Some studies suggest that the clinical presentation of major depression may vary between females and males, and that males may exhibit symptoms that are not included in the formal diagnostic criteria for major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Depressed women may be more likely to report neurovegetative symptoms (eg, sleep, appetite, or energy problems) and other physical symptoms (eg, headaches, myalgias, or gastrointestinal symptoms), as well as emotional (eg, stress or crying easily) and psychosocial symptoms (eg, interpersonal difficulties) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. By contrast, it is hypothesized that depressed men present with symptoms that are &ldquo;depressive equivalents,&rdquo; such as anger <span class=\"nowrap\">attacks/aggression</span> (eg, suddenly losing control and hurting someone or threatening to hurt someone), substance use disorders, and risk-taking behavior (eg, casual or unsafe sex, or reckless driving) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, it is not clear that phenomena such as substance use disorders represent a symptom of depression, or are better conceptualized as a separate or comorbid disorder.</p><p>In addition, depressive subtypes may vary between males and females, but the differences appear to be modest. An observational study (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study) of 2541 outpatients with unipolar major depression found that major depression with anxious distress occurred in more women than men (48 versus 41 percent), as did major depression with atypical features (18 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273529568\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDINAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28610507\"><span class=\"h2\">Heterogeneity of depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unipolar major depression is heterogeneous with regard to age of onset, symptom profile, subtypes, severity, and course of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>].

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) utilizes the following subtypes, which have been proposed in an attempt to provide greater diagnostic specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features/abstract/1,2,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catatonic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melancholic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed features</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripartum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seasonal</p><p/><p>However, these subtypes are not mutually exclusive, meaning that the same depressive episode may have features of more than one subtype.
