During childhood and puberty, the most important effects of growth hormone (GH) are on linear growth, and high doses of GH are required for replacement therapy. During adulthood, GHD is associated with altered body composition and diminished quality of life, and much lower GH doses are needed to counteract these effects. The diagnosis and management of these phases of GHD are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone deficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Only a minority of children with GHD will remain deficient as adults and require ongoing GH therapy. The &quot;transition period&quot; between these phases is loosely defined as occurring from<strong> </strong>mid-to-late teens until six to seven years after reaching near-adult height. The transition period raises the following clinical questions, which will be addressed in this topic review: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which individuals with childhood GHD will remain deficient as adults?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When and how should testing be performed to determine whether an individual has persistent GHD?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should patients be monitored during and after the transition period to determine appropriate dosing for GH therapy?</p><p/><p>These questions are not relevant to the disorders other than GHD for which GH treatment is indicated, including children born small for gestational age, chronic kidney disease, Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome (which may represent a GH-deficient state), and idiopathic short stature. For these disorders, GH therapy is generally stopped when linear growth is complete, with the possible exception of Prader-Willi syndrome, for which GH is sometimes continued into adulthood to enhance body composition, although this is still an experimental use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

In the past, most pediatric endocrinologists only planned to treat the child with GHD until near-adult height is reached (ie, growth less than 2.0 to 2.5 cm per year, which corresponds to the downward slope of height velocity after passing peak height velocity). However, individuals with persistent GHD benefit from continuing GH treatment into adulthood, because GH is required to achieve full adult body composition, regional distribution of body fat, and accrual of normal bone mineral content. </p><p>Therefore, the following issues should be discussed in detail with the family <strong>before</strong> GH treatment is begun:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child may require ongoing GH treatment during the transition period</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child should be retested for GH deficiency during late adolescence (usually when they reach near-adult height). The exception is the child with one of the genetic, organic, or structural disorders that predictably leads to permanent GHD. (See <a href=\"#H8327058\" class=\"local\">'Genetic, organic, or structural causes of GHD'</a> below.)) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child remains GH-deficient when retested, he or she will be referred to an endocrinologist who evaluates and treats adults with GHD </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals who remain GH-deficient during adulthood, lower doses of GH are required for treatment as compared with childhood</p><p/><p>This discussion prepares the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> parents for the retesting and possible referral to another endocrinologist, when the appropriate time arrives. The pediatric endocrinologist typically initiates the process for retesting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12213561\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTING RISK FOR CONTINUING GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8327051\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated GHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among children diagnosed with <strong>isolated</strong> GHD during childhood, more than two-thirds will have normal results when retested for GHD during late adolescence or adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These discrepancies are probably in part because of the inherent imprecision in diagnosing GHD, because of the low reproducibility of the stimulation tests. In addition, a mild GHD may not have clinically important effects during adulthood because the metabolic effects of GH are seen at low doses, whereas the same individual may have clinically important effects during childhood because high concentrations of GH are required to stimulate growth. </p><p>Because the majority of patients with isolated GHD will be GH sufficient by late adolescence or adulthood, it is important to repeat the GH stimulation test during the transition period to determine if they require ongoing therapy. Retesting is also appropriate for patients with deficiency of only one additional pituitary hormone, those with an ectopic posterior pituitary and those who have received irradiation, because a number of these patients may not have permanent GHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Genetic GHD is usually recognized by the presence of affected relatives and confirmed by molecular testing for the causative genes, which include <em>POU1F1</em> (<em>Pit-1</em>), <em>PROP-1</em>, and <em>GH-1</em>. Patients with <em>GH-1</em> mutations tend to develop neutralizing antibodies shortly after initiation of GH treatment, causing a characteristic rapid loss of the growth response to GH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Molecular genetics of growth hormone deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H562861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Growth response to GH therapy'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Structural causes </strong>(eg, associated with mid-line craniofacial anomalies such as optic nerve <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoplasia/septo-optic</span> dysplasia). GHD is highly likely to be permanent in patients with congenital anomalies, eg, agenesis of the hypothalamic-pituitary stalk (infundibulum), in the sellar or suprasellar region, as shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An exception is the finding of an ectopic posterior pituitary, which is not consistently associated with permanent GHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Organic causes</strong> of GHD: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GHD following brain surgery and radiation therapy for craniopharyngioma or other brain tumors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GHD following irradiation therapy to the brain for hematologic malignancies (which is especially common with doses &gt;40 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Infants or young children are particularly vulnerable to developing permanent GHD after brain radiation; some also develop precocious puberty (especially girls).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. As an example, for those with deficiencies of three or more pituitary hormones, the likelihood of persistent GHD is greater than 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p>Because patients with these characteristics are very likely to have permanent GHD, extensive testing for GHD during the transition period is not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Instead, the ongoing deficiency can be confirmed by discontinuing GH therapy for approximately one month and then measuring the serum concentration of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). If the IGF-I concentration is below -2 SD from the mean, ongoing GHD is confirmed. In the past, some insurance companies required more extensive GH stimulation testing, as described below. However, clinical practice guidelines specifically state that stimulation testing is NOT necessary to confirm permanent GHD in patients with these characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Note that a normal serum IGF-I in this context does not rule out GHD in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1547795849\" class=\"local\">'IGF-I'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3638513\"><span class=\"h2\">Other predictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have very low GH peaks during stimulation tests done as children (GH &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> are more likely to have permanent GHD as compared with those with higher peak stimulated levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8327080\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING FOR CONTINUING GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8327088\"><span class=\"h2\">When should retesting be done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing for testing for continuing GHD during the transition period has not been established. Each of the following approaches has merit: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retesting as near-adult height is reached (ie, when the growth rate decelerates to less than 2.0 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year),</span> generally occurring in late puberty. This is the most commonly used approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retesting in mid-puberty. This approach is based on the hypothesis that entry into puberty stimulates the GH-secreting apparatus in those children who would eventually become GH sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If the patient is no longer GH deficient, then testing at this time would reduce the length of GH treatment by three years or more. This approach is not optimal for patients with a high likelihood of having permanent GHD (eg, patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retesting at the end of the transition phase (age in mid-20s). Disadvantages of this approach are that patients without ongoing GHD would have several years of unnecessary treatment, and those with ongoing GHD would be treated for several years with the higher doses required for growth stimulation, rather than the lower dose required for metabolic effects in an adult. Therefore, this approach is not optimal for patients with isolated GHD, among whom the majority will not need ongoing GH treatment as adults.</p><p/><p>For patients who have a history of cranial radiation therapy, the results of retesting should not be considered definitive because radiation tends to cause progressive damage to the hypothalamus and pituitary. Even if GH testing is normal several years after completion of radiation therapy, the patient may still become increasingly GH deficient. Therefore, patients should be retested for GHD for five to ten years after completion of radiation therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8327119\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests to evaluate for continuing GHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with isolated GHD, or those with deficiencies of GH and involvement of only one additional hypothalamic-pituitary hormonal axis, should be evaluated to determine if their GHD is permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The first step is to measure a serum level of IGF-I during a trial off GH therapy. Those with a low level should be further evaluated with a GH stimulation test. </p><p>Testing is not necessary for patients with multiple (three or more) pituitary hormone deficiencies, or an established genetic or structural cause other than ectopic posterior pituitary. In this setting, the GHD can be presumed to be permanent, and GH therapy continued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, some experts still prefer to establish the diagnosis of permanent GHD by at least confirming that IGF-I levels are low. (See <a href=\"#H8327058\" class=\"local\">'Genetic, organic, or structural causes of GHD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8327149\" class=\"local\">'Dosing and monitoring GH therapy during the transition and into young adulthood'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1547795849\"><span class=\"h3\">IGF-I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to measure the serum concentration of IGF-I. GH therapy should be stopped for approximately one month prior to IGF-I testing.</p><p>For patients with isolated GHD, or those with deficiencies of GH and only one additional pituitary hormone, a low IGF-I result (&lt; -2 SD for age and gender) suggests the possibility of permanent GHD. These patients should be further evaluated with a GH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis. (see <a href=\"#H57832873\" class=\"local\">'GH stimulation testing'</a> below). A normal IGF-I result (&gt;0 SD) suggests that permanent GHD is unlikely, and GH therapy can be stopped. </p><p>A consensus guideline suggests that testing is not necessary for patients with multiple (three or more) pituitary hormone deficiencies, or an established genetic or structural cause other than an ectopic posterior pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, some experts still prefer to confirm a low IGF-I during the transition period, to establish the diagnosis of permanent GHD. If IGF-I is low, stimulation testing is not necessary for this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57832873\"><span class=\"h3\">GH stimulation testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with isolated GHD (or those with deficiencies of GH and one other pituitary hormone) and a low IGF-I level, stimulatory testing is indicated to determine if GHD is persistent. GH therapy should be stopped for at least one month prior to testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For this purpose, one stimulation test is generally considered sufficient (although two different stimulants are recommended for the initial diagnosis of GHD in children). Several different stimuli have been used for this purpose: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insulin</strong> &ndash; The insulin tolerance test (ITT, or insulin-induced hypoglycemia test) remains widely regarded as the &quot;gold standard&quot; test for the diagnosis of adult GH deficiency. Because it induces hypoglycemia, it is contraindicated in patients with coronary or cerebrovascular disease or those at risk for seizures, such as patients who have had transcranial surgery for craniopharyngioma. In adult patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies tested with ITT, a peak GH response of &lt;5.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> has approximately 95 percent specificity and sensitivity for detecting GHD, which is somewhat better than those for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. The cutoff values for adolescents may be slightly higher than those in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults#H1759866\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone deficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Insulin-induced hypoglycemia'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Glucagon</a> &ndash; A common approach is to use glucagon (1 mg) for a stimulation test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sampling is continued for three or four hours because there are some late responders to this stimulus. Published reports indicate a sensitivity of 97 to 100 percent and a specificity of 88 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], but the evidence base for this test is limited. The GH response to glucagon stimulation depends on body mass index (BMI) as well as glycemic dynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Moreover, a separate study reported that 14 percent of the patients would have been misclassified by the glucagon stimulation test compared with the ITT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>For all of these stimulation tests, the optimal cut-off and predictive values results in lean individuals differ markedly from those who are obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Obese individuals without GHD have a blunted response to stimulation testing (lower peak value) as compared with lean individuals, and stimulation tests are somewhat less accurate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8327134\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision to treat in individuals who remain GH deficient as adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stopping GH therapy during adolescence in a patient with ongoing GHD affects adult body composition. Muscle mass and bone mineral accrual are diminished and regional distribution of body fat is altered, with increased total body fat and a greater proportion in the deep visceral compartment, changes that are associated with increased cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/5,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20,21</a>]. The effects of GH on bone mineral density are particularly important during early adulthood, when bone mass normally continues to accumulate. In addition, adult GHD is associated with subjective symptoms, including diminished quality of life, especially energy and vitality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Continued treatment with GH prevents most of these consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>For these reasons, for most patients with GHD during childhood who also have evidence of GHD when retested during the transition period, we suggest treatment with GH during adulthood. This will include most patients with underlying genetic, organic, or structural causes of GHD. By contrast, continued GH treatment in adulthood is not necessary for patients who remain asymptomatic when GH is withdrawn, particularly if the results of GH testing during the transition period are equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Treatment with GH is not recommended in patients with active malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone deficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8327149\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing and monitoring GH therapy during the transition and into young adulthood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of GH required for growth during childhood and adolescence is higher in terms of absolute dose, and far higher per kilogram of body weight (or per m<sup>2</sup> body surface area) compared with doses required to treat GHD during adulthood. The relatively high doses of GH are continued until linear growth is nearly complete (ie, the growth rate decelerates to 2.0 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year)</span>. A few adolescents with suboptimal growth on standard doses of GH are treated with &quot;pubertal dosing&quot; in the range of 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg</span> per day to mimic physiology and to maximize linear growth (as compared to the usual prepubertal dose of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day)</span>. Studies of long-term effects using these high pubertal doses of GH are lacking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H1717695935\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Duration of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>After linear growth is complete the patient is transitioned to &quot;adult dosing&quot; if ongoing GH treatment is indicated. The starting dose for an adult is approximately 200 to 300 micrograms per day (total dose). Women will often require a larger dose than men (in the range of 600 to 900 micrograms per day and more if they are receiving oral estrogens).</p><p>To optimize the GH dose for an adolescent during the transition period, we begin with the adult dose and then titrate to a serum IGF-I level in the upper portion of the normal range for age and gender. In our practice, we measure serum IGF-I concentrations one to two months after beginning the adult dose of GH and titrate the GH dose until the IGF-I level is within the appropriate range without side effects such as those related to fluid retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8327095\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.) </p><p>Monitoring of therapy should follow the plan noted in the paragraph just above. When the appropriate dose is attained without side effects, the frequency of visits can decrease to one to two per year. At each visit the history is reviewed for possible treatment-emergent adverse events, IGF-I level, fasting glucose level, Hemoglobin A1c, and a lipid profile. Since GH affects body composition and the regional distribution of body fat, we also obtain a dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan for body composition and bone mineral density at the onset of therapy. If the initial results are abnormal, we repeat the scan periodically (eg, at least 18 months later) to objectively define the response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. </p><p>Individuals with GHD during childhood caused by radiation therapy should be followed with serial stimulation tests during adulthood, even if the test during the transition period suggested no residual GHD. This is because the damage to the hypothalamus and pituitary function caused by radiation may continue to progress over five to ten years after the end of the radiation therapy. </p><p>A quality of life inventory may be helpful in patients with somatic and psychological complaints because reduced quality of life can be an indication for GH therapy in GH-deficient adults. Quality of life is usually assessed via self-administered questionnaires that reflect a variety of health-related, economic, and social factors. Quality of life measures may be broadly correlated with, but are different from, assessments of affect or cognition. Disease-specific quality of life assessment questionnaires have been validated and are now widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/5,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25,26</a>].

The &quot;transition period&quot; between these phases is loosely defined as occurring from<strong> </strong>mid-to-late teens until six to seven years after reaching near-adult height. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among children with <strong>isolated</strong> GHD, more than two-thirds will have normal results when tested for GHD as adults. Because the majority of these patients with isolated GHD during childhood will be GH-sufficient as adults, it is important to repeat the GH stimulation test during the transition period to determine if they will require ongoing therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8327080\" class=\"local\">'Testing for continuing growth hormone deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, GHD is usually permanent in patients with <strong>genetic</strong> causes of GHD (recognized by a family history of GHD), <strong>structural</strong> causes of GHD (eg, optic nerve hypoplasia), or <strong>organic</strong> GHD (eg, caused by brain surgery, brain tumors, intracranial irradiation, or associated with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies). (See <a href=\"#H8327058\" class=\"local\">'Genetic, organic, or structural causes of GHD'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retesting for GHD during the transition period is usually done when near-adult height is reached (ie, when the growth rate decelerates to less than 2.0 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year),</span> occurring in late puberty. Earlier retesting (eg, in mid-puberty) may be beneficial for patients with mild isolated GHD. Later retesting (eg, in young adulthood) can be considered for patients with a high risk for ongoing GHD (genetic, structural, or organic GHD). (See <a href=\"#H8327088\" class=\"local\">'When should retesting be done?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retesting for GHD during the transition period usually employs the insulin tolerance test (ITT), which induces hypoglycemia to stimulate GH release, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a>. A peak GH response of &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> suggests GHD. (See <a href=\"#H8327119\" class=\"local\">'Tests to evaluate for continuing GHD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with genetic, organic, or structural causes of GHD (other than ectopic posterior pituitary), testing for GHD during the transition period is not necessary, because these patients are very likely to have permanent GHD. However, some experts choose to confirm ongoing GHD by documenting low serum concentration of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) during at least a one-month trial off of GH. (See <a href=\"#H8327058\" class=\"local\">'Genetic, organic, or structural causes of GHD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have a history of cranial radiation therapy, the results of retesting should not be considered definitive, because radiation tends to cause progressive damage to the hypothalamus and pituitary. Patients who are GH-sufficient during the transition period may develop increasing GHD over time and should be followed and retested for GHD periodically. (See <a href=\"#H8327088\" class=\"local\">'When should retesting be done?'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with GHD during childhood who also have evidence of GHD when retested during the transition period, we suggest treatment with GH during adulthood (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, GH treatment in adulthood is not required for asymptomatic patients without underlying genetic, organic, or structural causes of GHD, particularly if the results of GH testing are equivocal. (See <a href=\"#H8327134\" class=\"local\">'Decision to treat in individuals who remain GH deficient as adults'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with GH dosing for children, GH doses for adults are lower in terms of absolute dose, and far lower per kilogram of body weight or per m<sup>2 </sup>body surface. The starting dose for an adult is approximately 200 to 300 micrograms per day. Women will often require a larger dose. To optimize the GH dose for an adolescent during the transition period, we begin with the adult dose and then titrate to an IGF-I level in the upper portion of the normal range for age and gender. (See <a href=\"#H8327149\" class=\"local\">'Dosing and monitoring GH therapy during the transition and into young adulthood'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-during-the-transition-period/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Clayton PE, Cuneo RC, Juul A, et al.
