The most common form of TGA is the dextro type (referred to as D-TGA), in which the ventricles are oriented so that the right ventricle is positioned to the right of the left ventricle and the origin of the aorta is anterior and rightward to the origin of the pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68589 \">figure 1</a>). The anatomical defect of D-TGA leads to cyanotic heart disease as a result of two parallel circulations. The first sends deoxygenated systemic venous blood to the right atrium and back to the systemic circulation via the right ventricle and aorta, and the second sends oxygenated pulmonary venous blood to the left atrium and back to the lungs via the left ventricle and pulmonary artery.</p><p>The survival of patients with D-TGA has dramatically improved from a uniformly fatal disease with introduction of initial medical management consisting of prostaglandin (also known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) therapy and balloon atrial septostomy (BAS), and the development of corrective surgical procedures.</p><p>The management and outcome of D-TGA will be presented here. The pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of D-TGA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of D-transposition of the great arteries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H948619\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management is focused on stabilization of cardiac and pulmonary function and ensuring adequate systemic oxygenation. Therapy is directed towards providing sufficient intercirculatory mixing between the two parallel circulations by maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus with prostaglandin E1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) infusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> balloon atrial septostomy (BAS).</p><p>Once the infant is stabilized, corrective surgery is optimally performed in the first weeks of life.</p><p>The prenatal diagnosis of D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) improves survival as it allows for delivery at a tertiary center, where pediatric cardiologists can make timely postnatal decisions regarding prostaglandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) infusion and the need for a BAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, D-TGA is one of the more difficult congenital heart diseases (CHD) to be diagnosed prenatally and, therefore, most infants present postnatally. Patients with suspected or confirmed D-TGA should be transported as quickly as possible to an institution that has expertise in managing infants with D-TGA. Prior to transport, consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is necessary to ensure optimal medical management before and during the transfer.

A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) promotes intercirculatory mixing.</p><p>The major side effect of prostaglandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) is apnea, and intubation should be considered prior to transport to a pediatric cardiac center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Vasodilation may cause hypotension, which is corrected with volume expansion using IV isotonic saline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4434705\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon atrial septostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important role for cardiac catheterization in D-TGA is to perform a balloon atrial septostomy (BAS). Introduced in 1966, this procedure dramatically increased the survival of infants with D-TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. BAS now is performed to stabilize patients with severe hypoxemia as a consequence of inadequate mixing between the two parallel circuits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. It can be performed at the bedside with echocardiographic guidance, or in the catheterization lab with the use of fluoroscopy and echocardiography. A balloon is placed across the atrial septum into the left atrium either through cannulation of the umbilical vein or percutaneous access of the femoral vein. The balloon is inflated and then pulled vigorously back across the septum. The procedure is repeated at least once, and then echocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment of the defect is performed to ensure intracardiac mixing is adequate for sufficient systemic oxygenation.</p><p>If a BAS is performed and successful, systemic oxygen saturations should begin to increase immediately. If there is adequate mixing at the atrial level, prostaglandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) infusion can often be discontinued as long as there is no concern regarding aortic arch obstruction.</p><p>Brain injury has been raised as a potential complication of BAS. This is based on the theory that patients with D-TGA are at increased risk for cerebral emboli during catheterization, as the systemic venous return is in direct communication with the aorta and cerebral arterial circulation. However, the data are inadequate to support an association with BAS and an increased risk of brain injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 29 infants with D-TGA, 12 had evidence of brain injury on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that included focal ischemic changes suggestive of arterial emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. All 12 patients had a BAS, and none of the 10 patients who did not undergo BAS had evidence of preoperative brain injury. However, this study did not control for the degree of hypoxemia, an indication for BAS, and a potential confounding variable for brain injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent studies of neonates with D-TGA have reported a lower incidence of focal ischemia and found no association between BAS and brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 64 neonates with CHD including 44 with D-TGA, brain injury, predominantly white matter injury, occurred in 19 patients (30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There was no association between BAS and brain injury in infants with D-TGA. The rates and patterns of brain injury were similar in infants with D-TGA compared with those with other complex CHD (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome and pulmonary atresia).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 26 infants with D-TGA including 14 who underwent BAS, 10 patients had periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) due to hypoxia and no patients had evidence of a thromboembolic cerebrovascular accident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients with PVL were more likely to have lower preoperative oxygenation (measured by pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas testing), and a longer time to surgery than those without PVL.</p><p/><p>The majority of these studies suggest that multiple factors are associated with brain injury, particularly the degree and duration of hypoxemia. Despite these results, our practice is to administer a bolus dose of heparin (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg)</span> prior to performing BAS to minimize thrombus formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2923554\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality of D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) has dramatically improved from 90 percent for unoperated patients to rates of less than 5 percent following corrective surgery using the arterial switch operation (ASO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p>In our practice, most patients are referred for surgical repair during the first three to five days of life. The choice of surgical procedure is dependent on the presence and nature of other cardiac anomalies. Our general approach is as follows, although the ultimate choice is decided on an individual setting based on the anatomical features of the patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients without any other cardiac defect (simple D-TGA), ASO is the recommended procedure. In general, the ASO has replaced the earlier atrial switch procedures developed by Mustard and Senning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with D-TGA and a ventricular septal defect (VSD), the preferred procedure is ASO and VSD closure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with D-TGA, large VSD, and significant pulmonary stenosis, the Rastelli procedure, an alternative surgical approach, should be considered. In some cases, ASO with or without repair of the left ventricular outflow obstruction is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Both the ASO and Rastelli procedures are surgical anatomic corrections resulting in a morphologic left ventricle as the systemic ventricle. In comparison to atrial switch procedures, which involved the rerouting of venous return in the atria and are now only rarely performed, the ASO appears to have similar long-term survival rates with reduced long-term morbidity, primarily due to a lower risk of atrial arrhythmias and heart failure. As a result, it is the recommended procedure in most patients with D-TGA. (See <a href=\"#H88581680\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5811268\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial switch operation (ASO)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial switch operation (ASO), originally performed in 1975, has become the standard corrective procedure for patients with D-TGA who do not have significant left ventricular outflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It has supplanted the atrial switch procedures (also referred to as the Mustard and Senning procedures) because of their long-term complications including atrial arrhythmias and right ventricular failure. At the Children's Hospital in Boston, the ASO has been used as the preferred procedure for patients with D-TGA since 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The overall perioperative mortality with the ASO has dropped to nearly 0 percent in patients with simple D-TGA (ie, no other cardiac anomaly) and 4 percent for those with complex D-TGA (ie, additional cardiac anomaly) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H88581680\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>ASO involves transection of both great arteries, and then translocation of the vessels to the opposite root, thereby creating ventriculoarterial concordance (aorta to left ventricle, and pulmonary artery to right ventricle). Translocating the aorta also involves mobilization and reimplantation of the coronary arteries. In the ASO, &quot;buttons&quot; around the coronaries are created and then reimplanted into the neo-aortic root. As a result, it is important to delineate coronary artery anatomy, which is often aberrant, prior to surgical correction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60625\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60625 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries#H2924878\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of D-transposition of the great arteries&quot;, section on 'Other cardiac anomalies'</a>.)</p><p>The Lecompte maneuver, first described in 1981, is widely utilized when performing the ASO. This surgical technique places the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries anterior to the aorta so that the left and right pulmonary arteries straddle the ascending aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This allows for improved orientation of the branch pulmonary arteries and reduces the tension that is created from the anterior translocation of the pulmonary arterial root. The use of this maneuver decreases the risk of subsequent pulmonary artery stenosis and lowers reintervention rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H88582048\" class=\"local\">'Main and branch pulmonary artery stenosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The ASO is typically performed within the first two weeks of life. One case series from a tertiary center in the United States demonstrated that a delay of ASO beyond three days after birth was associated with higher morbidity and increased health care costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The presence of a VSD confers a higher probability of other anatomic abnormalities that make surgical correction more difficult. A complete understanding of all preoperative anatomic details is essential, as additional surgical procedures to the ASO may be necessary, such as aortic arch or atrioventricular valve repair. In patients with particular forms of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, the ASO may not be the preferred surgical procedure.</p><p>Cardiac arrhythmias are unusual, and long-term studies report over 90 percent of patients are in normal sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,18</a>]. Echocardiographic evaluation demonstrates normal left ventricular function in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and more than 95 percent of patients meet the criteria for the New York Heart Association functional class I in long-term follow-up (ie, no limitations during ordinary activity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86102114\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term follow-up is necessary in patients who undergo ASO because complications that require reintervention occur in 5 to 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/17,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-22</a>]. The lesions that most often require reintervention include pulmonary artery stenosis, coronary artery insufficiency, neo-aortic root dilation, and neo-aortic regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H173621864\" class=\"local\">'Long-term morbidity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88582048\"><span class=\"h4\">Main and branch pulmonary artery stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary artery stenosis is the most common indication for reintervention following ASO in the first year of life. Inadequate growth at the neo-pulmonary anastomotic site contributes to pulmonary stenosis. The reported incidence of operative or catheterization-based reintervention ranges from 5 to 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, performance of the ASO in the neonatal period has reduced the need for pulmonary artery banding and the widespread use of the Lecompte maneuver have resulted in a lower incidence of pulmonary stenosis and a reduced reintervention rate of less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>].</p><p>The decision to intervene typically is made as the right ventricular pressure approaches systemic levels. The level of obstruction is generally located in the supravalvar area of the main pulmonary artery, but it can be found at all levels of the right ventricular outflow tract and the branch pulmonary arteries. Supravalvar stenosis is thought to result from scarring at the anastomotic site or inadequate growth of the main pulmonary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis is generally a consequence of tension on the branch pulmonary arteries from their anterior translocation. Prior pulmonary artery banding, repair outside of the neonatal period, and surgical technique have been identified as risk factors.</p><p>Echocardiography is initially used to detect and evaluate pulmonary artery stenosis, but is not as sensitive in detecting branch pulmonary artery stenosis as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Right ventricular pressure should always be evaluated by routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in patients who have undergone ASO; if there is concern for elevated pressure and the proximal pulmonary arteries cannot be identified, alternative imaging techniques, such as MRI, should be considered to determine whether branch pulmonary artery stenosis is present. Proximal branch pulmonary artery stenosis was detected in only 60 to 70 percent of affected patients with TTE, while cardiac MRI identified closer to 90 percent of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, evaluation for branch pulmonary artery stenosis with TTE can be difficult after the Lecompte maneuver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88582069\"><span class=\"h4\">Coronary artery stenosis or insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the early years of the ASO, the coronary artery transfer was the surgical step that created the most difficulty, and led to coronary insufficiency and high hospital mortality. As coronary artery transfer techniques improved, the hospital mortality dropped precipitously to a low level. The long-term success of this procedure, however, depends on the continued patency and growth of the coronary vessels to ensure adequate myocardial blood flow.</p><p>The incidence of coronary events continues to be bimodal with the majority of events (89 percent) occurring in the first three months following the ASO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These tend to be related to &quot;kinking&quot; or other anatomic obstructions to coronary perfusion. Unexplained ventricular dysfunction or poor hemodynamics should prompt early evaluation of the coronaries in the postoperative setting.</p><p>In one study of 1198 survivors after ASO born between 1982 and 2001, the freedom from coronary events was reported 92.7 percent at one year and 88.2 percent at 15 years confirming the increased risk of coronary events in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Risk factors for the development of coronary events include type of coronary anatomy (presence of a single coronary orifice or two coronary orifices originating close to each other) and the occurrence of a major intraoperative event (coronary translocation difficulty, left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac arrest, or temporary mechanical support at the end of the intervention). In this study, 11 patients underwent coronary revascularization at least one year after the ASO.</p><p>However, many patients with coronary artery stenosis or obstruction may be asymptomatic. Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for detecting coronary lesions. Studies that performed postoperative angiography report rates of coronary lesions between 3 to 6.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28-30</a>]. Unfortunately, less invasive screening tests, such as electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, stress tests, and myocardial scintigraphy have shown poor sensitivity for detecting coronary lesions and myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This is likely due to the development of a collateral coronary circulation that provides sufficient myocardial perfusion to limit detection of ischemia on these various screening tests. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) appear to be reasonable alternatives to catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Increased experience with these modalities will hopefully reduce the need for invasive angiography in the future in patients after ASO.</p><p>In addition, the impact of atherosclerotic disease in patients who have undergone ASO remains unknown. There is a hypothetical concern that the process of coronary transfer may predispose these patients to the development of intimal thickening due to altered flow dynamics. Lifetime cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid monitoring are essential for patients with D-TGA who have undergone ASO, to try to minimize atherosclerosis and optimize cardiovascular health.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88585141\"><span class=\"h4\">Neo-aortic root dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By reversing the great arteries in the ASO, the native pulmonary valve becomes the neo-aortic valve, and over time, the neo-aortic root increases in size. In one report of 335 patients, neo-aortic root dilation (defined as a Z-score &ge;3) was observed in 3, 8, 18, and 49 percent of patients at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after ASO, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although neo-aortic root dilation continued to develop in late follow-up, the increase was not clinically significant over time. Risk factors for neo-aortic root dilation were previous pulmonary arterial banding and ASO performed in a later era. The association between neo-aortic root dilation and surgery in a later era is likely due to changes in surgical technique related to increased size of the coronary &quot;buttons&quot; taken for the translocation.

In this operation, there is no attempt to resect the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (ie, pulmonary stenosis). The procedure entails closing the VSD by a baffle so that the oxygenated blood from the left ventricle is directed into the aorta, and placing a conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. The net result is oxygenated blood from the left ventricle flows into the aorta, and the unoxygenated blood from the right ventricle is sent through the conduit into the pulmonary artery.</p><p>The Rastelli procedure requires a sizable and appropriately located VSD so that the baffle can be placed to redirect blood flow into the aorta.

In both procedures, an intra-atrial baffle is created to divert the deoxygenated systemic venous return through the mitral valve to the left ventricle, and into the pulmonary circulation via the pulmonary artery. Simultaneously, the baffle directs oxygenated pulmonary venous return across the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and subsequently to the aorta and the systemic circulation. Although the Mustard and Senning procedures have low early operative mortality, there are long-term sequelae including atrial arrhythmias and heart failure that are associated with late morbidity and mortality. These complications are related to the morphologic right ventricle serving as the pump for the systemic circulation.

Risk factors for psychiatric dysfunction included impaired cognitive functioning and parental stress.</p><p>In a French prospective study of 45 children with D-TGA, patients had normal scores for cognition, language, and verbal working memory at four to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. However, children with D-TGA compared with controls had lower scores on neuropsychologic tests for inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, social cognition, and executive function. Performance in these tests also was better in patients with D-TGA diagnosed prenatally compared with those diagnosed postnatally.</p><p>The results of these studies demonstrate the need to closely monitor the neurodevelopmental status of these patients. We agree with the recommendations of the 2012 scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) that children with D-TGA undergo appropriate surveillance, screening, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral for neurodevelopmental impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

This defect results in the creation of two parallel circulations, in which deoxygenated systemic venous blood returns to the right atrium and is sent back to the systemic circulation via the right ventricle and aorta, while simultaneously oxygenated pulmonary venous blood returning to the left atrium is pumped back to the lungs via the left ventricle and pulmonary artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries#H2924715\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of D-transposition of the great arteries&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries#H30972833\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of D-transposition of the great arteries&quot;, section on 'Physiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a prenatal diagnosis of D-TGA is made or suspected, we recommend a maternal transport to a facility that has expertise in managing neonates with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) including D-TGA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If this is not possible, consultation with a pediatric cardiologist prior to transport is necessary to ensure optimal medical management before and during the transfer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial postnatal management is focused on stabilization of cardiac and pulmonary function and ensuring adequate systemic oxygenation. Therapy is directed towards providing sufficient mixing between the two circulatory systems by maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend prostaglandin E1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) infusion (0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute) in all patients with D-TGA to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus until adequate mixing is achieved either through BAS or surgical intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H948657\" class=\"local\">'Prostaglandin (alprostadil) infusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with severe hypoxemia, we recommend BAS to improve systemic oxygenation by providing adequate intercirculatory mixing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4434705\" class=\"local\">'Balloon atrial septostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend surgical correction for all patients with D-TGA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In patients with simple D-TGA, we recommend that the arterial switch operation (ASO) be the preferred surgical approach versus atrial switch procedures (ie, Senning and Mustard procedures) because of its superior long-term outcome (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In patients with D-TGA and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, the Rastelli procedure may be considered an alternate option to ASO.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of the ASO include pulmonary artery stenosis, coronary artery insufficiency, neo-aortic root dilation, and neo-aortic regurgitation. It remains unknown what effect atherosclerotic disease of the coronaries will have on patients who underwent ASO. Complications of the atrial switch procedures include right ventricular failure, arrhythmias, and baffle-associated complications (eg, superior vena caval obstruction or baffle leak). In particular, older patients who underwent atrial switch procedures are at risk for atrial arrhythmias and progressive heart failure, which are the major causes of late death. (See <a href=\"#H88587238\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term follow-up care is necessary for patients who have undergone surgical repair of D-TGA. Follow-up visits should include review of the interval history (focusing on any new cardiac symptoms), physical examination, and testing that may include electrocardiography (ECG), cardiac imaging (usually with echocardiography), and lipid screening if appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H2923605\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With introduction of prostaglandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) therapy and balloon atrial septostomy (BAS), and the continued evolution of surgical palliation, survival of patients with D-TGA has dramatically improved from a uniformly fatal disease to &gt;90 percent long-term survival. (See <a href=\"#H88581687\" class=\"local\">'Survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although patients following ASO have a slightly reduced exercise capacity, this does not typically restrict their daily level of activity. However, patient who wish to participate in competitive sports should undergo formal evaluation including ECG, echocardiogram, and exercise testing. (See <a href=\"#H173622193\" class=\"local\">'Exercise capacity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88584062\" class=\"local\">'Activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with D-TGA may have mild long-term neurodevelopmental impairment, most likely due to perioperative factors including hypoxemia, acidosis, cardiopulmonary bypass, and hemodynamic instability.
