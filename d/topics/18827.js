Patients who received larger volumes (eg, &gt;2 liters) benefited the most. Because the median volumes of fluid administered in these trials were low (1 liter) and the absolute improvement in the composite response was modest (1 percentage point difference), we suggest choosing the solution based on patient-specific factors such as chemistries, estimated volume of resuscitation, and potential adverse effect of the infused solution.

In both trials, hydrocortisone resulted in faster resolution of shock and was not harmful, but caused hyperglycemia. We suggest administering a glucocorticoid (eg, hydrocortisone) with or without fludrocortisone to patients with refractory septic shock, given a faster resolution of shock and a possible mortality benefit in sicker patients. While it is biologically unlikely that fludrocortisone enhances effectiveness of hydrocortisone, which has some mineralocorticoid effects, the only trial reporting a mortality benefit used combined therapy in sicker patients.
