As a result, hyperprolactinemia results almost exclusively from diseases that cause hypersecretion of prolactin by lactotroph cells. Some of these causes are physiologic and others pathologic.</p><p>This topic will review the major causes of hyperprolactinemia. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum prolactin concentrations normally increase substantially during pregnancy and to a lesser degree in response to nipple stimulation during breastfeeding, physical exertion, and stress. The upper normal value for serum prolactin in most laboratories is approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units). Food does not appear to affect serum prolactin concentrations; therefore, fasting is not necessary when having serum prolactin measured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum prolactin increases throughout pregnancy, reaching a peak at delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82454 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The magnitude of the increase, however, is quite variable; in one study, the mean value at term was 207 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> but the range was from 35 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (35 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The probable cause of the hyperprolactinemia is the increasing serum estradiol concentrations during pregnancy. By six weeks after delivery, estradiol secretion has decreased, and the basal serum prolactin concentration is usually normal, even when the mother is breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nipple stimulation and breast exams</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nipple stimulation during breastfeeding increases serum prolactin concentrations, presumably via a neural pathway. The magnitude of the increase is directly proportional to the degree of preexisting lactotroph hyperplasia due to estrogen. In the first weeks postpartum, as an example, the serum prolactin concentration increases up to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> above baseline in response to suckling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59612 \">figure 2</a>); in contrast, several months after delivery, the increase in prolactin in response to suckling in the breastfeeding woman is usually less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units) above baseline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59612 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In nonlactating women and men, nipple stimulation, breast imaging (mammography, ultrasound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], or breast examination does <strong>not </strong>increase prolactin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Therefore, prolactin may be measured after a breast exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress of any kind, physical or psychological, can cause an increase in the serum prolactin concentration. As with all stimuli of prolactin secretion, women have greater increases than men, presumably due to the effect of their higher serum estradiol concentrations on the lactotroph cells. The magnitude of the increase in prolactin in response to stress is small, so the values rarely exceed 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61085145\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC CAUSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87853567\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic-pituitary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperprolactinemia due to hypothalamic-pituitary disorders includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactotroph adenomas (prolactinomas), which are benign tumors of the lactotroph cell.

The pituitary tumor transforming gene is overexpressed in most lactotroph adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. It also appears to play a role in tumor invasiveness since expression is increased in tumors that invade the sphenoid bone.</p><p>Most adenomas that secrete prolactin and cause hyperprolactinemia are comprised solely of lactotroph cells; however, approximately 10 percent are comprised of both lactotroph and either somatotroph or somatomammotroph cells and, therefore, secrete growth hormone as well as prolactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Lactotroph adenomas are relatively common; they account for approximately 30 to 40 percent of all clinically recognized pituitary adenomas.

However, the adenomas that occur in men are usually larger, in part due to the lack of symptoms or delay in seeking medical attention for symptoms such as erectile dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, the adenomas in men may have an inherently greater rate of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Most lactotroph adenomas are sporadic, but they can rarely occur as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Almost all lactotroph tumors are benign, but a rare tumor can be malignant and metastasize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Both enhanced hypothalamic synthesis of TRH and increased pituitary responsiveness to TRH have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The management of hyperprolactinemia due to hypothyroidism is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperprolactinemia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperprolactinemia&quot;, section on 'Hypothyroidism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87853588\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased clearance of prolactin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two causes of hyperprolactinemia due to decreased clearance of prolactin include chronic renal failure and macroprolactinemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Macroprolactinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Macroprolactinemia is an umbrella term used to describe aggregates of prolactin and antibodies (in particular, antiprolactin autoantibodies) that range in size from approximately 150 to 170 kD. The most common form of native prolactin in serum is 23 kD in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>These complexes are immunologically detectable but not biologically active, so they appear to cause no clinical abnormality. As an example, in a series of 55 women ages 18 to 55 years, none had a history of amenorrhea, eight had oligomenorrhea before age 40 years, and one had galactorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. All subjects had pituitary imaging; no macroadenomas and four microadenomas were seen (consistent with the prevalence of incidentalomas in the normal population). Similar results were seen in a second study of 51 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Thus, macroprolactinemia appears to be a benign clinical condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Although these entities are not of clinical significance directly, they are of clinical significance indirectly because they can be misdiagnosed and treated as prolactin hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Misdiagnosis can be avoided by asking the laboratory to pretreat the serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate the macroprolactin before the immunoassay for prolactin.

Food does not appear to affect serum prolactin concentrations; therefore, fasting is not necessary when having serum prolactin measured. In addition, nipple stimulation or breast examination does not increase prolactin levels in nonlactating women or in men. Therefore, prolactin may be measured after a breast exam. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic causes include lactotroph adenomas, other hypothalamic and pituitary disorders, and medications, most commonly antipsychotics.
