In this study, one-third of the cases were associated with a central venous catheter (CVC).</p><p>In a study using data from the Pediatric Health Information System administrative database (2001 to 2007), the annual rate of VTE among hospitalized children rose steadily over the seven-year study period from 34 to 58 per 10,000 admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The study was not able to determine whether this increase was due to a true increase in the frequency of VTE or an increase in the detection of VTE, and did not have information about the proportion of VTE that were associated with CVCs. A separate study using the 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database reported similar rates in freestanding children's hospitals (40 per 10,000 admissions), and much lower rates in community hospitals (7.9 per 10,000 admissions); nearly 80 percent of the episodes of VTE were associated with an underlying chronic condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In a national registry study from Denmark, rates of pediatric VTE were highest among infants and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The majority of patients (87 percent) had at least one underlying condition or trigger for VTE; 41 percent had a thrombophilic condition (eg, factor V Leiden mutation).

CVC-associated VTEs can occur in the upper venous system (in association with CVCs inserted percutaneously through a jugular or subclavian vein) or in the lower extremity (in association with CVCs placed in the femoral vein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) also may be associated with VTE. In a single-center study of 265 children who underwent PICC placement for various reasons, and who were then followed with weekly ultrasounds until PICC removal, deep vein thromboses (DVTs) were noted in 8 percent; however, the majority of these (&gt;80 percent) were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-thrombosis-and-thromboembolism-in-children-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].
