Nonfatal drowning generally is defined as survival, at least temporarily, after suffocation by submersion in a liquid medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most authors include the loss of consciousness while submerged as a criterion for the syndrome.</p><p>However, some authors have argued that since pulmonary complications may follow the aspiration of water without the loss of consciousness, nonfatal drowning should be defined as survival, at least temporarily, after aspiration of fluid into the lungs (&quot;wet nonfatal drowning&quot;) or after a period of asphyxia secondary to laryngospasm (&quot;dry nonfatal drowning&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In its 2010 resuscitation guidelines, the American Heart Association recommends that the Utstein definitions and methods of data reporting for drowning and related events be used to improve consistency in reporting and research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. According to the Utstein guidelines, drowning refers to: &quot;a process resulting in primary respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in a liquid medium&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The Utstein guidelines further suggest that ambiguous or confusing terms such as &quot;near-drowning,&quot; &quot;secondary drowning,&quot; and &quot;wet drowning&quot; should not be used. Revisions of the Utstein guidelines highlighting core data to include in studies of drowning resuscitation were released in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drowning is a common cause of accidental death in the United States and an important cause of childhood fatalities worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. Low and middle-income countries have the highest rates of drowning, accounting for over 90 percent of such fatalities.</p><p>In the United States, drowning is a major cause of accidental death among persons under the age of 45 years and a leading cause in children under five years of age in states where swimming pools or beaches are more accessible, such as California, Arizona, and Florida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/11,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,18</a>]. The highest incidence of drowning occurs among males, African-Americans, children between the ages of one and five years, persons with low-socioeconomic status, and among residents of Southern states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19</a>]. Drowning is much more common during the summer months.</p><p>The age distribution of submersion injury is bimodal. The first peak occurs among children less than five years of age who are inadequately supervised in swimming pools, bathtubs, or around other liquid-filled containers; approximately 7 percent of these incidents appear related to child abuse or neglect. The second age peak is seen among males between 15 and 25 years old, and these episodes tend to occur at rivers, lakes, and beaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following factors increase the risk of drowning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/2,11,20-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,20-29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate adult supervision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to swim or overestimation of swimming capabilities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk-taking behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of alcohol and illicit drugs (more than 50 percent of adult drowning deaths are believed to be alcohol-related).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothermia, which can lead to rapid exhaustion or cardiac arrhythmias.

As an example, cold water immersion and exercise can cause fatal arrhythmias in patients with the congenital long QT syndrome type 1. Similarly, mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR)-2 gene, which is associated with familial polymorphic VT in the absence of structural heart disease or QT prolongation, have been identified in some individuals with unexplained drowning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Swimmers commonly hyperventilate in order to prolong the duration of underwater swimming, and by so doing they reduce the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) while the content of oxygen (CaO2) does not increase appreciably. As the individual swims, oxygen is consumed and the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) falls to 30 to 40 mmHg before the PaCO2 rises sufficiently to trigger the urge to breathe. This can lead to cerebral hypoxia, seizures, and loss of consciousness, which can result in drowning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatal and nonfatal drowning typically begins with a period of panic, loss of the normal breathing pattern, breath-holding, air hunger, and a struggle by the victim to stay above the water. Reflex inspiratory efforts eventually occur, leading to hypoxemia by means of either aspiration or reflex laryngospasm that occurs when water contacts the lower respiratory tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/2,3,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,33-36</a>]. Hypoxemia in turn affects every organ system, with the major component of morbidity and mortality being related to cerebral hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The literature formerly emphasized the distinction between salt water and fresh water drowning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It was believed that the hypertonicity of salt water caused plasma to be drawn into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, leading to massive pulmonary edema and hypertonic serum. Drowning in fresh water was thought to create the opposite effect, with aspirated hypotonic fluid rapidly passing through the lungs and into the intravascular compartment, leading to volume overload and dilutional effects on serum electrolytes.</p><p>Subsequently, researchers have recognized that this distinction is more apparent among persons who are dead on arrival than among victims who are brought to the hospital alive. Aspiration of more than 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of body weight must occur before blood volume changes occur, and more than 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> before electrolyte changes take place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Because it is unusual for nonfatal drowning victims to aspirate more than 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> the distinction between salt water and fresh water drowning is no longer considered important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Both types of nonfatal drowning result in decreased lung compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and intrapulmonary shunting, leading to hypoxemia that causes diffuse organ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is determined as soon as possible without compromising the safety of the rescuer or delaying the removal of the victim from the water. </p><p>Ventilation is the most important initial treatment for victims of submersion injury and rescue breathing should begin as soon as the rescuer reaches shallow water or a stable surface. Note that the priorities of CPR in the drowning victim differ from those in the typical adult cardiac arrest patient, which emphasize immediate uninterrupted chest compressions. If the patient does not respond to the delivery of two rescue breaths that make the chest rise, the rescuer should immediately begin performing high-quality chest compressions. CPR, including the application of an automated external defibrillator, is then performed according to standard guidelines.

According to the AHA Guidelines for Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), <strong>routine</strong> cervical spine immobilization can interfere with essential airway management and is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/7,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,55</a>]. A cohort study of 2244 submersion victims reported that 11 (0.5 percent) sustained cervical spine injuries and all had obvious signs of injury and a mechanism (eg, diving, motor vehicle crash) suggestive of spinal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to assess the spine of nonfatal drowning patients with an altered mental status (eg, intoxicated) and clinicians should use caution when deciding to remove spinal immobilization.</p><p>Drowning patients can present with life-threatening arrhythmias, and these are treated according to ACLS protocols. Pulses may be very weak and difficult to palpate in the hypothermic patient with sinus bradycardia or atrial fibrillation; a careful search for pulses should be performed for at least one minute before initiating chest compressions in the hypothermic patient because these arrhythmias require no immediate treatment. If the patient does not respond to the delivery of two rescue breaths that make the chest rise, the rescuer should immediately begin performing high-quality chest compressions once the absence of a pulse is established in the hypothermic patient. CPR is then performed according to standard BLS guidelines.

In addition, endovascular and several extracorporeal rewarming options are available in some centers.

Therefore, prolonged resuscitative efforts may be effective (in rare instances, even if continued for several hours) and should be continued until the patient's core temperature reaches 32 to 35&ordm;C (90 to 95&ordm;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A low-reading thermometer may be necessary. Prolonged resuscitations appear more likely to be effective when drowning occurs in cold water or circumstances suggest that hypothermia preceded asphyxia, although data is limited and the relative benefits of cold water have been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Useful treatments may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The head of the bed should be elevated to 30 degrees if potential cervical spine injuries have been excluded. More aggressive measures to reduce elevated intracranial pressure, as well as intracranial pressure monitoring, have not been documented to improve outcomes and are rarely undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics can be used to avoid hypervolemia, but care should be taken to avoid volume depletion, which can lower cardiac output and cerebral perfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in imminent danger of cerebral herniation, hyperventilation may be used acutely as a temporizing measure to reduce intracranial pressure by decreasing intracranial blood volume.

Non-sedating anticonvulsants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>) are preferred because they do not depress consciousness and thereby complicate neurologic assessment.

A number of case series have reported no clear improvement in outcome following the use of therapeutic hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>], and the treatment has been associated with an increased incidence of sepsis, probably secondary to cold-induced immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/46,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,66,67</a>]. However, other case reports describe improved outcomes following such treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>], and several guidelines mention therapeutic hypothermia as a possible intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/7,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,70,71</a>]. Given the weak, equivocal data, we believe it is reasonable either to treat or not to treat unconscious nonfatal drowning patients with therapeutic hypothermia. At a minimum, normothermia is desirable. Hyperthermia should be avoided as it increases cerebral metabolic demands and lowers the seizure threshold. The introduction and on-going management of therapeutic hypothermia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults#H9724176\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-cardiac arrest management in adults&quot;, section on 'Targeted temperature management (TTM) and therapeutic hypothermia (TH)'</a>.)</p><p>The use of barbiturates and controlled hypothermia in unconscious nonfatal drowning victims was reported in 1979 to decrease mortality and neurologic morbidity in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, subsequent studies failed to show any benefit from this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. As an example, one study of 31 comatose, drowned children did not show a difference in outcomes between those treated with mild hypothermia alone, and those treated with mild hypothermia plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentobarbital</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory failure or infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest radiographs may not reflect the severity of the pulmonary involvement and should be performed only when indicated by symptoms.

Antibiotics should be used only in cases of clinical pulmonary infection or if the victim was submerged in grossly contaminated water. If pneumonia follows nonfatal drowning, a high suspicion for water-borne pathogens, such as Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, and Proteus, must be maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

However, the largest assessment of drowning to date, a case-control study of 1094 open water drownings recorded between 1975 and 1996, many of which occurred in colder water, found no association between water temperature and survival with a &quot;good outcome&quot; (defined as no, mild, or moderate neurologic sequelae) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The study did find statistically significant associations between survival with a good outcome and the duration of submersion (88.2 percent were submerged &lt;6 minutes) as well as with patient age (children younger than 5 years did best). Suspected drug or alcohol abuse preceding the drowning was associated with a bad outcome (defined as death or survival with severe neurologic sequelae). Resuscitation standards have changed over the intervening decades since this data was collected, which is among the reasons why it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this retrospective study, but it represents the best evidence available about prognosis. &#160;</p><p>Reported survival rates for drowning victims vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/60,91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,91,92</a>]. Earlier studies reported survival rates as high as 75 percent, with approximately 6 percent suffering a residual neurologic deficit, although the number of neurologically impaired survivors appears to be increasing as the care of non-neurologic complications improves. The case-control study described above reported a mortality rate of 74 percent, with 4 percent of victims surviving with severe neurologic disability.</p><p>There is no high quality evidence to identify early predictors of poor neurologic outcomes that can assist in the decision to discontinue resuscitative efforts, and substantial neurologic recovery has been reported following prolonged submersion and anoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/36,93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,93-95</a>]. However, the absence of spontaneous, purposeful movements at 24 hours is an ominous sign; one study of 44 children with drowning found that all patients in whom such recovery of function did not occur, died or suffered severe neurologic sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drowning is preventable in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drowning-submersion-injuries/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>].

Risk factors for drowning include: inadequate supervision by an adult with a primary responsibility for water safety, inability to swim or overestimation of swimming capabilities, risk-taking behavior, use of alcohol and illicit drugs, hypothermia, seizures, and developmental disorders in children. Drowning ultimately produces tissue hypoxia, which affects virtually all tissues and organs within the body. The distinction between salt water and fresh water drowning is no longer considered important. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'End organ effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilation is the most important initial treatment for victims of submersion injury and rescue breathing should begin as soon as the rescuer reaches shallow water or a stable surface. If the patient does not respond to the delivery of two rescue breaths that make the chest rise, the rescuer should immediately begin performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The Heimlich maneuver or other postural drainage techniques to remove water from the lungs are of no proven value, and rescue breathing should not be delayed in order to perform these maneuvers.
