Colonic dilatation is also observed in patients with congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease), idiopathic or acquired megacolon occurring with chronic constipation of any etiology, and intestinal pseudoobstruction, a manifestation of diffuse gastrointestinal dysmotility of various causes. However, the lack of systemic toxicity distinguishes these presentations from true toxic megacolon.

The incidence in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease was approximately 1 to 5 percent three decades ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], but has gradually decreased because of earlier recognition and intensive management of severe colitis. Clinically symptomatic <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection occurs in approximately 1 percent of all hospitalized patients; a few of these may develop severe colitis with toxic megacolon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most commonly recognized as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), toxic megacolon may also occur with infectious colitides of diverse etiology, ischemic colitis, volvulus, diverticulitis, and obstructive colon cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72629 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features that suggest IBD as a cause of toxic megacolon include a preceding history of diarrhea, bloody stools, abdominal pain, perianal disease, or extraintestinal manifestations such as arthritis, iritis, skin disease, or liver disease.

Toxic megacolon has been described in patients with recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter colitis are very rarely complicated by toxic dilatation, and can usually be differentiated from IBD by histology and endoscopic biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Toxic megacolon may also complicate hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome secondary to infection with E. coli O157 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer than 3 percent of patients with amoebic colitis have a fulminant clinical course, and a small fraction develop toxic megacolon. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> in amoebic colitis may precipitate toxic megacolon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with HIV infection or AIDS, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis is the leading cause of toxic megacolon and emergency laparotomy; this usually occurs in the setting of disseminated CMV infection. CMV infection of the colon may also precipitate toxic megacolon in patients with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one series, for example, 6 of 46 resected colons in patients with ulcerative colitis showed evidence of CMV infection; 5 of these 6 patients had toxic dilatation compared with only 2 of the remaining 40 patients without CMV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of pathogenic mechanisms probably contribute to the development of toxic megacolon in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One possible mechanism is that mucosal inflammation leads sequentially to the release of inflammatory mediators and bacterial products, increased inducible nitric oxide synthase, generation of excessive nitric oxide, and colonic dilatation.</p><p>Extension of the mucosal inflammation may also be important. In contrast to typical ulcerative colitis in which the inflammatory response is limited to the mucosa, toxic megacolon is characterized by severe inflammation of the smooth muscle layer which paralyzes the colonic smooth muscle, thereby leading to dilatation. The extent of dilatation appears to be correlated with the depth of inflammation and ulceration. Damage to the myenteric plexus of the colon is not a consistent finding.</p><p>A number of precipitating factors have been identified. These include hypokalemia, antimotility agents, opiates, anticholinergics, antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema, and colonoscopy. Barium enema or colonoscopy may cause distention, which further impairs the blood supply to the colon wall and increases the mucosal uptake of bacterial products. Discontinuing or rapid tapering of corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, or 5-ASA compounds also may contribute to the development of megacolon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nitric oxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitric oxide (NO) is a known inhibitor of smooth muscle tone that may be involved in the pathogenesis of toxic megacolon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. NO generation occurs in macrophages and smooth muscle cells in the inflamed colon. One group studied full thickness colonic wall specimens of patients who underwent surgery for toxic megacolon, active pancolonic ulcerative colitis, or nonobstructive colonic neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Both the amount and activity of inducible NO synthase were significantly increased in the muscular layer in patients with toxic megacolon compared with the other groups, particularly in the most dilated colonic segments.</p><p>These findings were supported by an animal study which demonstrated that inducible NO synthase was decreased after bowel decontamination with oral nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antibiotics, as well as after administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>; these maneuvers also prevented colonic dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, the diameter of the colon, contractility of the colonic muscle, and intracolonic pressure improved after pharmacologic blockade with NO synthase inhibitors, suggesting a possible treatment for patients with toxic megacolon. Enema therapy with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor was associated with clinical improvement in a patient with toxic megacolon due to ulcerative colitis providing in-vivo evidence for the role of nitric oxide in human toxic megacolon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gross pathologic features of fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon are similar in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, with marked dilatation of the colon, thinning of the bowel wall, and deep ulcers. The histologic hallmark is acute inflammation in all layers of the colon with varying degrees of degeneration, necrosis, and replacement by granulation tissue infiltrated by histiocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The muscle fibers are frequently shortened and rounded with aggregates of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The preservation of colonic submucosal and myenteric plexi is a common feature and is strong evidence against a neuropathic process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The pathologic appearance of toxic megacolon associated with other disorders is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In toxic megacolon secondary to <em>C. difficile</em> (or, rarely, ischemia), the characteristic pathologic features include diffuse ulcerations, raised mucosal nodules, yellowish-white superficial plaques with normal intervening mucosa (typical &quot;pseudomembrane&quot; appearance), and extensive denudation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62422\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62422 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings may also be seen in fulminant amoebic colitis, in addition to the characteristic &quot;wet-blotting paper&quot; appearance of the involved bowel segments, punched-out ulcers, and presence of trophozoites in biopsy specimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytomegalovirus colitis is characterized by the presence of inclusion bodies in biopsy specimens.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxic megacolon affects all ages and both sexes. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at the highest risk for developing this complication early in their disease, not infrequently at initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of those patients with IBD who develop toxic megacolon, approximately 30 percent develop toxic dilatation within three months of diagnosis, and approximately 60 percent within the first three years.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of acute colitis that are frequently resistant to therapy are often present for at least one week prior to the onset of acute dilatation. Severe bloody diarrhea is the most common presenting symptom, while improvement of diarrhea may herald the onset of megacolon. One study of patients with <em>C. difficile</em> colitis and toxic megacolon found that diarrhea was a complaint in 100 percent of cases, malaise in 91 percent, and abdominal pain and distention in 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Physical examination invariably reveals a toxic appearing patient with altered sensorium, tachycardia, fever, postural hypotension, lower abdominal distension and tenderness, with or without signs of localized or generalized peritonitis. However, large doses of steroids, analgesics, or a clouded sensorium may mask the signs or symptoms of toxic megacolon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of toxic megacolon should be considered in all patients presenting with abdominal distension and acute or chronic diarrhea. The diagnosis is clinical, based upon the finding of an enlarged dilated colon on abdominal imaging accompanied by severe systemic toxicity. The initial evaluation should be aimed at establishing the diagnosis of toxic megacolon and at determining the underlying etiology to help institute specific therapeutic measures.</p><p>A thorough history is crucial. Knowledge of prior attacks of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the extent and type of disease, details of prior therapy, extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, recent travel, occupational exposure (eg, day care workers), antibiotic or chemotherapy use, use of antimotility agents, and <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> status are very helpful.</p><p>Plain abdominal films should be obtained immediately. In addition, stool specimens should be sent for culture, microscopic analysis, and <em>C. difficile</em> toxin.</p><p>The most widely used criteria for the clinical diagnosis of toxic megacolon are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic evidence of colonic distension</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PLUS at least three of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever &gt;38&ordm;C</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heart rate &gt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neutrophilic leukocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,500/microL</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PLUS at least one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dehydration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Altered sensorium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrolyte disturbances</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypotension</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain abdominal radiographs are critical for diagnosing toxic megacolon and for following its course. There are several typical features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59217\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59217 \">image 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transverse or right colon is usually the most dilated, frequently greater than 6 cm and occasionally up to 15 cm on supine films [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The descending colon less frequently, and the sigmoid colon and rectum rarely also appear distended. Repositioning of the patient results in redistribution of air in the colon, thereby causing variation in the location of maximal air; thus, the location of air is not as important as the degree of dilatation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple air-fluid levels in the colon are common; the normal colonic haustral pattern is either absent or severely disturbed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep mucosal ulcerations may appear as air-filled crevices between large pseudopolypoid projections extending into the colonic lumen.</p><p/><p>It must be emphasized that even though a maximum colonic diameter greater than 6 cm is consistent with the diagnosis of megacolon, the overall clinical condition of the patient is more important than the absolute width of the dilated segment. Colonic dilatation and systemic toxicity are seen in patients with acute colonic obstruction from volvulus, pelvic tumors, and intraluminal obstructing tumors. In these patients a history of acute or chronic diarrhea is unusual and air is absent in the colon below the point of obstruction. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Barium</a> enema or colonoscopy is often required to diagnose the level and type of obstruction.</p><p>Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) may aid in overall management. High resolution ultrasonography can be used to accurately determine the extent and activity of severe ulcerative colitis and assess the response to therapy; it may also permit the early detection of toxic megacolon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>CT scanning may occasionally be of value in determining the etiology of megacolon. In toxic megacolon due to <em>C. difficile</em> infection, for example, diffuse colonic wall thickening is a very sensitive (but not specific) finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A CT scan may be particularly useful in patients with AIDS who may have several intercurrent intraabdominal processes.</p><p>CT scanning is also especially useful for identifying complications of megacolon, such as perforation or vascular compromise, and is helpful for excluding other causes of colonic distension, such as mechanical obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There may be multiple nonspecific laboratory abnormalities associated with toxic megacolon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytosis with a left shift occurs frequently, especially in patients with <em>C. difficile</em> infection. In contrast, immunocompromised (eg, AIDS patients) or septic patients may exhibit neutropenia. In addition, patients with toxic megacolon may develop anemia from gastrointestinal blood loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte disturbances are extremely common and may be multifactorial. As an example, the inflamed colon loses its capacity to reabsorb salt and water. In addition, the rate of potassium excretion into the lumen may be markedly increased due to inflammatory diarrhea and steroid use. Metabolic alkalosis secondary to volume depletion and potassium loss is associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Metabolic acidosis suggests the presence of ischemic colitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoalbuminemia may not be a prominent feature in the early stages of illness, but a serum albumin concentration below 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> develops eventually in approximately 75 percent of cases due to protein loss and decreased hepatic synthesis due to chronic inflammation and malnutrition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein are usually increased.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete colonoscopy is extremely <strong>risky</strong> in patients with toxic megacolon because it can cause colonic perforation. We feel that it should generally be avoided, although one report suggested that it was safe in patients with severe ulcerative colitis and helped the clinician make therapeutic decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A limited endoscopic examination without bowel preparation (eg, proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) is safer and can be used to diagnose an inflammatory (eg, IBD) or infectious process (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV] or <em>C. difficile</em> colitis) in the rectum or sigmoid colon. However, a limited sigmoidoscopy can miss CMV inclusion bodies since ulcers may be limited to the ascending colon in up to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Similarly, while a proctoscopic finding of pseudomembrane may allow rapid diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> colitis, the rectum may be spared in up to 40 percent of patients with <em>C. difficile</em> colitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H4904350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>If performed, either limited or complete lower endoscopy should be done cautiously, with minimal or no air insufflation, to avoid worsening ileus or <span class=\"nowrap\">distention/perforation</span> of the colon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main goal of treatment is to reduce the severity of colitis in order to restore normal colonic motility and decrease the likelihood of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The initial therapy is medical, which is successful in preventing surgery in up to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, a surgical consultation should be obtained upon admission, and the patient should be evaluated daily by both the medical and surgical team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapy of toxic megacolon in patients with IBD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are placed at complete bowel rest and a nasogastric tube (or long intestinal tube) is inserted to decompress the gastrointestinal tract. Enteral feeding is begun as soon as the patient shows signs of improvement to hasten mucosal healing and stimulate normal motility. The patient should be monitored in the intensive care unit with frequent examinations by the nursing and medical staff to assess for signs of deterioration. Complete blood counts, electrolytes, and serial abdominal plain films are reviewed every 12 hours initially and then daily as the patient improves. Anemia, dehydration, and electrolyte deficits, particularly hypokalemia, may aggravate colonic dysmotility and should be treated aggressively.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) is of limited value in patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or toxic megacolon from any cause. It offers no proven benefit in terms of avoiding surgery or decreasing hospital stay in patients with acute colitis due to ulcerative colitis. In a prospective controlled study of 36 patients, for example, there was no significant improvement in those receiving TPN with total bowel rest; 6 came to surgery and 11 responded medically in a mean time of 24 days in the control group, while 9 came to surgery and 10 responded medically in a mean time of 21 days in the TPN group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>All antimotility agents, opiates, and anticholinergics should be discontinued. Patients should be given prophylaxis for both gastric stress ulcerations and deep venous thrombosis (pneumatic compression stockings). Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended to reduce septic complications and in anticipation of peritonitis resulting from perforation. We generally use ampicillin-gentamicin-metronidazole or a third-generation cephalosporin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>.</p><p>Intravenous corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 100 mg or equivalent every six to eight hours or by continuous infusion) should be given to all patients for the treatment of underlying ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease; this does not increase the risk of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As previously mentioned, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> has been shown in experimental studies to decrease the colonic diameter by diminishing the expression of inducible NO synthase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Some clinicians prefer to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> because of its lower sodium retaining and potassium wasting properties, while others prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> since the parenteral dose is equal to the oral dose. Steroids are <strong>not</strong> used in toxic megacolon due to <em>C. difficile</em> colitis or infectious colitis if the etiology has been established.</p><p>Some authorities recommend adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in patients who have not received steroids for at least 30 days; there is some evidence that it may be more beneficial than intravenous corticosteroids in the treatment of underlying ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although initially popular, ACTH is now infrequently used.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfasalazine</a> and 5-ASA compounds have <strong>no role</strong> in patients with toxic megacolon due to IBD and should be initiated or continued only after the attack begins to resolve. In some instances, a flare may actually coincide with the initiation of certain 5-ASA compounds. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> are useful in the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis refractory to steroid therapy, but experience in toxic megacolon is limited.</p><p>Some authors recommend intermittent rolling maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] or the knee-elbow position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] to help redistribute gas in the colon and thereby promote decompression. These techniques are based upon the observation that when a patient is rolled from the supine to prone position or adopts a knee-elbow position, gas rises to the distal <span class=\"nowrap\">colon/rectum</span> and is more easily expelled. In one uncontrolled study, all 19 patients with toxic megacolon complicating IBD who were treated with the usual medical therapy and rolling maneuvers achieved decompression within 1 to 13 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This technique may be particularly useful in patients in whom the &quot;toxicity&quot; is controlled but colonic dilatation persists.</p><p>Medical therapy is successful when the patient appears to be less toxic, fluid and transfusion requirements decrease, abdominal and colonic dilatation begin to resolve, and laboratory parameters improve. On the other hand, persistent fever after 48 to 72 hours of steroid therapy should raise the possibility of localized perforation or abscess.</p><p>Free perforation, massive hemorrhage, increasing transfusion requirements, worsening signs of toxicity, and progression of colonic dilatation are absolute indications for surgery. In addition, most surgical studies recommend colectomy if there is persistent colonic distention after 48 to 72 hours. However, we recommend prolongation of medical therapy up to seven days if the patient appears to be clinically improving despite persistent megacolon and there is no perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy in patients with other disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the general maneuvers for intensive care unit monitoring cited above (including a nasogastric tube for decompression), medical therapy in patients with toxic megacolon due to diseases other than IBD may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with toxic megacolon due to severe <em>C. difficile</em> colitis, the first step is to stop the offending antibiotic, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> 500 mg four times daily orally or via a nasogastric tube and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> at a dose of 500 mg every eight hours. Fecal concentrations of metronidazole in the therapeutic range are achieved with this regimen because of biliary excretion of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast, intravenous vancomycin has <strong>no</strong> effect on <em>C. difficile</em> colitis since the antibiotic is not excreted into the colon. Fecal microbial transplantation has been used successfully in <em>C. difficile</em> patients with severe colitis including toxic megacolon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-microbiota-transplantation-in-the-treatment-of-recurrent-clostridium-difficile-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Colectomy is reserved for patients who do not improve within 48 to 72 hours, or who show evidence of localized perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Patients with azotemia, lactic acidosis, or white blood cell counts above <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/cu</span> mL are more likely to require emergency colectomy for fulminant <em>C. difficile</em> infection. In a small series of six patients with an acute abdomen secondary to <em>C. difficile</em> colitis, two who developed dilated colons were successfully decompressed by colonoscopy, obviating the need for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with HIV infection who develop toxic megacolon, an aggressive search for treatable infectious and noninfectious causes is warranted, including early limited endoscopy and imaging studies. Patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis or <em>C. difficile</em> infection respond poorly to medical therapy and often require emergent laparotomy with subtotal colectomy and ileostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. In one report, however, four of five such patients died despite emergency colectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Critically ill patients who would not be able to withstand surgery, as well as patients with terminal AIDS, could possibly be managed by careful colonic decompression, antibiotics, and supportive therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fulminant colitis during pregnancy with or without toxic megacolon is especially difficult because the gravid uterus impairs a proper abdominal examination, and diagnostic radiation poses hazards to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, laboratory tests such as hemoglobin and serum albumin concentrations fall during pregnancy, while the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein levels rise; thus, these tests are not reliable measures of disease activity. High dose intravenous steroid therapy (the equivalent of 60 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) results in resolution of 75 percent of cases of fulminant colitis; the remainder requiring urgent colectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subtotal colectomy with end-ileostomy is the procedure of choice for urgent or emergency surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This technique has a lower morbidity and mortality than single stage proctocolectomy and allows subsequent re-anastomosis in most patients. Early surgery in patients without evidence of perforation results in much lower mortality than colectomy performed after colonic perforation has occurred (2 to 8 versus 40 percent or more) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-ulcerative-colitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of ulcerative colitis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Other surgical procedures, such as a &quot;blowhole&quot; colostomy, have been used to treat toxic megacolon resulting from <em>C. difficile</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mortality rates in patients who develop toxic megacolon are variable. Before 1976, the death rate in 604 cases of toxic megacolon was 27 percent (43 of 160) for those treated medically, and 19 percent in 444 patients who underwent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The mortality rates dropped dramatically to between 0 and 2 percent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), probably related to a variety of factors including early recognition of toxic megacolon, better intensive medical management, earlier surgical intervention, and superior postoperative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Variations in mortality rates are also related to the medical or surgical biases of the treating physicians.</p><p>Two studies from the medical literature have shown that 68 to 75 percent of cases of toxic megacolon treated medically did not require a colectomy later, and have remained in remission for up to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Surgical studies report up to a 50 percent rate of future colectomy in patients with toxic megacolon who had presumably responded to medical treatment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/2,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,43</a>]. Early surgery decreased the mortality rate from 22 to 1.2 percent in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>A literature review of patients with toxic megacolon secondary to <em>C. difficile </em>infection between 1968 and 1992 found an overall mortality of 31 to 35 percent, 42 percent for those treated with surgery and 18 percent for those treated medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In two later studies, the overall mortality from severe <em>C. difficile</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">colitis/toxic</span> megacolon was 64 to 67 percent, 71 to 100 percent for surgically treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. These studies suggest that patients who develop toxic megacolon during <em>C. difficile</em> infection can survive with medical therapy alone, and surgery may offer a very limited benefit. On the other hand, surgery should not be extensively delayed in acutely ill patients. In a contemporary series of colectomies performed for toxic megacolon, a 30-day mortality of approximately 15 percent was achieved in patients with either IBD or <em>C. difficile</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>It is generally accepted that colonic dilatation due to infectious colitis has a better prognosis than toxic megacolon occurring in patients with IBD; however, this conclusion is largely based upon small studies or case reports. The prognosis is particularly good when colonic dilatation complicates acute self-limited colitis, and is treated aggressively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxic-megacolon/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3341869673\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
