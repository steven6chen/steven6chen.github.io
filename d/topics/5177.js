Currently, the five-year survival rate is over 95 percent for both seminomas and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) in the United States and Europe. There are approximately 9300 cases of testicular cancer diagnoses and 400 deaths annually from testicular cancer in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Worldwide, there are approximately 72,000 cases and 9000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapy in patients with extragonadal GCTs (mainly mediastinal or retroperitoneal tumors) is generally based upon the experience in men with testicular GCTs, and these patients are often included in clinical trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extragonadal germ cell tumors involving the mediastinum and retroperitoneum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy can cure patients with disseminated GCTs, even in the context of widespread visceral metastases, highly elevated serum tumor markers, and other adverse prognostic features. In contrast to the excellent outcomes for men with good-risk advanced testicular GCTs (over 80 percent relapse-free survival following first-line chemotherapy), up to 60 percent of men who have features of intermediate- or poor-risk disease require additional therapy for relapsed disease following first-line chemotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61906\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61906 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].

Men who are diagnosed with relapsed or refractory testicular GCTs should be referred to a cancer center with multidisciplinary expertise, and patients should be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical studies whenever possible. The management of men who progress during chemotherapy or relapse following treatment for GCTs will be reviewed here.

Biopsy confirmation of relapse is usually not indicated but is important when a nodule or mass appears outside the expected pattern of spread and there is no tumor marker evidence of recurrence. </p><p>As an example, for men with pure seminomas, normal beta-hCG, and relapse only in the mediastinal and hilar nodes, biopsy should be considered to exclude other diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis. It should be noted, however, that there are case reports of men with simultaneous noncaseating granulomas and relapsed testis cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p>Conversely, when the pattern of recurrence (eg, enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes on imaging, or rising serum beta-hCG or alpha fetoprotein) and the timing of recurrence (eg, first two years after initial treatment) are consistent with relapsed GCT, then salvage treatment should be initiated because the likelihood of biopsy contributing to the management of disease is very low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14685200\"><span class=\"h1\">CATEGORIES OF PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for men with relapsed germ cell tumors (GCTs) depends upon the initial treatment and response to prior therapy, the location and timing of the relapse, and tumor histology.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy-na&#970;ve patients &ndash; These men typically presented with stage I GCT, which was managed with active surveillance, radiation therapy (RT), retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, or for stage I seminoma, single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> chemotherapy. These patients typically receive first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy for disseminated disease if they relapse.

(See <a href=\"#H970442809\" class=\"local\">'Platinum-refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For men with a diagnosis of a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT), the possibility of metastatic teratoma complicates management. Because there is no way to know what histopathological elements are present within a mass prior to resection, growing masses are typically treated with chemotherapy to eradicate non-teratoma components. This is followed by resection of any residual disease. Good clinical judgment and experience are essential here. The possibility of a growing teratoma must be considered in men with a history of NSGCT who have an enlarging mass and normal serum tumor markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Teratomas are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy and are usually managed with resection. Growing teratoma should be considered in late relapses and when a mass grows during chemotherapy, especially if serum tumor markers are declining.

For residual masses 3 cm or larger in diameter, Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans are sometimes performed. If there is FDG avidity in the residual masses, then open biopsy is typically performed to determine whether a residual viable malignancy is present. If the biopsy is positive, then the patient is typically treated with additional chemotherapy.

The heterogeneity of patients included in various studies based upon these and other factors makes it difficult to compare the relative efficacy of treatment for relapse, which includes standard-dose, ifosfamide-based chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy (HDT), with hematopoietic stem cell rescue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of initial remission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The response to initial therapy (complete versus partial versus no response) and the duration of remission are important prognostic indicators. Progression of disease either during or within four weeks after completion of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is considered cisplatin-refractory disease. These patients have a very poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H970442809\" class=\"local\">'Platinum-refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Men with NSGCTs who relapse more than two years after their initial chemotherapy were previously considered to have a poor prognosis, but cure rates of up to 68 percent have been reported in contemporary series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Treatment with chemotherapy alone has yielded disappointing results in this setting. Therefore, aggressive surgical resection (either as the primary treatment or following chemotherapy) is strongly recommended because the best outcomes have been reported in men who have undergone resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>].

In this setting, the probability of a relapsed germ cell tumor, rather than a nonmalignant etiology, is high, and there is a significant possibility of other sites of disease appearing during preparation for and recovery after surgery. Furthermore, these patients frequently require postoperative chemotherapy if retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is performed as the initial treatment.</p><p>For retroperitoneal relapses that occur after two years, there is an increased possibility of teratoma.

However, nonrandomized studies have reported more favorable results when compared with historical experience with standard-dose salvage chemotherapy. Not surprisingly, better results have been reported when HDT was used as second-line, rather than third-line, chemotherapy. </p><p>In contemporary studies, treatment-related mortality has been less than 5 percent, and long-term disease-free survival is between 40 and 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/35,47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,47-51</a>]. Although HDT is considered by many experts to be an appropriate second-line treatment for testicular and extragonadal NSGCTs, clinical trials in these patients often excluded men with poor prognostic features. Consequently, part of the apparent benefit from HDT compared with standard-dose chemotherapy may be attributable to patient selection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-risk-stratified-treatment-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial risk-stratified treatment for advanced testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Intermediate- and poor-risk advanced disease'</a>.)</p><p>Interpretation of the data from studies is complicated by the use of different HDT regimens and heterogeneous patient inclusion criteria. The conflicting data on the role of HDT are illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No benefit from HDT was seen in a European trial (IT-94) in which 280 men who relapsed after first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to four cycles of <span class=\"nowrap\">VIP/VeIP</span> (chemotherapy alone), or three cycles of <span class=\"nowrap\">VIP/VeIP</span> followed by consolidation using one cycle of HDT, which consisted of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (CEC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Moreover, only 73 percent of the patients assigned to the HDT arm actually received HDT, another finding that throws doubt on the benefit of giving three cycles of VeIP or VIP prior to HDT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most extensive observational data come from an international, multicenter series of 1594 patients with GCTs who relapsed after treatment with a cisplatin-etoposide regimen and were treated with either HDT or conventional-dose chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There was marked heterogeneity in the HDT regimens used in the frequency with which HDT was used in different countries. Patients were classified into five prognostic categories, based upon histology, primary tumor site, response to first-line chemotherapy, progression-free interval, serum tumor markers, and sites of metastatic involvement. At a median follow-up of five years, the two-year progression-free survival rate for the entire series was significantly higher with HDT compared with conventional-dose therapy (50 versus 28 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.44), as was the five-year overall survival rate (53 versus 41 percent, HR 0.65). Analyses of progression-free survival and overall survival rates based upon prognostic classification found similar results in all groups. </p><p/><p>The differences between these two reports may reflect various biases inherent in an observational study or may reflect limitations in the specific regimen used in the European IT-94 trial, which included only one cycle of HDT given after three cycles of conventional-dose chemotherapy. </p><p>While the administration of a second cycle of high-dose chemotherapy may have contributed to improved outcomes in some series, a German randomized trial enrolled 216 men and randomly assigned them to treatment with either [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arm A &ndash; One cycle of standard-dose VIP chemotherapy followed by three cycles of high-dose EC chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>) or </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arm B &ndash; Three cycles of standard-dose VIP followed by one cycle of high-dose CEC chemotherapy </p><p/><p>The trial originally was designed to enroll 230 men, but was stopped due to excessive toxicity in Arm B.

Arm A was associated with significantly fewer treatment-related deaths compared with arm B (4 versus 16 percent, respectively). These deaths were predominantly associated with sepsis or cardiotoxicity. </p><p>Additional randomized trials comparing conventional-dose chemotherapy (eg, VeIP or TIP) with HDT as second-line chemotherapy treatment are needed, and one is underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Because a single course of HDT offered no advantage in the IT-94 trial, the central unanswered question is whether two or more courses of high-dose chemotherapy are superior to four cycles of standard-dose chemotherapy. At this time, if high-dose chemotherapy is used, at least two cycles should be administered, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> is the preferred regimen.</p><p>Surgery may also have a role in the management of patients who have residual masses after second-line chemotherapy.

Relapses that occur after two years are considered late relapses. Late relapses are more common in men who have received chemotherapy for disseminated disease (approximately 3 percent incidence) than in earlier-stage patients (&lt;1 percent incidence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Estimates of the frequency of late relapse come from a pooled analysis of publications between 1989 and 2006 that included 3700 men with nonseminomatous GCTs (NSGCTs) and 2200 with seminomas, which reported that the incidence of late relapse is 3.2 and 1.4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In addition, the sites of relapse were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late relapses from NSGCT occur most commonly in the retroperitoneum (50 percent), lungs (17 percent), mediastinum (9 percent), neck and supraclavicular region (6.5 percent), and pelvis (4.4 percent).

The lungs and pelvis were rarely involved (3.2 and 1.6 percent, respectively). In addition, approximately 5 percent of late seminoma relapses occurred in other locations. </p><p/><p>Serum tumor markers are useful in detecting late relapses: approximately 50 percent have elevated alpha fetoprotein (AFP), and approximately 25 percent have elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) at the time of late relapse.</p><p>The relative frequency and clinical outcomes of late relapses in patients with clinical stage I testicular GCTs managed with active surveillance are discussed separately.

The outcomes following treatment are illustrated by several large series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One single institution evaluated the outcomes following treatment for late relapses in 83 men (80 with NSGCTs, 3 with seminomas) who had been relapse-free for at least two years following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Two received no therapy, and 69 of the 81 treated patients were rendered free of disease by treatment, including 43 of the 49 who underwent surgery. With a median follow-up of 25 months, 38 (47 percent) were continuously free of disease following therapy. Of the 32 patients treated with chemotherapy alone, only five remained continuously disease-free.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 122 men with late relapse after initial therapy, 42 of 48 seminomas (88 percent) but only 35 of 72 patients with NSGCTs (48 percent) were alive and without evidence of disease at last follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For patients with NSGCTs, the highest cure rate (50 percent) was achieved among those who underwent surgery as a component of their treatment. For seminomas, chemotherapy alone was effective in over one-half of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a separate institutional series of 75 patients (70 with NSGCTs), the five-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Patients who had not been treated previously with chemotherapy also had a better outcome (five-year CSS 93 versus 49 percent). In a multivariable analysis, unifocal disease and the absence of symptoms were associated with longer CSS.</p><p/><p>Lifetime follow-up is necessary for men who achieve disease-free status after a late relapse because of the high frequency of second relapses. In a follow-up series based upon 37 men with late relapse, 9 of the 19 who achieved no evidence of disease (NED) status relapsed a second time, including five with a second late relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Based upon these and other observations, the following generalizations can be made about late relapses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than one-half of late relapses occur more than five years after completing chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/25,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for late relapse include poor-prognosis disease at initial diagnosis, bulky retroperitoneal disease, and prior early relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most late relapses are malignant, although 10 to 20 percent are teratomas. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 30 and 50 percent of late relapses are associated with normal serum tumor markers. This has led some to advocate long-term annual radiographic surveillance for all patients with a history of GCTs. It is worth noting that the benefit of long-term surveillance computed tomography (CT) scans has not been demonstrated. A population-based study of 1949 men with GCTs reported late relapses in 25, of whom only 11 were asymptomatic at the time relapse was detected. Of those 11, only one had relapse detected initially on CT scans, while the others were diagnosed on physical exam, serum tumor markers, or chest radiograph. Different studies have reported conflicting results on whether patients who are asymptomatic at the time relapse is detected have a better prognosis compared with symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/24-26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26,28</a>]. Therefore, the use of long-term radiologic surveillance for all patients with GCTs is controversial; some experts believe that surveillance should be tailored to the individual patient's risk. Ideally, the benefit of surveillance should be weighed against the risk of second malignancies from the radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/25,28,29,54,55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,29,54,55,57</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An aggressive surgical approach should be adopted in patients who have late relapse, especially for men with NSGCT.

In patients with NSGCTs, residual masses should be resected following chemotherapy.
