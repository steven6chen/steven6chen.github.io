Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) denotes the selective removal of a patient&rsquo;s plasma and replacement with another fluid; cytapheresis refers to selective removal of abnormal or excessive numbers of blood cells.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the complications of therapeutic apheresis. An overview of the terminology used to describe apheresis procedures; the types of indications for which therapeutic apheresis is effective, including American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) therapeutic categories; and practical issues in apheresis techniques are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An overview to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction is also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic premise of therapeutic apheresis is that removal of certain pathologic substances (or cells, in cytapheresis) will reduce organ or tissue damage and may permit reversal of a pathologic process. In order to prevent volume depletion during therapeutic plasmapheresis, the volume of plasma removed must be replaced by plasma, colloid, or crystalloid. In some cases, use of allogeneic (donor) plasma is preferred because it provides needed proteins or other factors; however, donor plasma should be avoided if possible, other than when it is indicated as replacement fluid, such as for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, in which it provides needed proteins or other factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;, section on 'Replacement fluids'</a>.)</p><p>The frequency and types of complications from therapeutic apheresis depends upon the overall condition of the patient, the number of procedures, the replacement fluid, and the venous access device. A review of the reported complications from over 15,000 therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) treatments found that adverse reactions were substantially more common with plasma than with albumin replacement (20 versus 1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Patients undergoing therapeutic cytapheresis will only have selected cells removed. For erythrocytapheresis, red blood cells (RBC) are used as replacement. Most other types of cytapheresis require minimal or no replacement, depending on the volume of cells removed and the patient's ability to tolerate the procedure.</p><p>For all therapeutic apheresis, patients may be at risk for citrate-induced hypocalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, or complications related to the vascular catheter. When blood products (either plasma or RBCs) are used as replacement, the risk for citrate-related complications is higher due to citrate in blood components. In addition, patients who receive blood products as replacement are at risk for transfusion reactions and transfusion transmitted diseases. For therapeutic plasma exchange, when albumin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> crystalloid is used as the replacement fluid, patients may also be at risk for depletion of coagulation factors or immunoglobulins.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Any replacement fluid</strong> &ndash; A common issue is citrate-induced symptoms of hypocalcemia, due to binding of ionized (free) calcium by citrate, which is used as an anticoagulant during the procedure. Symptoms include paresthesias, nausea and vomiting, muscle cramps, chest pain, hypotension, and, in the extreme, tetany or arrhythmias such as QT prolongation.

Citrate binds to ionized calcium to form soluble <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a>, thereby lowering the ionized (and possibly total) serum calcium concentrations. In patients with normal liver function, citrate is generally metabolized within approximately 1.5 hours. However, because of the duration of most therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) or RBC exchange procedures, symptoms of citrate toxicity frequently occur.</p><p>Potential early symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral and distal extremity paresthesias or numbness. Severe reactions can include tetany, prolongation of the QT interval, arrhythmias, or hypotension.

Immediately after a single plasma volume exchange, the prothrombin time (PT) may increase by 30 percent and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may double; these changes tend to return towards normal within four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. However, more severe and long-lasting changes can be induced when multiple exchanges are performed over a short period (eg, three or more treatments per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>If a patient is expected to require multiple TPE procedures, a baseline assessment of coagulation status by measuring the PT, aPTT, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrinogen level should be done prior to initiating TPE; this may be repeated daily or every other day thereafter. For patients at risk of bleeding (eg, immediately after renal biopsy for anti-GBM disease), one or more liters of plasma (three to four units of plasma per liter) may be substituted as the replacement fluid; the plasma should be administered at the end of the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546395\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoglobulin depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeated TPE with a non-plasma replacement fluid will predictably deplete the patient's immunoglobulins, resulting in low serum IgG levels. The need for monitoring serum IgG levels depends upon a number of factors, including how frequently the exchanges are performed, how many blood volumes are exchanged with each procedure, the immune status of the patient, and the patient's ability to produce immunoglobulins.</p><p>Removal of immunoglobulins and complement may lead to an immunodeficient state, leaving the patient susceptible to infection. Reports of patients treated with TPE for glomerulonephritis suggested an increase in opportunistic infections; however, these patients also received immunosuppressive agents and were often granulocytopenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a trial that randomized 86 patients with lupus nephritis to TPE or immunosuppressive therapy, TPE was not associated with a greater risk of infection and patients were not more prone to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>For a patient undergoing aggressive TPE (eg, two to three plasma volumes replaced per procedure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consecutive daily procedures) without plasma replacement, a baseline IgG level should be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. For patients whose IgG level falls below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> who have a systemic infection, or for whom concerns about infection exist, we use a single infusion of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG, 100 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> although IgG replacement has not been tested in this setting.

In one report of 299 consecutive patients undergoing TPE, these symptoms occurred in all 14 patients receiving an ACE inhibitor versus only 7 percent of those not receiving an ACE inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The etiology of these symptoms is unclear; one possibility is increased kinin generation, which has been thought to account for the angioedema that can occur with ACE inhibitors.

Management is supportive. If future TPE is required, a different lot of albumin should be used, as kinin concentrations vary among albumin lots.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546951\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR PLASMA OR RED BLOOD CELL EXPOSURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546958\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaphylactic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylactic reactions to plasma are the most common cause of serious complications and death associated with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) using plasma as a replacement fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>].

Anticoagulant volumes are controlled by state-of-the-art cell separators.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Very rarely, dyspnea, wheezing, chest pain, and hypotension unresponsive to fluid boluses may be produced by complement-mediated membrane bioincompatibility or sensitivity to the ethylene oxide used as a membrane sterilant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypotension</strong> &ndash; Causes of hypotension include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Citrate-induced hypocalcemia can occur with any replacement fluid. (See <a href=\"#H544349\" class=\"local\">'Citrate-induced hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased intravascular volume may occur due to extracorporeal volume during the procedure, which is generally around 200 mL, but depends on the configuration of the apheresis kit. The extracorporeal volume of each kit type can be found in the manufacturer's information. With continuous flow technology, the extracorporeal volume is usually no more than 15 percent of the patient's intravascular volume; however, instrumentation that utilizes discontinuous flow technology may have higher extracorporeal volumes. Infusing additional intravascular fluid, slowing the procedure, or increasing the return rate can return the blood pressure toward the baseline level if hypotension is related to fluid shifts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An acute coronary syndrome may present with hypotension and chest pain. If the patient has chest pain, the procedure should be stopped and an electrocardiogram obtained to evaluate for an acute coronary syndrome.

Lowering the patient's head, using ammonium salts, and stopping the procedure temporarily are the appropriate in this setting. Modest fluid boluses with normal saline can also improve the patient's symptoms.

In more than 50 TPE-associated deaths since 1989, respiratory or cardiac complications were most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Cardiac arrhythmias were frequently observed, especially in those receiving plasma; the suspected etiology was a reduced ionized calcium concentration but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been proven.</p><p>Among respiratory deaths, acute respiratory distress and symptoms of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema were observed shortly before death; these patients were also being infused with plasma. Anaphylaxis, vascular complications, hepatitis, sepsis, and thrombosis were other, less common causes of death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16026803\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In order to prevent volume depletion during therapeutic apheresis, the removed plasma must be replaced by a replacement fluid, which may be allogeneic plasma, colloid, or crystalloid. The frequency and types of complications from therapeutic apheresis depend on the overall condition of the patient, the number of plasma exchanges, the replacement fluid, and the venous access device. Adverse reactions are more common when plasma is used as the replacement fluid. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Citrate causes hypocalcemia by binding to ionized calcium. Citrate-induced hypocalcemia can occur with any replacement fluid in therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and red blood cell (RBC) exchange, and symptoms of citrate toxicity can occur frequently. Potential early symptoms include perioral and distal extremity paresthesias or numbness; severe reactions can include tetany, prolongation of the QT interval, arrhythmias, or hypotension. A variety of strategies exist to reduce this complication. (See <a href=\"#H544349\" class=\"local\">'Citrate-induced hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other complications that can occur with any replacement fluid include metabolic alkalosis, inadvertent removal of a medication, or complications related to the vascular access catheter. (See <a href=\"#H544867\" class=\"local\">'Citrate-induced metabolic alkalosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H545225\" class=\"local\">'Inadvertent removal of a medication'</a> above and <a href=\"#H545251\" class=\"local\">'Vascular catheter complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-plasma replacement fluids may cause hypokalemia or depletion of coagulation factors or immunoglobulins. Baseline assessment of the PT, aPTT, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrinogen level should be done prior to initiating apheresis for patients expected to undergo multiple procedures, and a baseline IgG level should be obtained for those expected to undergo aggressive plasma exchange. (See <a href=\"#H546349\" class=\"local\">'Coagulation factor depletion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H546395\" class=\"local\">'Immunoglobulin depletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing, hypotension, abdominal cramping, and other gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported, although rarely, during TPE in patients receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. To reduce this complication, it has been recommended that ACE inhibitors be withheld for 24 hours prior to TPE if the patient can tolerate a short-term interruption. (See <a href=\"#H546467\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-related complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to donor plasma or RBC may cause anaphylactic reactions, allergic reactions (eg, hives), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), or exposure to infectious pathogens (see <a href=\"#H546951\" class=\"local\">'Donor plasma or red blood cell exposure'</a> above).
