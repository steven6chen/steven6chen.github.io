However, their role as agents of human disease was not recognized until 1987. Since then, the number of ehrlichiae recognized to cause human disease has rapidly expanded, as has our knowledge about the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of the diseases caused by these organisms. </p><p>The biology of ehrlichiae will be reviewed in this topic. A discussion of the diseases caused by these bacteria is presented separately.

A detailed discussion of Rickettsiaceae is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of Rickettsia rickettsii infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The current configuration of the genus Anaplasmataceae provides for four to five clades that represent individual genera: <em>Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Neoehrlichia, Neorickettsia, </em>and<em> Wolbachia</em>. These Anaplasmataceae can be divided into tick and non-tick transmitted bacteria: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick-transmitted &ndash; All members of the genera <em>Ehrlichia, Anaplasma</em>, and<em> Neoehrlichia </em>are transmitted by the bites of ticks.

The most important causes of human disease are members of the genera <em>Ehrlichia</em> and <em>Anaplasma</em>. The majority of recognized human infections are caused by <em>E. chaffeensis</em> and <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The white-tailed deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>) is the major reservoir host for <em>E. chaffeensis.</em> The natural cycle of <em>E. chaffeensis</em> involves lone star ticks (<em>Amblyomma americanum</em>), which may transmit to and acquire the organism from infected deer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major reservoir host for human-infective strains of<em> A. phagocytophilum</em> is generally a small mammal, such as the white-footed mouse (<em>Peromyscus leucopus</em>). <em>P. leucopus</em> is also the host for the tick vector in North America, <em>Ixodes scapularis</em>. Similar small <span class=\"nowrap\">mammal/tick</span> associations are seen with the related vectors <em>I. pacificus </em>(North America), <em>I. ricinus </em>and<em> I. persulcatus </em>(Europe and Asia),<em> </em>and<em> Haemaphysalis</em> species (Asia). Some variant strains of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> that infect deer do not infect mice or humans but may be transmitted by <em>Ixodes</em> species ticks. While ticks often have a preference for a specific host, many are promiscuous in their feeding behavior and readily bite humans.</p><p/><p>Other species that cause human infection include: <em>E. ewingii </em>(which has a natural life cycle and tick vector similar to <em>E. chaffeensis</em>); <em>E. muris</em>; the Panola Mountain <em>Ehrlichia</em>; <em>A. capra</em>; <em>A. ovis</em>; <em>Candidatus</em>,<em> </em>Neoehrlichia mikurensis (a cause of an emerging potentially severe febrile disease found in Europe and Asia);<em> </em>and <em>Neorickettsia sennetsu</em>. Although evidence for human disease related to <em>Wolbachia</em> endosymbionts in filariasis exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], direct infection of humans has not been definitively identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H918211360\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF ANAPLASMATACEAE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2063131974\"><span class=\"h2\">General characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ehrlichiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that grow within membrane-bound vacuoles in human and animal leukocytes. In humans, either monocytes (human monocytic ehrlichiosis) or granulocytes (human granulocytic anaplasmosis and <em>Ehrlichia ewingii</em> ehrlichiosis) can be infected. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Taxonomy and phylogeny'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3243046541\" class=\"local\">'Cell specificity'</a> below.) </p><p>Once infected, ehrlichiae replicate within modified vacuoles in the cytoplasm of the host cell. A microcolony of ehrlichiae within a vacuole is called a morula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61249%7EID%2F50113\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61249 graphicRef50113 \">picture 1A-B</a>), and organisms in these morulae differentiate into both replicative &quot;reticulate&quot; forms and infectious but nonreplicative &quot;dense-core&quot; forms, similar to forms described for <em>Chlamydia</em> species. Ehrlichiae differ from rickettsiae, which escape the endocytic vacuole to live freely in the cell cytoplasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of Rickettsia rickettsii infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The genomes of<em> Ehrlichia</em> and <em>Anaplasma</em> species lack genes for peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as suggested by their very simple cell wall ultrastructure. Their genomes also encode paralogous genes for major surface antigenic proteins that are both ligands by which the bacteria bind to host cells before entry, or that contribute to antigen variation and immune evasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Likewise, both genera possess structurally unusual but functional type IV secretion systems that translocate bacterial proteins into the host cell. These bacterial effector proteins: (1) trigger signaling in the host cell to induce modifications of the cell cytoskeleton that permit pathogen endocytic entry; (2) alter intracellular trafficking of vacuoles to avoid lysosome fusion; or (3) travel to the cell nucleus and alter host cell transcriptional programs and functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Ehrlichiae are difficult to detect by light microscopy as single bacteria within a leukocyte; however, morulae are easily visualized when present within white blood cells. Ehrlichiae can be stained with Giemsa and Wright stains and by the Macchiavello method. Individual organisms are generally round but can be pleomorphic when visualized in tissue culture cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus far, ehrlichiae have only been cultured in eukaryotic cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1932155466\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individual organisms induce endocytic entry into host cell vacuoles where they grow, divide, and within a few days form small, tightly packed clusters observable as intracellular inclusions (morulae). These bacterial cells have an open chromatin configuration and are not highly infective. <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> and <em>E. chaffeensis</em> cells with condensed chromatin (dense-core cells) appear several days later. These dense-core cells express unique proteins APH_1235 (<em>A. phagocytophilum</em>) or TRP120 (<em>E. chaffeensis</em>) that are important for infectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Like rickettsiae, ehrlichiae and anaplasma will not grow in cell-free culture media.<em> E. chaffeensis</em> and <em>E. canis</em> can be propagated in canine blood monocytes and in monocyte, endothelial, and macrophage cell lines from murine, human, primate, and canine origin. <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> can be cultivated <em>in vitro</em> using human myeloid leukemia cell lines. All can be cultivated in tick embryo cell lines. Axenic growth has not been achieved for any species in the <em>Anaplasmataceae</em> family.</p><p>Growth <em>in vitro</em> can take one week to one month or longer to detect. The duration of the organism's viability in human-donated blood is unknown; transfusion-transmitted ehrlichial infection is known to occur, even with leukoreduced blood products, and organisms can be reisolated from spiked EDTA-anticoagulated blood stored at 4&ordm;C for 11 days for <em>E. chaffeensis</em> and stored for 18 days for <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The metabolism of ehrlichiae is primarily aerobic. Genes required for glycolysis are absent, but the presence of some intact metabolic pathways in their genomic repertoires suggests that <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> and <em>E. chaffeensis</em> can use simple substrates such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate for phospholipid and nucleotide synthesis. Carbon sources are proline and glutamine only, and the majority of amino acids must be imported from the host by membrane transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p><em>E. chaffeensis </em>and<em> A. phagocytophilum</em> evade intracellular defenses by detoxifying superoxide anions or by preventing assembly of phagocyte oxidase and by delaying normal cellular apoptosis. Many of the altered cellular functions in infected hosts are mediated by direct interactions of cellular proteins with microbial-secreted effector molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, there is evidence that microbial molecules that bind host nuclear DNA have a role in subsequent regulation of host cell gene transcription, ultimately altering cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/5,6,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1110010804\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigenic characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic cross-reactions between <em>E. chaffeensis</em> and <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> occur. In addition, antibodies in the convalescent sera of humans infected with <em>E. ewingii </em>react with antigens of both <em>E. chaffeensis</em> and <em>E. canis.</em></p><p>Cross-reactivity between the ehrlichial antigens and rickettsial antigens does not occur. Also, ehrlichiae do not elicit cross-reacting antibodies with <em>Proteus</em> antigens (Weil-Felix agglutinins).</p><p>All strains of <em>E. chaffeensis</em> and <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> have modest antigenic differences among strains that result from genetic variation, post-translational modifications, and perhaps variation in expression of the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">omp1/p28</em></span> and <em><span class=\"nowrap\">msp2/p44</em></span> multifamily genes encoded in their genomes. There are greater serologic differences among strains from distinct geographical regions; genetic diversity also varies by geographical region. These findings suggest that strain differences are in part genetically determined as well.</p><p>The <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> genome contains at least 100 genes encoding <span class=\"nowrap\">Msp2/p44</span>. As each organism expresses only a single Msp2 protein at a time, a population of organisms can produce substantial antigenic diversity and evade immune response by switching expression to an antigenically distinct paralog after negative selection by host immune response. Likewise, there are 22 tandemly arranged <em><span class=\"nowrap\">omp1/p28</em></span> genes on the circular genome of <em>E. chaffeensis</em> that are differentially expressed or undergo a variety of post-translational modifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>For some species, variable expression of surface proteins is likely one reason that certain ehrlichiae are capable of causing persistent infection in their natural coadapted hosts, such as ticks, small mammals, and deer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, little evidence exists to support the concept that these organisms are capable of causing persistent or chronic infection in humans. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3243046541\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell specificity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending upon the species, the <em>Ehrlichia</em> or <em>Anaplasma</em> that cause human disease can infect circulating granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes, or platelets, as well as tissue macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. Individual species of <em>Ehrlichia</em> characteristically have different, highly specific cellular tropisms <em>in vivo</em>. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>A. phagocytophilum</em></strong> &ndash; <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> infects mostly neutrophils. Binding and entry into host cells<em> in vitro </em>involves several surface-exposed molecules, including the multigene family major surface protein <span class=\"nowrap\">(Msp2/p44),</span> OmpA, Asp14, and AipA, mostly through interactions with neutrophil surface glycans and glycoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. This interaction permits introduction of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> protein AnkA via the type IV secretion apparatus that bridges the bacterial and cell membranes. AnkA interacts with and is phosphorylated by Abl-1 after cell entry. This interaction is critical for pathogen entry into the neutrophil vacuole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vacuoles that sustain replication of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> accumulate a range of bacterial-secreted proteins that probably play a role in intracellular survival, vacuole trafficking, and acquisition of nutrients. At least one <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> protein (AnkA), enters the nucleus where it alters gene expression programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>], perhaps including those that govern respiratory burst, apoptosis, and a proinflammatory response. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although monocytes resist infection by <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>, it is likely that induction of an innate immune response and activation of multiprotein oligomers (collectively called the inflammasome) within monocytes and macrophages together mediate the inflammatory response that is the clinical hallmark of human <em>A. phagocytophilum </em>infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>E. chaffeensis</em></strong> &ndash;<em> </em>Individual species of <em>Ehrlichia</em> characteristically have different, highly specific cellular tropisms <em>in vivo</em>. <em>E. chaffeensis </em>infects mostly monocytes and macrophages <em>in vivo</em>. As with <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>, it expresses specific surface adhesion proteins (eg, TRP120, EtpE) that mediate binding to monocyte and macrophage selectins or to DNase X in regions associated with lipid rafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Once within the vacuole, <em>E. chaffeensis</em> secretes protein effectors via its type IV secretion apparatus into the host cell that in turn influence intracellular signaling, vacuolar trafficking, and regulation of transcriptional programs that favor survival long enough for acquisition in a subsequent tick bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Other species, such as<em> Neorickettsia risticii,</em> infect intestinal epithelial cells in horses. In contrast, the host target cells for infection by the <em>E. muris</em>-like agent, the Panola Mountain <em>Ehrlichia</em>, Neoehrlichia mikurensis, and <em>Anaplasma capra</em> have not been specifically identified. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory-based investigation of pathogenetic mechanisms has primarily been focused on <em>E. chaffeensis </em>and<em> A. phagocytophilum</em> infections. Despite genetic, antigenic, and morphologic similarities, these studies suggest that disease mechanisms caused by these two pathogens are distinct. Thus, they are discussed separately below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533276188\"><span class=\"h2\">E. chaffeensis and human monocytic ehrlichiosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After introduction into the skin through a tick bite, <em>E. chaffeensis</em> likely spreads via the lymphatics or blood to mononuclear phagocyte-enriched tissues, such as blood, bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, and spleen. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis does not produce endothelial cell infection manifesting as vasculitis and thrombosis, which are the hallmarks of spotted fever rickettsial infections such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Other spotted fever group rickettsial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bone marrow aspirates in patients with <em>E. chaffeensis</em> infection demonstrate hypercellularity of all hematopoietic elements, despite clinical findings such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other histopathologic findings include: noncaseating granulomas or mononuclear phagocyte-rich infiltrates, sometimes with hemophagocytosis in bone marrow; focal hepatocellular apoptosis ranging from mild lobular hepatitis and cholestasis to severe hepatic lobular necrosis; hypercellularity and dissolution of follicular architecture in lymph nodes and spleen, including occasional regions of marked apoptosis or necrosis; and lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates in tissues including the meninges, brain, and pulmonary interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/23,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33-36</a>]. </p><p>The discordance between the marked degree of histopathologic injury that can occur in human monocytic ehrlichiosis and the relatively small burden of bacteria in tissues in infected hosts suggests that human disease is secondary to immunopathologic mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This is supported by studies in murine models of infection, where infection leads to marked increases in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production and diminished Th1 cytokine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, TNFa produced by natural killer T (NKT) and CD8 T lymphocytes results in killing of CD4 T cells, and therefore reduced production of IFN-gamma, a key cytokine for control of intracellular <em>E. chaffeensis</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. <em>E. chaffeensis</em> may also directly modulate host defense genes of the infected macrophage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533276195\"><span class=\"h2\">A. phagocytophilum and human granulocytic anaplasmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a tick bite, <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> gains access to neutrophils that are recruited to the site of the bite before entering the vasculature and disseminating hematogenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thereafter, infected cells predominantly remain in the intravascular compartment. </p><p><em>A. phagocytophilum</em> alters normal neutrophil cell functions and their intracellular transcriptional programs. As a result, infected neutrophils no longer bind to or emigrate effectively through endothelial barriers and have defective phagocytic function and intracellular killing. However, infected neutrophils can still become activated, degranulate, and produce proinflammatory responses and chemokines that recruit new inflammatory host cells to sustain infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>The histopathologic findings seen in human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) include: normocellular to hypercellular bone marrow, despite leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; periportal lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates with focal lobular hepatic lesions and hepatocyte apoptosis (explaining increased serum hepatic transaminase activities); increased splenic red pulp cellularity and focal splenic necrosis; mild to moderate interstitial pneumonitis; and pulmonary hemorrhage. Erythrophagocytosis is occasionally observed in spleen, bone marrow, and liver sinusoids, but vasculitis, granulomas, and meningeal inflammation are rare or absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Some of the clinical findings (fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) and histologic features (lymphohistiocytic infiltrates) seen in HGA are suggestive of the macrophage activation or hemophagocytic syndrome. As an example, a study of 29 patients with HGA showed that the severity of disease in infected patients was correlated with higher serum levels of triglycerides, ferritin, interleukin-12 p70, and interleukin-10:IFN-gamma ratios compared with matched, uninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, several patients with severe disease fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for macrophage activation syndrome. While defects in CD8 T cell, NK, or NKT cell function have not yet been clearly demonstrated <em>in vivo</em>, animal studies provide evidence of their participation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-ehrlichiae/abstract/27,29,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,43</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Taxonomy and phylogeny'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual species of Anaplasmatacea infect a wide range of hosts, and disease can be recognized in humans, dogs, cats, sheep, goats, cattle, and horses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71243\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71243 \">table 1</a>). The most important causes of human disease are members of the genus <em>Ehrlichia</em> and <em>Anaplasma</em>. The majority of recognized human infections are caused by <em>E. chaffeensis</em> and <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>.<em> </em>(See <a href=\"#H2545557465\" class=\"local\">'Host specificity'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual ehrlichial organisms enter host cells by inducing endocytosis after introducing bacterial proteins into the host cells. The organisms redirect the vacuole from lysosome fusion by modifying intracellular trafficking to allow growth and division. Within a few days, small, tightly packed clusters of organisms are observable as intracellular inclusions mostly in leukocytes. (See <a href=\"#H918211360\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of Anaplasmataceae'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major target cells of <em>E. chaffeensis</em>, which causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis, are monocytes and macrophages. The major target cell of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>, which causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and for <em>E. ewingii</em> is the neutrophil.
