The lens is the part of the eye that focuses light (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76735\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76735 \">figure 1</a>). Cataracts can cause vision loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6373896\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cataracts?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cataracts make a person's vision blurry or dull (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78853 \">picture 1</a>). They can also make everything look slightly brown in color. Some people notice a problem when they keep needing new eyeglass prescriptions. For some, headlights and other lights might seem to have a glare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6373903\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for cataracts?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse might be able to see your cataracts just by looking in your eye. But if it looks like you have cataracts, your doctor or nurse will probably send you to an eye doctor. Eye doctors can usually diagnose cataracts in minutes.</p><p>If you have vision loss, it could be caused by more than one thing. An eye doctor can check you for the most common causes of vision loss by doing a &quot;comprehensive eye exam.&quot; During this exam, the doctor will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well you see things up close and far away</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well you see things that are at the center of focus and how well you see things that are off to the sides</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure the pressure inside your eye using a special device</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look into the back of your eyes to check for signs of nerve damage</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6373910\"><span class=\"h1\">How are cataracts treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for cataracts with major vision loss is surgery. This involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with a new artificial one. Not everyone needs treatment. If you have cataracts, it's up to you to decide if and when to have surgery.</p><p>Cataract surgery is pretty simple, but it can rarely lead to problems such as infection or pain. At the same time, the surgery can greatly improve vision in people with severe cataracts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6373917\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide about surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are thinking about surgery, ask your doctor these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of surgery for me? (If you have any other health problems, ask how they might affect the results of the surgery.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much is my vision likely to improve if I have the surgery?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it possible the surgery will <strong>not</strong> work?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are my cataracts the only thing causing my vision problems? (If you have other eye conditions, surgery might not help with those.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What will my recovery be like?</p><p/><p>If you need cataract surgery in both eyes, it will usually be done as 2 separate procedures on different days. Your surgeon will want to be sure that you have healed properly from the first surgery before doing the second one.</p><p>After you get all this information from your doctor, ask yourself:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much do my vision problems limit me?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can I do all the things I need to do with the vision I have left?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have I stopped doing things I love, such as reading or knitting, because I can't see well anymore?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How do I feel about the possible risks of surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How will I feel if the surgery causes problems or does not work?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will there be someone who can help me while I recover?</p><p/><p>Think it over. Then work with your doctor to decide whether surgery is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6373924\"><span class=\"h1\">Can cataracts be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting cataracts by not smoking or quitting if you already smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6374021\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-vision-loss-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related vision loss (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Open-angle glaucoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related macular degeneration (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetic retinopathy (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
