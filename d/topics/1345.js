Some blood gas analyzers also measure the methemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and hemoglobin levels. Such information is vital when caring for patients with critical illness, respiratory, or metabolic diseases. </p><p>The sites, techniques, and complications of arterial sampling and the interpretation of ABGs are reviewed here. Interpretation of venous blood gases and detailed discussion of acid-base disturbances are discussed separately.

Increased vessel compression is appropriate in such patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> or other antiplatelet agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) are not a contraindication for arterial vascular sampling in most cases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454078749\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CHALLENGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABG sampling may be difficult to perform in patients who are uncooperative or in whom pulses cannot be easily identified (eg, shock, vasopressor infusion, arteriosclerosis from end-stage kidney disease, calcification of the vessel wall). Difficulties can also arise when the patient cannot be positioned appropriately (eg, cannot fully extend the wrists for radial artery access due to tremor or joint contractures) or in obese or edematous patients with large amounts of subcutaneous tissue which may obscure the usual anatomic landmarks. In some of these scenarios, ultrasound may be useful to locate the artery and reduce potential complications of repeated puncture and consequent injury to the target vessel and surrounding tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTERIAL SAMPLING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial blood is required for an ABG. It can be obtained by percutaneous needle puncture or from an indwelling arterial catheter. Written consent is not usually required for arterial needle stick puncture but is required for the insertion of an indwelling catheter. Regardless, the risks and benefits of each procedure should be explained to the patient. </p><p>Ultrasound is not routinely used but can be used to direct access when sampling by the standard approach has been unsuccessful or is not feasible (eg, weak pulses, patient on multiple vasopressors, obese patients). When used, ultrasound-guided access may increase the operator's ability to enter the vessel and helps minimize injury to the artery and adjacent nerves and veins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle puncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous needle puncture refers to the withdrawal of arterial blood via a needle stick. It needs to be repeated every time an ABG is performed, since an indwelling catheter is not inserted. Thus, it is suitable for patients who require a limited number of arterial draws (eg, daily or less than once daily during an admission to hospital). If recurrent sampling (eg, more than four draws in 24 hours) is required, clinicians should, at minimum, rotate puncture sites (eg, right and left radial) or consider placing an indwelling catheter. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indwelling catheters'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-catheterization-techniques-for-invasive-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial catheterization techniques for invasive monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Site selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial step in percutaneous needle puncture is locating a palpable artery. Common sites include the radial, femoral, brachial, dorsalis pedis, or axillary artery. There is no evidence that any site is superior to the others. However, the radial artery is used most often because it is accessible and more comfortable for the patient than the alternative sites. The radial artery is also typically used for outpatients, while all sites can be used for inpatients who require an ABG.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radial artery</strong> &ndash; The radial artery is best palpated between the distal radius and the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis when the wrist is extended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55221 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82119\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82119 \">figure 2</a>). Although infrequently performed, the arm can be taped (at the level of the forearm and palm) to an armboard with the palm facing upward; a large roll of gauze also can be placed between the wrist and the armboard in a position that extends the wrist. Over extension should be avoided as extension of the overlying flexor tendons may make the pulse difficult to detect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brachial artery</strong> &ndash; The brachial artery is best palpated medial to the biceps tendon in the antecubital fossa, when the arm is extended and the palm is facing up (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57543 \">figure 3</a>). The arm is placed on a firm surface (an armboard can be used similar to that described for the radial artery above) with the shoulder slightly abducted, the elbow extended, and the forearm in full supination. The needle should be inserted just above the elbow crease at a 30 degree angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69312\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69312 \">figure 4</a>). It is usually harder to access because it runs deeper in the arm than the radial artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Femoral artery</strong> &ndash; The femoral artery is best palpated just below the midpoint of the inguinal ligament, when the lower extremity is extended and the patient is lying supine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75120\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75120 \">figure 5</a>). The needle should be inserted at a 90 degree angle just below the inguinal ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50204\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50204 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Axillary artery</strong> &ndash; The axillary artery is best palpated in the axilla, when the arm is abducted and externally rotated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55334\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55334 \">figure 7</a>). The needle should be inserted as high into the apex of the axilla as possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67106 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dorsalis pedis</strong> &ndash; The dorsalis pedis artery can be occluded by the forefinger followed by compression of the nail bed of the great toe and assessment of the rapidity with which color returns to the nail bed after pressure is released from the great toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54240 \">figure 9</a>). The needle can be inserted at a 30 degree angle lateral to the extensor tendon at the level of the midfoot. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Ensure collateral circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the risks associated with arterial puncture is ischemia distal to the puncture site (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below). Although rarely performed in practice, identifying collateral flow to the region supplied by the artery can be used by clinicians prior to puncture. While limited studies have found variable accuracy associated with such evaluations, we believe that patients, and in particular high risk patients, undergoing radial or dorsalis pedis artery puncture should have the collateral flow to those vessels evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Our belief is based upon the concept that it avoids potential harm by identifying patients who have impaired collateral circulation and who are therefore at increased risk of an ischemic complication, and in whom an alternative site should be sought. In addition, the evaluation can be performed quickly at the bedside and at no cost. </p><p>Radial and dorsalis pedis artery puncture are at highest risk of this complication (because they are small in diameter). They receive collateral supply from the ulnar and lateral plantar artery, respectively. It is this collateral supply that is identified by the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radial artery</strong> &ndash; The Allen's test or modified Allen's test are bedside tests that can be performed in patients undergoing radial artery puncture to demonstrate collateral flow from the ulnar artery through the superficial palmar arch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55221 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Modified Allen's test</strong> &ndash; The patient's hand is initially held high with the fist clenched. <strong>Both</strong> the radial and ulnar arteries are compressed firmly by the two thumbs of the investigator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70306 \">figure 10</a>). This allows the blood to drain from the hand. The hand is then lowered and the fist is opened (the palm will appear white). Overextension of the hand or wide spreading of the fingers should be avoided because it may cause false-normal results. The pressure is released from the ulnar artery while occlusion is maintained on the radial artery. A pink color should return to the palm, usually within six seconds, indicating that the ulnar artery is patent and the superficial palmar arch is intact. Although the timing of return of circulation to the palm varies considerably, the test is generally considered abnormal if ten seconds or more elapses before color returns to the hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79685 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>The Allen's test</strong> &ndash; The Allen's test (from which the modified Allen's test evolved) is performed identically, except these steps are executed twice: once with release of pressure from the ulnar artery while occlusion is maintained on the radial artery, and once with release of pressure from the radial artery while occlusion is maintained on the ulnar artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; Finger pulse plethysmography, Doppler flow measurements, and measurement of the arterial systolic pressure of the thumb have been described but are not routinely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dorsalis pedis artery</strong> &ndash; An Allen's<strong> </strong>test to assess the collateral circulation of the posterior tibialis is performed by elevating the leg until the plantar skin blanches followed by compression of dorsalis pedis pulse by the clinician's thumb and lowering of leg to dependency. The foot rapidly resumes its normal color if the posterior tibial artery flow is adequate.</p><p/><p>The risk of ischemic complications is low for the axillary artery because the arm receives good collateral flow through the thyrocervical trunk and subscapular artery. Thus, no collateral supply testing is typically performed prior to arterial puncture. However, assessing distal brachial and radial artery pulses is appropriate in patients who have had anatomic, pathologic abnormalities of the thoracic outlet; if distal pulses are weak, an alternative site should be sought. &#160;</p><p>The femoral artery is large such that ischemia is rare. However, the distal pedal pulses of the lower limb should be assessed first. If pedal pulses are severely diminished or absent, peripheral arterial disease may be present and an alternative arterial puncture site should be sought. </p><p>Similarly, pulses distal to the brachial artery must be assessed prior to the procedure. In patients with absent pulses at the wrist (ie, in the radial and ulnar arteries), an alternative site for arterial sampling should be sought.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454079094\"><span class=\"h3\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As for all procedures, the equipment necessary should be brought to the bedside prior to the procedure. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non sterile gloves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiseptic skin solution (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> and povidone-iodine are solutions)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ABG kit OR a pre-heparinized 3 mL ABG syringe with a 22 to 25-gauge needle and syringe cap</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2 &times; 2 inch sterile gauze </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesive bandage </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plastic hazard bag with ice (if not provided in the kit) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharp object container </p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a> (eg, 1 or 2 percent) without epinephrine may be required should the clinician feel that anesthesia is necessary or the patient requests it. </p><p>ABG kits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103744\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103744 \">picture 2</a>) are used by clinicians in most institutions to draw arterial blood. Kits contain a heparinized plastic syringe with the plunger already pulled back to allow for the collection of 2 mL of blood, a protective needle sleeve, a needle, syringe cap, and ice bag. The sleeve, while attached to the syringe, locks the needle within itself to prevent direct contact between operator and needle. It is removed to expose the needle. The prefilled heparin is expelled (incomplete dismissal of heparin falsely lowers the partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and the plunger is then repositioned at the 2 mL mark. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively a heparinized ABG syringe can be used. Approximately 2 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> heparin (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> can be aspirated into a syringe through a 22 to 25 gauge needle and then pushed out; the plunger should be left leaving a small empty volume (eg, usually 2 mL) in the syringe. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a palpable artery has been located, blood is withdrawn using the following steps. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The planned puncture site should be sterilely prepared. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local analgesia with injectable 1 to 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> can be administered but is not usually performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. If local anesthesia is employed (eg, requested by the patient, difficult or prolonged needle stick is pre-empted), 0.5 to 1 mL of the anesthetic is injected to create a small dermal papule at the site of puncture; using larger amounts or injecting the anesthetic into deeper planes may distort the anatomy and hinder identification of the vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Traditionally, it was believed that the injection of lidocaine is as painful as the procedure itself so many clinicians avoid using it for this reason. However, in our experience, when performed by personnel experienced in arterial draws, no anesthesia is typically needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ABG kits are used by clinicians in most institutions to draw arterial blood. Alternatively, a heparinized syringe can be used. The kit or syringe is prepared as described above. (See <a href=\"#H454079094\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or two fingers should be used to gently palpate the artery while holding the needle in the other hand. Both fingers should be proximal to the desired puncture site; placing the nondominant middle finger distally and the nondominant index finger proximally, with the needle insertion site in between, is not recommended, because of the increased risk of needle stick injury. The artery should be punctured with the needle at a 30 to 45 degree angle (radial, brachial, axillary, dorsalis pedis) or at a 90 degree angle (femoral artery) relative to the skin. The syringe fills on its own (ie, pulling the plunger is usually unnecessary). Approximately 2 to 3 mL of blood should be removed. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with poor distal perfusion (eg, hypovolemia, shock, vasopressor therapy) who may exhibit a weak arterial pulse, the operator may need to pull back the syringe plunger, although this increases the risk of venous blood sampling. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If arterial flow is lost during the arterial draw, the needle may have moved outside the vessel lumen. The needle may be pulled back slightly and repositioned to a point just below the skin; subsequent redirection using the maneuver described above should be attempted to re-access the artery. Multiple blind or stabbing movements of the needle while it is inserted deeply in the patient's limb should be avoided since this increases the risk of local injury and pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After withdrawing a sufficient volume of blood, the needle should be removed while simultaneously applying pressure to the puncture site with sterile gauze until hemostasis is achieved. This usually takes five minutes in a non-anticoagulated patient; avoid checking the puncture site until local pressure has been maintained for at least this period as this increases the risk of hemorrhage or a hematoma. In patients who have a coagulopathy or are on anticoagulation therapy, it may be necessary to apply local pressure for a longer time. Once hemostasis is achieved, apply an adhesive bandage over the puncture site. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When ABG kits are used, apply the needle protective sleeve then untwist the sleeve and place it in the sharp object container. When an ABG syringe is used, recap, remove, and discard the needle, being careful to avoid a needle stick injury. After discarding the needle, remove the excess air in the syringe by holding it upright and gently tapping it, allowing any air bubbles present to reach the top of the syringe, from where they can then be expelled. Cap the syringe, roll it between the hands for a few seconds to allow blood to mix with the heparin (prevents clotting), then place on ice in the hazard bag and send it for analysis. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454078833\"><span class=\"h3\">Postprocedural care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be monitored for new symptoms such as skin color changes, persistent or worsening pain, active bleeding, and impaired movement or sensation of the limb. Monitoring is particularly important in patients who are subsequently supra therapeutic on anticoagulants or are given thrombolytics, as bleeding may be observed in such patients even though the needle stick occurred a few hours prior. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, serious complications due to arterial percutaneous needle puncture are rare.</p><p>Common complications of ABG sampling include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local pain and paresthesia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local minor bleeding</p><p/><p> Less common complications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasovagal response </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local hematoma from moderate or major bleeding </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Artery vasospasm </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rare complications include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection at the puncture site</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial occlusion from a local hematoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air or thrombus embolism </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local anesthetic anaphylactic reaction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local nerve injury </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needle stick injury to health care personnel (limited due to use of ABG kits)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudoaneurysm formation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vessel laceration </p><p/><p>Should local bleeding, hematoma, vasospasm, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial thrombus be severe, compartment syndrome and limb ischemia can occur. Compartment syndrome may manifest as pain, paresthesias, pallor, and absence of pulses. Limb skin color changes, absent pulses, and distal coldness may be seen in ischemic injury. Although unproven, rotating puncture sites and placing firm pressure on the puncture site for at least five minutes after each arterial draw is thought to decrease the risk of these complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>While vasopressor use may increase the risk of vasospasm, when indicated (eg, for shock), these agents should not be adjusted to avoid or treat this complication.

Indwelling catheters provide continuous access to arterial blood, which is helpful when frequent blood gases are needed (eg, patients in respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, patients requiring serial ABGs for monitoring acid-base disorders). The sample preparation and care is the same as for ABGs drawn using a needle, which is described above.

Paresthesias of the hands, feet or mouth may also be present due to peripheral hypocalcemia (from increased binding of calcium to serum albumin). Patients may also complain of chest pain or dyspnea and severe cases can be associated with carpopedal spasm, tetany, mental confusion, syncope, and seizures. Acute hypocapnia causes a reduction of serum levels of potassium and phosphate secondary to increased intracellular shifts of these ions. Hyponatremia and hypochloremia are rare.

However, the clinical significance of this error is minimal if the sample is placed on ice and analyzed within 15 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. While using a glass syringe will prevent gas diffusion, this solution is impractical. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heparin that is added to the syringe as an anticoagulant can decrease the pH if acidic heparin is used and the dismissal of heparin from the syringe is incomplete. It can also dilute the PaCO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in a falsely low value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. When an ABG syringe is used, the amount of heparin solution used should be minimized and at least 2 mL of blood should be obtained. Detailed discussion of ABG equipment is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H454079094\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air bubbles that exceed 1 to 2 percent of the blood volume can cause a falsely high PaO<sub>2</sub> and a falsely low PaCO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The magnitude of this error depends upon the difference in gas tensions between blood and air, the exposure surface area (which is increased by agitation), and the time from specimen collection to analysis. The clinical significance of this error can be decreased by gently tapping on the syringe to remove the bubbles after the sample has been withdrawn and analyzing the sample as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies suggest that ABGs estimate the systemic acid-base balance and oxygenation but do not accurately reflect tissue levels in states of shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. As an example, one study of patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation compared blood gas values in blood simultaneously drawn from an arterial catheter and a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Compared with PAC samples, arterial pH was higher (7.42 versus 7.14) and PaCO<sub>2</sub> was lower (32 mmHg versus 74 mmHg). If PAC results more closely reflect the acid-base status at the tissue level, then the arterial measurements can lead to the mistaken assumption that acid-base balance in tissues is being maintained. However, measurement of ABGs from PACs to assess gas exchange is impractical (PACs are rarely placed) and not adequately validated such that it cannot be routinely recommended. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An arterial blood gas (ABG) is a test that measures the oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), acidity (pH), oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>), and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>) concentration in arterial blood. Some blood gas analyzers also measure the methemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and hemoglobin levels. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ABGs are frequently used to detect and monitor indices of oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base balance, as well as quantify levels of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. Absolute contraindications include an abnormal modified Allen's test, distorted anatomy, infection, or severe peripheral vascular disease at the puncture site. Arterial blood draws and in particular catheter insertion should be avoided in patients with severe coagulopathy or in whom thrombolytic therapy is being administered as well as in patients with active Raynaud's disease. Therapeutic anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> are not generally considered as contraindications to ABG needle stick sampling. (See <a href=\"#H454078742\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical challenges arise in patients who are uncooperative or in whom pulses cannot be easily identified (eg, shock, vasopressor use), as well as in patients who cannot be positioned appropriately (eg, joint contractures) or in obese or edematous patients when the usual anatomic landmarks are hard to identify. In such cases, ultrasound may be useful to locate the artery and reduce potential complications of repeated puncture and consequent injury to the target vessel. (See <a href=\"#H454078749\" class=\"local\">'Technical challenges'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous needle puncture refers to the withdrawal of arterial blood via a needle stick. It needs to be repeated every time an ABG is performed. Thus, it is suitable for patients who require a limited number of arterial draws (eg, daily or less than once daily during an admission to hospital). If recurrent sampling is required, clinicians should at minimum rotate puncture sites (eg, right and left radial) or consider placing an indwelling catheter (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Arterial sampling'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Common sites include the radial, femoral, brachial, axillary, or dorsalis pedis artery. There is no evidence that any site is superior to the others. However, the radial artery is used most often because it is accessible and more comfortable for the patient than the alternative sites. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Site selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients undergoing radial or dorsalis pedis artery puncture, we suggest evaluating the collateral flow to those vessels prior to puncture (eg, modified Allen's test for radial artery puncture) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For other sites, distal pulses can be assessed prior to arterial puncture. Poor collateral flow or weak distal pulses should prompt arterial puncture at an alternate site. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Ensure collateral circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once the target artery has been identified, the planned puncture site should be sterilely prepared. Injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> is typically not used. The artery should be punctured with a small needle and syringe, 2 to 3 mL of blood should be withdrawn, and then the needle should be removed. Finally, pressure should be applied to the puncture site for five minutes or longer. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complications due to percutaneous needle puncture are rare, but include pain, bleeding, bruising, hematoma, nerve injury, and vasospasm.

The sample preparation and care is the same as for ABGs drawn using a needle.

(See <a href=\"#H620441822\" class=\"local\">'Oxygenation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H620441828\" class=\"local\">'Ventilation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H620441841\" class=\"local\">'Acid-base balance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H620441947\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal hemoglobins'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sources of error include gas diffusion (falsely low PaO<sub>2</sub>), incomplete dismissal of heparin (falsely low pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub>), and air bubbles (falsely high PaO<sub>2</sub> and a falsely low PaCO<sub>2</sub>). ABGs estimate the systemic acid-base balance but may not reflect the acid-base status at the tissue level in states of shock. (See <a href=\"#H710978436\" class=\"local\">'Sources of error'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arterial-blood-gases/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">AARC clinical practice guideline.
