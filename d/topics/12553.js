The world's oceans harbor hundreds of different types of marine toxins, and the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these toxins vary widely. Several of these toxins are produced by dinoflagellates or phytoplankton during algae or marine diatom blooms. Shellfish and pufferfish poisoning arise from consumption of seafood that is contaminated by various toxins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90120 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In most instances the ingested seafood smells, appears, and tastes normal. Clinical features of the most common forms of shellfish or pufferfish poisoning typically develop within minutes to hours of ingestion. A food history that identifies ingestion of seafood commonly associated with the specific toxin, clinical features consistent with the specific poisoning, and detection of elevated levels of the toxin in the ingested seafood provides the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive.</p><p>An overview of paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, diarrheic shellfish poisoning, and pufferfish poisoning is provided here. Scombroid (histamine) poisoning, ciguatera fish poisoning and marine envenomations, such as coral abrasions and sea urchin injuries, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scombroid-histamine-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scombroid (histamine) poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciguatera-fish-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ciguatera fish poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=marine-envenomations-from-corals-sea-urchins-fish-or-stingrays\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Marine envenomations from corals, sea urchins, fish, or stingrays&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISONING</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> &ndash; Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) occurs after ingestion of shellfish contaminated with neurotoxins formed by algae, primarily saxitoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It has been linked to algal blooms called &quot;red tides,&quot; even though it can occur in the absence of red tides. PSP primarily occurs in temperate climates, although it has been described in shellfish from tropical waters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Potential vectors for PSP include bivalve mollusks (eg, cockles, salt- and fresh-water mussels, or <span class=\"nowrap\">butter/little</span> neck clams), gastropod mollusks (eg, whelk, moon snails, or abalone), crustaceans (eg, Dungeness crabs, shrimp, or lobsters), pufferfish (saxitoxin pufferfish poisoning), and zooplanktivorous fish (eg, Atlantic salmon, herring, and mackerel) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Of these, outbreaks of human disease are most commonly associated with salt-water bivalve mollusks, especially mussels or clams.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PSP has been described worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the United States, PSP primarily occurs in seafood harvested from the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and Alaskan waters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, from 2010 to 2011, there was a marked increase in the number of PSP cases in southeast Alaska, all of which stemmed from the ingestion of non-commercially harvested shellfish (specifically, cockles, blue mussels, <span class=\"nowrap\">butter/little</span> neck clams, and Dungeness crabs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A subsequent CDC report noted that non-commercially-harvested Alaskan shellfish can have high levels of PSP toxin at any time of year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Clinicians were urged to report suspected cases to health officials and to collect and freeze patient urine and shellfish samples (if available) for testing. In contrast, commercial shellfish are routinely monitored for PSP toxin in Alaska and are safe to consume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> &ndash; The toxins that cause PSP are formed by dinoflagellates of the genus <em>Alexandrium</em> and are collectively known as saxitoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>]. These toxins are taken up by seafood vectors, most commonly, bivalve mollusks such as mussels, clams, scallops, and oysters, as well as by crabs and snails, with no apparent ill effect. The PSP toxins are not destroyed by heat, marinating, or freezing. Contaminated seafood smells, tastes, and appears normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; In humans, the PSP toxins block sodium ion channels and rapidly cause neurologic symptoms ranging from perioral tingling, ataxia, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, paresthesias, weakness to paralysis, brainstem dysfunction, and respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/4,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,9</a>]. Onset of symptoms ranges from a few minutes to approximately four hours. In untreated patients, the case fatality rate is as high as 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and death may occur within 2 to 12 hours of seafood ingestion of contaminated seafood. With proper supportive care, most patients survive. Neurotoxic symptoms tend to improve gradually after 12 hours and are resolve completely within a few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A working diagnosis of paralytic shellfish poisoning is made when there is a history of consumption of a known seafood vector of PSP followed by the onset of neurologic symptoms, including paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Frequently ingestion of a noncommercial harvest of shellfish or crabs is noted and a cluster of cases is identified. The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of saxitoxin in the urine of affected patients or samples of the seafood. The local health department should be contacted to assist with laboratory confirmation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Differential diagnosis </strong>&ndash; Other foodborne illnesses, such as tetrodotoxin pufferfish poisoning, botulism, and ciguatera fish poisoning have clinical presentations that are similar to PSP. Careful food history accompanied by the detection of saxitoxins in the urine or contaminated seafood helps to distinguish PSP from these entities. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Pufferfish poisoning (tetrodotoxin)'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciguatera-fish-poisoning#H3603730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ciguatera fish poisoning&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;, section on 'Foodborne botulism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment and prevention</strong> &ndash; Treatment is primarily supportive, and mechanical ventilation is important for severely affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Prevention is dependent upon close monitoring of shellfish beds by health authorities, notification of the public when contaminated shellfish are found, and avoidance of shellfish beds that have been closed to harvesting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROTOXIC SHELLFISH POISONING</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> &ndash; Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) is also associated with &quot;red tides.&quot; NSP tends to occur along the southeastern coast of the United States and in addition, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Between 1998 and 2002, there were two outbreaks reported to the CDC in the United States that affected four persons, none of whom died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> &ndash; The NSP-related toxins are formed by the dinoflagellate species <em>Karenia brevis</em> (formerly <em>Gymnodidium breve</em> and <em>Ptychodiscus brevis</em>), which produces both hemolytic toxins and neurotoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. These toxins, called brevetoxins, are taken up by bivalve shellfish and are also aerosolized during algal blooms. Brevetoxins increase sodium ion channel permeability. They also inhibit cathepsins, lysosomal proteinases that are found in phagocytes such as macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; NSP is diagnosed clinically based upon the history of exposure and typical physical findings in association with a red tide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">NSP has been associated with two clinical syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ingestion</strong> &ndash; After eating contaminated shellfish, gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) and neurologic symptoms such as paresthesias of the face, mouth, and extremities, dizziness, ataxia, and muscle aches develop within 30 minutes to three hours. Patients may also experience temperature-related dysesthesias (sometimes described as <span class=\"nowrap\">hot/cold</span> temperature reversal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In severe cases, paralysis, coma, and seizures have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Inhalation</strong> &ndash; The other syndrome, aerosolized red tide respiratory irritation (ARTRI), occurs when the toxins are inhaled from sea spray and consists of nasal and respiratory irritation, rhinorrhea, and bronchoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. People with chronic lung disease and asthma are especially susceptible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong> &ndash; For patients who have ingested neurotoxic shellfish, fluid repletion is important. Antiemetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>) may also be helpful. Although evidence is lacking regarding improved outcomes, activated charcoal administration to bind unabsorbed food is advocated by some experts because of the potential for serious adverse outcomes despite appropriate supportive care. In mild cases, toxic effects typically resolve fully within a few days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Inhaled bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>) are useful for treatment and possibly also for prevention of aerosolized red tide respiratory irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">NSP is generally not fatal in humans and most patients recover within 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, brevetoxins do exact a heavy toll on marine and bird life including large scale deaths of fish and manatees.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">DIARRHEIC SHELLFISH POISONING</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology </strong>&ndash; Diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) occurs throughout the world. Major outbreaks, primarily associated with contaminated mussels, have occurred in Japan, China, Scandinavia, France, Belgium, Spain, Chile, Uruguay, Ireland, the United States, and Canada. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/2,3,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,16-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> &ndash; Several toxins have been associated with DSP, of which the best known is okadaic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is lipid soluble and acts as an inhibitor of certain types of phosphorylation in mammalian cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation and management</strong> &ndash; A case definition of DSP would include chills and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps shortly after eating bivalve mollusks, especially mussels and scallops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The symptoms usually occur within two hours after shellfish consumption and resolve within two to three days. The presence of okadaic acid or one of the other DSP-associate toxins confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning has many clinical features in common with other types of foodborne illness, including poisoning from some types of mushroom and food contamination by a variety of bacterial organisms. A food history that indicates ingestion of bivalve mollusks from a region associated with DSP and isolation of okadaic acid or one of the other associated toxins from the contaminated food helps to distinguish it from other toxins or microbial contaminants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-mushroom-poisoning#H21621536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of mushroom poisoning&quot;, section on 'Acute gastroenteritis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings#H1823851406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Clinical clues to the microbial cause'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Management of diarrheic shellfish poisoning consists of fluid repletion and antiemetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>) for vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Okadaic acid is mutagenic in Chinese hamster lung cells and has been found to promote skin tumors in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The human health implications of this are unknown although shellfish consumption as a risk factor for colorectal cancer has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">PUFFERFISH POISONING (TETRODOTOXIN)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> &ndash; Pufferfish poisoning is most commonly seen in Japan where the fish, called fugu, globefish, or blowfish, is considered a delicacy. Sporadic cases have also been reported in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> &ndash; Pufferfish poisoning is caused by tetrodotoxin, a neurotoxin produced by microorganisms associated with the fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Tetrodotoxin is one of the deadliest natural toxins and is not destroyed by washing, cooking, or other food preparation. It concentrates in the liver and visceral organs along with the skin of the pufferfish and is also found in several species of frogs, salamanders, and octopus. Tetrodotoxin binds sodium channels, preventing sodium influx into nerve axons. It also acts on vascular smooth muscle and skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Saxitoxin, the cause of PSP, can also be found in pufferfish. Cases of neurologic symptoms, including numbness and tingling of the lips and mouth, have been reported to arise rapidly after the consumption of pufferfish caught in the area of Titusville, Florida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These symptoms generally resolve within hours to days, although one affected individual required intubation for 72 hours. Saxitoxin was confirmed by liquid chromatographic analysis. As a result of such cases, Florida banned the harvesting of pufferfish from certain bodies of water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Paralytic shellfish poisoning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Symptoms of tetrodotoxin pufferfish poisoning occur rapidly after ingestion and include weakness, dizziness, paresthesias of the face and extremities, nausea, and loss of reflexes. With higher doses there is severe hypotension and, in some cases, generalized paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Death can occur due to respiratory failure and hypotension. It is not unusual for the patient to remain conscious while paralyzed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management </strong>&ndash; Treatment of pufferfish poisoning consists of supportive care. Although evidence is lacking regarding improved outcomes, intestinal decontamination with gut lavage and activated charcoal if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion is advocated by many experts because of the seriousness of the poisoning and the potential for poor outcomes despite appropriate supportive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Case reports and series suggest that anticholinesterases such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a> may be effective in partially reversing paralysis in some but not all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER MARINE TOXINS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Amnesic shellfish poisoning</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> &ndash; Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) was first recognized in 1987 following an outbreak involving 107 persons (four died) who became ill after consuming contaminated mussels cultivated off the coast of Prince Edward Island, Canada. It is caused by a heat stable toxin called domoic acid, which is produced by single-celled, algae-like organisms called diatoms of the species <em>Pseudonitzschia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Subsequently domoic acid contamination of mussels, scallops, razor clams, or crustaceans have been described in Spain, Portugal, Scotland, Ireland, France, New Zealand, Australia, Belgium, and Chile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/3,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29</a>]. In California, domoic acid contamination of anchovies has resulted in erratic behavior and deaths of sea lions, pelicans, and cormorants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> &ndash; Domoic acid is structurally related to glutamate and acts as a powerful excitatory neurotransmitter that can cause the death of neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus. It is taken up by shellfish during harmful phytoplankton blooms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> &ndash; After ingestion by humans, contaminated shellfish cause diarrhea and abdominal cramps, followed by headache, memory loss, and disorientation. In severe cases, domoic acid ingestion can lead to diminished reflexes, ophthalmoplegia, coma, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Although evidence is lacking, some experts support administration of activated charcoal to bind any non-absorbed food given the potential for poor outcomes, including permanent short-term memory loss, despite appropriate supportive care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After the Canadian outbreak, limits on domoic acid concentration in shellfish were rapidly adopted at 20 micrograms per gram of shellfish flesh. These limits based upon the lowest concentrations in mussels found to cause symptoms (200 micrograms per gram of shellfish flesh) reduced by a factor of 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Clinical effects may present soon after exposure and include fever, headache, rash, eye irritation, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, wheezing, and neurologic symptoms (eg, paresthesias or confusion). Given the nonspecific nature of the presentation, the clinician must have a high degree of suspicion, especially in patients with unexplained neurologic findings, and ask about exposure to lake water in order to make the diagnosis.</p><p>Patients suspected of toxicity from harmful algal blooms should also be reported to the local department of public health to encourage investigation of the lake and prevent further exposures. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible estuary-associated syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Possible estuary-associated syndrome (PEAS) is believed to be a neurotoxin-mediated illness associated with exposure to waterways inhabited by dinoflagellates such as <em>Pfiesteria</em>. <em>Pfiesteria</em> has been found in the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River estuaries of North Carolina and in the Pocomoke River on Maryland's Eastern Shore [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. <em>Pfiesteria</em> is associated with ulcerative lesions on fish and fish kills.</p><p>Human laboratory workers and fishermen with PEAS have experienced respiratory and eye irritation, rashes, abdominal cramps and vomiting, and cognition and personality changes.

Ongoing studies are investigating long-term effects of PEAS and <em>Pfiesteria </em>exposure.

Palytoxin was originally described in Hawaii but more recently has caused health problems among home aquarium enthusiasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and after an algal bloom in Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It binds to and disables the <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/potassium</span> ATPase pump. Human exposure to palytoxin has been described following ingestion of crabs, fish, and shellfish that have fed on palytoxin-containing algae or coral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], inhalational exposure from corals in fish tanks or sea air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/37,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40-43</a>], and dermal or eye exposure after touching corals that elaborate the toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].</p><p>Inhalational exposure from soft corals in aquariums or sea air can produce conjunctivitis, chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, and bronchospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/39,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,47</a>]. Rarely, adult respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory failure may occur. Treatment is supportive with administration of antihistamines, inhaled bronchodilators, and systemic corticosteroids. </p><p>Although rare, ingestion of contaminated seafood (algae- and reef-feeding fish, crustaceans, and shellfish) can produce neurologic symptoms of paresthesias, weakness, severe uncontrollable muscle cramping (potentially leading to rhabdomyolysis), and hot-cold reversal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

In all cases, it is important for the clinician to work closely with local public health authorities. Clinicians should also remember that while marine toxin-induced diseases are not uncommon, food poisoning from infectious agents is far more prevalent and should always be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with seafood-related illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29992029\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shellfish and pufferfish poisoning arise from consumption of seafood that is contaminated by various toxins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90120 \">table 1</a>). In most instances the ingested seafood smells, appears, and tastes normal. Clinical features of the most common forms of shellfish or pufferfish poisoning typically develop within minutes to hours of ingestion. A food history that identifies ingestion of seafood commonly associated with the specific toxin, clinical features consistent with the specific poisoning, and detection of elevated levels of the toxin in the ingested seafood provides the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive.
