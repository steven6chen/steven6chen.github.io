Patients with a preexcitation syndrome have an additional or alternative pathway, known as an accessory pathway, which directly connects the atria and ventricle and bypasses the AV node. AV conduction through an accessory pathway (most commonly a direct AV connection) results in the earlier activation of the ventricles than if the impulse had traveled through the AV node; hence the term preexcitation.</p><p>Accessory pathway is a generic term which may indicate either a &quot;tract&quot; which bypasses the AV node but inserts into the specialized conduction system (eg, the bundle of His, right or left bundles, or one of the fascicles), or a &quot;connection&quot; which bypasses the AV node and terminates directly within the myocardium. Other names that may be used include anomalous AV pathway, connection, or tract; accessory AV bypass pathway, connection, or tract; or simply AV bypass, tract, or pathway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-asynchronous-activation-and-preexcitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of asynchronous activation and preexcitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At other times, the specific sites of origin and termination are used. Examples include accessory atrioventricular connection, atrio-Hisian pathway or connection, or atriofascicular pathway or connection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53343\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53343 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Preexcitation through an AV bypass tract, the bundle of Kent, produces the electrocardiographic pattern described by Wolff, Parkinson, and White in 1930 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The terms preexcitation and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern are often used interchangeably. The electrocardiographic pattern of WPW should be differentiated from the &quot;WPW syndrome,&quot; since patients with the latter have both the electrocardiographic pattern of preexcitation and paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

AV accessory pathways exist only between the annulus fibrosus and the epicardial reflection off the atrial and ventricular walls, confined within the AV groove subepicardial fat of the right and left free walls, the anteroseptal space, and the posteroseptal space. Accessory pathways insert directly into the atrial and basal ventricular myocardium, although they may course through the AV groove at a variable depth from subepicardial to subendocardial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There are also vascular structures located in these regions. These include the circumflex coronary artery and coronary sinus in the left free wall space; the coronary sinus, middle cardiac vein, and posterior descending artery in the posteroseptal space; and the right coronary artery in the anteroseptal and right free wall spaces.</p><p>AV accessory pathways may run in an oblique course rather than perpendicular to the transverse plane of the AV groove. As a result, the fibers may have an atrial insertion point that is transversely several centimeters removed from the point of ventricular attachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Finally, bypass tracts may occasionally exist as broad bands of tissue rather than discrete hair-like structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5306931\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated structural cardiac abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accessory pathways are associated with structural heart abnormalities. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy appear to have a higher incidence of accessory pathways than the normal population.

Patients with Ebstein&rsquo;s anomaly can have right sided accessory pathways associated with the abnormal tricuspid valve and often have multiple accessory pathways. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is an association with a dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular preexcitation that can have a genetic basis. In addition, there are patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy felt to be caused by the ventricular dyssynchrony introduced by the ventricular preexcitation. This can resolve after ablation of the accessory pathway analogous to the improvements in ventricular function seen after cardiac resynchronization pacing therapy in patients with left bundle branch block and ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Posteroseptal accessory pathways may involve more than just the atrial and ventricular musculature, and include the musculature surrounding the coronary sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a study of 480 patients with posteroseptal or left posterior accessory pathways, 171 were found to involve the coronary sinus musculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The delta wave was negative in lead II in 70 percent of these patients. A coronary sinus diverticulum was found in 21 percent of these patients at this tertiary referral center, but in only 2 percent of the patients who had not had a prior ablation attempt. For this reason, it is important to perform venography of the proximal coronary sinus during an ablation procedure in a patient with a posteroseptal accessory pathway when elimination of the pathway proves to be difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY OF PREEXCITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal temporal and spatial sequence of atrial and ventricular activation is altered in the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) type of preexcitation because conduction between the atria and ventricles involves both an accessory pathway and the normal AV node-His Purkinje system.</p><p>The vast majority of accessory pathways generate a fast action potential due to the rapid inward sodium current, similar to normal His-Purkinje tissue and atrial and ventricular myocardium (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>). As a result, they have constant antegrade and retrograde conduction at all rates until the refractory period is reached, at which time conduction is completely blocked (nondecremental conduction).</p><p>In contrast, the AV node, which depends on the slow inward calcium current for generation and propagation of its action potential, exhibits decremental conduction in which the conduction time of the impulse propagating through the AV node increases as the cycle length shortens (heart rate increased) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thus, AV conduction is more rapid through the accessory pathway than through the AV node, a difference that is increased at fast heart rates.</p><p>This difference has potentially great clinical importance. The progressive prolongation of AV nodal conduction time at faster atrial rates has a protective role, limiting the ventricular response to rapid atrial rates in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. This decreasing speed of conduction until some but not all beats are transmitted through the AV nodal tissue is called decremental conduction. Accessory pathways are dependent on the rapid inward sodium current for depolarization and characteristically do not demonstrate decremental conduction. As a result, arrhythmias that utilize accessory pathways can conduct frequently and rapidly, leading to very fast ventricular rates during atrial fibrillation that may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mahaim fibers may have somewhat different properties in that they may show slow and decremental anterograde conduction, proximal AV nodal-like electrophysiologic properties and distal bundle branch-like properties, conduction block in response to adenosine, and heat-induced automaticity during radiofrequency catheter ablation. Spontaneous automaticity may arise in Mahaim fibers, particularly during ablation procedures of the atrial insertion, and this may trigger antidromic circus movement tachycardias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Accessory pathways that directly connect the atrium to the ventricle can occasionally show slow and decremental conduction in the retrograde direction. When these slowly conducting pathways serve as the retrograde limb during orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia, the RP interval is usually longer than the PR interval. These accessory pathways can lead to the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia and are usually located in the posteroseptal space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]<em>.</em> (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;, section on 'Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, accessory pathways that directly connect the atrium to the ventricle can also show decremental conduction in the antegrade direction. In these patients, preexcitation is not evident during sinus rhythm because conduction over the AV node is faster than over the accessory pathway, but the pathway can serve as the antegrade limb during antidromic AV reentrant tachycardia and give rise to a wide QRS tachycardia. These pathways are also usually in the posteroseptal location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since an AV accessory pathway usually bypasses and conducts faster than the AV node, the onset of ventricular activation is earlier than expected if depolarization occurred via the AV node. Since the accessory pathway usually exhibits nondecremental conduction, early activation remains constant at all heart rates.</p><p>Preexcited intraventricular conduction in WPW spreads from the insertion point of the AV bypass tract in the ventricular myocardium via direct muscle fiber-to-muscle fiber conduction. This process is inherently slower than ventricular depolarization resulting from rapid His-Purkinje system conduction. Thus, the net effect is earlier initial excitation of the ventricles (via the accessory pathway) but slower activation of the ventricular myocardium than occurs normally.</p><p>The net effect is that the QRS complex consists of fusion between early ventricular activation caused by preexcitation with the later ventricular activation resulting from transmission through the AV node and the infranodal conduction system to the ventricles. The initial part of ventricular activation is slowed and the upstroke of the QRS complex is slurred because of slow muscle fiber-to-muscle fiber conduction; this is termed a delta wave&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73740%7ECARD%2F53773\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73740 graphicRef53773 \">figure 4A-B</a>). The sooner conduction occurs over the accessory pathway in relation to the AV node, the greater the amount of myocardium depolarized via the accessory pathway, resulting in a more prominent or wider delta wave, and increasing prolongation of the QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62454 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimal preexcitation in WPW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preexcitation and delta waves may not be apparent in sinus rhythm in patients with WPW who have a left-lateral bypass tract as the antegrade route for conduction; in this setting, the time for the atrial impulse to reach the atrial insertion of the accessory pathway is longer than the time to reach the AV node. The presence of a septal Q wave in lead V6 of the surface electrocardiogram is useful to exclude minimal preexcitation with a high degree of reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. When there is uncertainty regarding the presence of ventricular preexcitation, vagal maneuvers can be performed or intravenous adenosine can be administered to cause transient AV nodal blockade.</p><p>The P wave signal-averaged ECG may also be of help in identifying a concealed left-sided accessory pathway. In one series, such a bypass tract was associated with a more prolonged filtered P wave duration (132 versus 119 milliseconds in controls or patients with an AV nodal reentrant tachycardia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=signal-averaged-electrocardiogram-overview-of-technical-aspects-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Signal-averaged electrocardiogram: Overview of technical aspects and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, delta waves are not seen with non-WPW forms of preexcitation, such as Mahaim or James fibers, since these pathways terminate in the conducting system or in the ventricular myocardium close to the conducting system. Most Mahaim tachycardias, for example, are due to atriofascicular pathways. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mahaim-fiber-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mahaim fiber tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">PR interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the impulse bypasses the AV node, the preexcited PR interval is often shorter than what would be considered normal; however, it may not be abnormally short in the absolute sense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The degree of PR interval shortening and the amount of QRS interval widening depend upon several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The balance between the antegrade conduction time and refractory period of the accessory pathway and those of the normal AV <span class=\"nowrap\">node/His-Purkinje</span> system; the conduction properties of both are variably influenced by the autonomic nervous system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The atrial insertion point of the AV bypass tract</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The site of atrial impulse origin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interatrial conduction time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial refractoriness</p><p/><p>Because of these factors, preexcitation may be less apparent during sinus tachycardia when AV node conduction time is short due to elevated sympathetic tone and decreased vagal tone. In addition, as mentioned above, an AV bypass tract that crosses the AV groove in the left lateral region may result in inapparent preexcitation and minimal PR interval shortening in sinus rhythm because of the greater interatrial distance required for impulse propagation from the sinus node to the left atrial insertion of the bypass tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent preexcitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent preexcitation should be distinguished from day-to-day variability in preexcitation which results from changes in AV nodal conduction in relation to those of the accessory pathway usually due to changes in autonomic tone. True intermittent preexcitation is characterized by abrupt loss of the delta wave, normalization of the QRS duration, and an increase in the PR interval during a continuous ECG recording in the absence of any significant change in heart rate. This finding is generally a reliable sign that the AV bypass tract has a relatively long antegrade refractory period and is not capable of frequent impulse conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Preexcitation alternans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In preexcitation alternans, a QRS complex manifesting a delta wave alternates with a normal QRS complex.

As a result, the appearance and width of the QRS complex depends upon the balance between preexcitation and normal excitation via the AV node. If AV nodal conduction is fast, the amount of myocardium activated via the accessory pathway is less, and hence there is a longer PR interval, less prominent delta wave, and narrower QRS complex. If AV nodal conduction is slow, more myocardium is activated via the accessory pathway, resulting in a shorter PR interval, more prominent delta wave, and wider QRS complex.</p><p>Changing degrees of AV nodal conduction and hence fusion in some patients may cause the QRS duration and the PR interval to periodically wax and wane, resulting in an appearance referred to as the &quot;concertina effect&quot; of preexcitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53508\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53508 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65293\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65293 \">waveform 2</a>). In this phenomenon, PR intervals and QRS complex durations show a cyclic pattern, eg, preexcitation becomes progressively more prominent over a number of QRS complex cycles followed by a gradual diminution in the degree of preexcitation over several QRS cycles despite a fairly constant heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Accessory pathways exhibiting decremental conduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of patients have accessory pathways in which conduction slows at faster rates of stimulation (decremental conduction), similar to the situation with the AV node. As noted above, the progressive prolongation of AV nodal conduction time at faster atrial rates has a protective role, limiting the ventricular response to rapid atrial rates in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.</p><p>Accessory pathways which display decremental conduction in one direction may exhibit varied electrophysiologic properties in the other. As an example, one study examined the characteristics of the accessory pathway in 74 patients with decremental accessory pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Among 64 patients with retrograde decremental conduction, anterograde conduction was not present in 64 percent, was intermittent in 8 percent, and was nondecremental in 28 percent. Five patients had anterograde but not retrograde conduction, and five had conduction in both directions. Another study examined 384 symptomatic patients with a single AP and found that retrograde decremental conduction over the AP was present in the posteroseptal (17 percent), and left free wall (3 percent), but absent in the other locations.

Bypass tracts that conduct only in an antegrade direction are uncommon. They often cross the right AV groove, and frequently possess decremental conduction properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/8,27,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27,31-33</a>].</p><p>Bypass tracts that conduct only in the retrograde direction occur more frequently with an incidence reported as high as 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Because they do not preexcite the ventricles, the surface ECG during sinus rhythm appears normal and therefore these pathways are called &quot;concealed&quot;. Some concealed pathways may be able to conduct anterograde, but have such long refractory periods that they do not conduct during sinus rhythm and are concealed. Preexcitation can sometimes be seen in patients with this type of a concealed accessory pathway after a long sinus pause, such as immediately after termination of AV reciprocating tachycardia. Most concealed AV bypass tracts exhibit nondecremental conduction and, because they serve as conduit for retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction, they are associated with reentrant arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Concealed accessory pathways that have decremental properties are usually located in the posteroseptal region. However, these pathways also occur in nonseptal locations with an incidence as high as 25 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

However, the electrocardiographic appearance of activation depends upon the extent of preexcitation and fusion; as a result, the same pathway may not always produce the identical ECG pattern. Furthermore, as many as 13 percent of individuals with preexcitation have more than one accessory pathway.

It also serves as a guide for the electrophysiologist to anticipate the morbidity of the particular procedural approach required to treat a particular accessory pathway (eg, ablation of pathways near the AV node and bundle of His has a higher inherent risk of inducing AV block and requiring a permanent pacemaker). This information related to pathway location is helpful when counseling patients about the risks of ablation.</p><p>The optimal time to use the surface ECG to estimate the location of the accessory pathway is in the electrophysiology laboratory during atrial pacing at a rate that results in maximal preexcitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Localizing the accessory AV connection site based upon the ECG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A useful approach to map the location of the common form of accessory pathway, the accessory AV connection (AAVC), combines the algorithms of Milstein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77941 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70648\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70648 \">algorithm 1</a>) and Arruda (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77941 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57692\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57692 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome/abstract/13,39,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,39,41,42</a>]. The Milstein approach accurately localizes the AAVC to general regions along the AV rings; the Arruda approach is more precise, as has been confirmed by endocardial mapping, and is helpful in further discriminating the septal areas of the AV rings. Distinctly classifying the <span class=\"nowrap\">posteroseptal/mid-septal/anteroseptal</span> areas also helps the clinician prepare the patient for different treatment options, including radiofrequency ablation, medical therapy, or monitoring.

This connection initiates a generally rightward activation of the right ventricle (RV) in one of the leftward leads (leading to negative delta waves in aVL <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> V6). The asynchronous activation of the right and then the left ventricle (LV) produces the LBBB-like ECG pattern. The QRS axis is greater than +30&ordm; which helps distinguish the right anteroseptal from a right lateral pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If yes and a LBBB-type configuration is not present, a left lateral pathway is suggested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74370\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74370 \">waveform 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50322\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef50322 \">waveform 5</a>). Preexcitation begins in the lateral portion of the left ventricle; as a result, initial activation is to the right as reflected by a negative delta wave in one or more of the leftward leads (ECG 2 shows isoelectric to negative polarity in I and aVL while ECG 3 shows a negative delta wave in aVL). The pattern may then resemble an atypical RBBB, because preexcitation begins in the left ventricle.</p><p/><p>If the delta waves in leads I, aVL and V6 are other than a Q wave or isoelectric, examine the vector first in the frontal plane and then in the horizontal plane. Specifically, see if the delta wave vector in the frontal plane forms a Q wave or is isoelectric in two of leads II, III, or aVF.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If yes, examine the horizontal plane. If there is an Rs or RS in V1, V2, or V3, a posteroseptal pathway is suggested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69988%7ECARD%2F57211%7ECARD%2F59055%7ECARD%2F71868\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69988 graphicRef57211 graphicRef59055 graphicRef71868 \">waveform 6A-D</a>).

Preexcitation begins in the lateral portion of the right ventricle, which is anatomically anterior and to the right; as a result, activation is posteriorly and to the left. A LBBB-type pattern results because the RV is activated before the LV.
