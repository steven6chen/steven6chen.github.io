(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ingestion of NSAIDs can give rise to several allergic and &quot;pseudoallergic&quot; reactions, which develop within minutes to hours of administration. Allergic reactions are abnormal immunologic reactions to NSAIDs, while pseudoallergic reactions are nonimmunologic reactions that are believed to result from acquired alterations in the biochemical pathways upon which NSAIDs act.</p><p>The prevalence of allergic and pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs in the general population is not known. These reactions occur sporadically in both children and adults. Symptoms include rhinoconjunctivitis, bronchospasm, <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema,</span> and anaphylaxis.</p><p>In addition to allergic reactions, there are various types of idiosyncratic adverse reactions to NSAIDs that are presumed or known to involve other types of immune mechanisms. These include, but are not limited to, aseptic meningitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, interstitial nephritis, erythema multiforme, fixed drug eruptions, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema nodosum, maculopapular eruptions, and bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These types of reactions are discussed in various topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eruptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug eruptions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of allergic and pseudoallergic reactions caused by NSAIDs will be reviewed here. The challenge protocols used by allergy specialists to evaluate and manage affected patients are presented separately.

There are two known COX isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-1 is expressed constitutively in all human cell types and is involved in protective physiologic functions, such as gastric mucosal protection. Inhibition of COX-1 impairs these protective functions and is generally undesirable. As an example, COX-1 inhibition by NSAIDs results in diminished production of the protective compound prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> in the gastric mucosa, leading to gastritis in susceptible patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-2 is an inducible enzyme expressed in many inflammatory cells in the presence of appropriate stimuli. COX-2 mediates the generation of the same range of prostaglandins as COX-1, but only at sites of inflammation. Thus, COX-2 inhibition is largely responsible for the desired anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs.</p><p/><p>The various NSAIDs inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 to different degrees. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> (ASA) is a strong inhibitor of COX-1. In this topic, NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 are said to be &quot;cross-reactive&quot; with ASA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62880 \">table 1</a>). NSAIDs that inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 are called nonselective, while those that predominantly inhibit COX-2 are called COX-2 selective. Within the group of selective NSAIDs are those that are weakly selective for COX-2 but also inhibit COX-1, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabumetone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabumetone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meloxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meloxicam</a>, and nimesulide (not available in the United States). Other agents are considered highly selective for COX-2, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>.</p><p>The mechanism of action of NSAIDs and the different types of agents available are reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAID reactions can be categorized as either pseudoallergic or allergic. Pseudoallergic reactions are induced by multiple different NSAIDs, while allergic reactions are usually induced by a single NSAID or a small number of structurally similar agents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pseudoallergic NSAID reactions</strong> &ndash; Pseudoallergic reactions are nonimmunologic reactions that are related to the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)-inhibiting properties of the drug. In susceptible individuals, these reactions may be elicited by any NSAID that inhibits COX-1, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (ASA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62880 \">table 1</a>). Affected patients are believed to have acquired alterations in the biochemical pathways affected by COX-1-inhibitors, although the precise mechanism underlying pseudoallergic reactions has not been established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic NSAID reactions</strong> &ndash; Allergic NSAID reactions are presumed to be immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immunologic reactions based upon their clinical characteristics. These are elicited by a single NSAID in a susceptible individual.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PSEUDOALLERGIC REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudoallergic reactions are elicited by any cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)-inhibiting NSAID, and the likelihood that an NSAID will cause these in a susceptible patient is related to the strength with which that drug inhibits COX-1. Pseudoallergic reactions are usually seen in patients with one of the following comorbidities: the combination of asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis or chronic urticaria.</p><p>Pseudoallergic reactions can be divided into four types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 &ndash; NSAID-induced asthma and rhinosinusitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 &ndash; NSAID-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span> in patients with chronic urticaria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3 &ndash; NSAID-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span> in otherwise asymptomatic individuals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 4 &ndash; Blended (mixed respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cutaneous) reactions in otherwise asymptomatic individuals</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1: NSAID-induced asthma and rhinosinusitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAID ingestion precipitates a constellation of naso-ocular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower respiratory symptoms in some patients with concomitant asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (often with nasal polyposis). These include one or more of the following: rhinorrhea; nasal congestion; periorbital edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> injection of the conjunctiva; bronchospasm; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laryngospasm. Some patients can experience hives <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema in addition to the respiratory tract symptoms. A few patients with severe respiratory reactions have accompanying extra respiratory tract symptoms, such as flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hypotension. These reactions are termed type 1 pseudoallergic reactions. Type 1 reactions typically begin one to three hours after administration.</p><p>Patients with the combination of NSAID pseudoallergy, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis are said to have aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Another term for this disorder is NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD). AERD and the diagnosis of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> pseudoallergy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: NSAID challenge and desensitization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2: NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema in patients with chronic urticaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a history of chronic urticaria can develop an exacerbation of their hives, sometimes with angioedema, beginning 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion of ASA or NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The exacerbating effects of NSAIDs may be noticeable in up to 30 percent of patients with stable chronic urticaria, and higher rates of NSAID sensitivity are typical in patients with active urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These reactions are usually dose-dependent.</p><p>Avoidance of COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs can be helpful in minimizing acute flares in chronic urticaria, although it does not appear to alter the long-term course of the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Pharmacotherapy of patients with chronic urticaria is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Standard management and patient education&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 3: NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema in otherwise asymptomatic individuals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this form of pseudoallergy, children and adults <strong>without</strong> underlying chronic urticaria develop acute urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion of COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs. Isolated angioedema following NSAID ingestion typically involves the facial areas, particularly the periorbital skin, lips, and mouth. These patients may develop urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema only after NSAID ingestion or may have intermittent episodes of unexplained urticaria unrelated to NSAID ingestion, but they do not have underlying chronic urticaria (ie, recurrent episodes of <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span> persisting for six weeks or longer). It is not known whether these patients subsequently develop chronic urticaria more frequently than the general population.</p><p>The probable mechanism is related to COX-1 inhibition, as patients with type 3 pseudoallergy can react to their very first dose of a COX-1 inhibitor and to structurally different COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs. In addition, such patients usually tolerate highly selective COX-2-inhibiting NSAIDs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 4: Blended reactions in otherwise asymptomatic individuals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, reactions to <span class=\"nowrap\">NSAIDs/ASA</span> do not fit into the above three reaction types. Some patients with underlying AERD develop cutaneous symptoms as well as respiratory symptoms in response to NSAIDs and are included in this group. Patients without apparent underlying conditions may develop combinations of symptoms affecting both the respiratory tract and skin, including bronchospasm, rhinitis, urticaria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema after ingestion of different COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs. These reactions are usually triggered by multiple COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs and may represent a combination of mechanisms. Until they are better characterized, these reactions have been classified as a separate type.</p><p>The time course of type 4 reactions is variable. The author has observed the following patterns: reactions that are purely cutaneous usually appear within 30 minutes, while patients with AERD with cutaneous symptoms as part of respiratory reactions show a delay identical to patients with type 1 reactions (with an average delay after administration of about 90 minutes). Patients with both cutaneous and respiratory reactions, but without underlying AERD, typically react at about 60 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLERGIC REACTIONS (PRESUMED IgE-MEDIATED)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic reactions to NSAIDs range from <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span> to life-threatening anaphylaxis. In contrast to pseudoallergic reactions, these reactions are elicited by a single NSAID or rarely by more than one agent with similar molecular structures. Patients with allergic reactions to an NSAID have had at least one prior exposure to the culprit drug, which presumedly sensitizes them and results in symptoms upon repeat exposure to the same drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>These reactions are believed to be immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, and the allergen is thought to be a drug metabolite bound to a carrier protein. In the United States, most of these reactions have been associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, the first NSAID to become available over-the-counter, although they can happen with any NSAID. There has been one case report of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (ASA)-induced angioedema with measurable-specific IgE to <span class=\"nowrap\">aspirin/human</span> serum albumin complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the generalizability of this finding is unknown, and there are no practical or commercially available tests to detect IgE to NSAIDs (such as skin testing or drug-specific serum IgE tests).</p><p>Allergic reactions may be divided into two types, based solely upon the severity of the symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 2</a>). The underlying mechanism is believed to be the same. It is possible that most patients with type 5 reactions would progress to anaphylaxis (type 6) if they took the same NSAID repeatedly. Thus, some experts consider types 5 and 6 to be different severities of the same type of reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 5: Urticaria/angioedema to a single NSAID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with type 5 reactions typically develop urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema within minutes to one hour of taking a particular NSAID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Affected individuals generally do not have underlying chronic urticaria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 6: Anaphylaxis to a single NSAID (not ASA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 6 reactions are distinguished from type 5 reactions based only upon severity. Patients with anaphylaxis have usually experienced urticarial reactions to the culprit NSAID in the past, but did not realize the association and continued to re-expose themselves to the drug. Typical symptoms of anaphylaxis include shortness of <span class=\"nowrap\">breath/wheezing</span> due to bronchospasm or laryngeal edema and hypotension due to vascular collapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anaphylaxis has been reported with various NSAIDs, including most of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)-inhibiting agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>], as well as from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> (a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibuprofen</a> is the NSAID most commonly implicated in severe anaphylaxis in the United States, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> is more common in France, and the pyrazole NSAIDs (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, azapropazone) are commonly implicated in Spain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/10,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20</a>]. It is notable that there are no confirmed cases of anaphylaxis to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> itself. This is one reason that aspirin is used in challenge procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1362385\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic strategy'</a> below.)</p><p>There are also reports of anaphylaxis due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (paracetamol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This agent is an antipyretic and pain reliever, rather than an anti-inflammatory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAID reactions range from mild to life-threatening and are challenging to diagnose because some of the signs and symptoms of minor and severe reactions are similar. The presumptive diagnosis of an allergic or pseudoallergic reaction to an NSAID is based upon the historical details of the reaction. In some situations, an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge procedure can be performed to assess specificity. However, challenges should be done by clinicians trained in performing them. There are no validated in vitro or skin testing methods available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain critical pieces of information should be obtained from the history, if possible:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the reaction elicited by one NSAID or multiple NSAIDs? It is important to discern if the patient took any other cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)-inhibiting NSAIDs <strong>subsequent to</strong> the first recognized reaction. If so, did this drug also cause a reaction? If other NSAIDs also caused symptoms, then the patient has pseudoallergic reaction. In contrast, NSAIDs that were ingested without problems <strong>before</strong> the first reaction are not relevant, because reactions to NSAIDs are nearly always acquired (rather than present from birth).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there underlying <span class=\"nowrap\">asthma/rhinosinusitis/nasal</span> polyposis (ie, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [AERD]) or chronic idiopathic urticaria? Any recurrent symptoms of asthma or sinus problems or previous episodes of urticaria should be explored to discern if one of these conditions may be present but undiagnosed. These chronic conditions usually develop before the NSAID reaction, with rare exceptions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262516220\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For types 1 to 4 NSAID reactions, there are no validated in vitro or skin testing methods available. However, there may be exceptions for some type 5 and 6 reactions. As an example, in a series of six cases of severe anaphylaxis to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, intradermal skin testing was positive in four patients, at concentrations ranging from 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this series, a parenteral preparation of diclofenac was available for skin testing, though testing results with control patients was not reported. Intravenous preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> are available as well, and skin testing can be performed with concentrations ranging from 0.001 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> to 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> is available but extremely expensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Challenge procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a definitive diagnosis is required, then a challenge procedure must be performed. In most situations, this is only indicated if the patient has a medical need for future NSAID therapy. If so, a challenge procedure can determine if the patient tolerates NSAIDs <strong>other than the one that caused the reaction</strong> or could be desensitized to NSAIDs. Challenges with the culprit drug are only rarely done to confirm a type 5 or 6 reaction to a specific NSAID, since this can elicit severe anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1362385\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is sometimes difficult to determine what type of reaction has occurred if a patient has had only one event and has avoided all NSAIDs since. As an example, if a patient with asthma developed flushing and bronchospasm after taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, then the reaction may have been type 1, type 4, or type 5. Without additional information, the clinician must initially advise the patient to avoid all NSAIDs.</p><p>A diagnostic strategy used successfully at the author's center for decades is to challenge patients with past reactions to NSAIDs using an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge protocol. Aspirin is a potent COX-1 inhibitor, and it has not been implicated in type 5 or 6 reactions. Thus, if the patient reacts to aspirin, the patient has a pseudoallergic reaction. If there is no reaction to aspirin, the patient likely has an isolated type 5 or 6 reaction to the NSAID that caused the past reaction.</p><p>The protocols used for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge and desensitization are reviewed separately.

Highly selective COX-2 inhibitors are tolerated by most patients with pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs, with the exceptions discussed below. This option is appropriate for patients who need an anti-inflammatory agent, have had gastrointestinal toxicity with NSAIDs, or are not seeking to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for its cardioprotective effects.

This meta-analysis included 426 adults with AERD and challenge-proven reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other NSAIDs, who underwent blinded challenges with standard doses of COX-2 inhibitors. No reactions were observed. However, the authors noted that moderate doses of COX-2 inhibitors were used in all studies, so these data do not exclude the possibility that some very sensitive patients might still react to very high doses of these agents. Until that is known, it is prudent to recommend that patients begin with a low dose of COX-2 inhibitor and increase the dose gradually, as tolerated, if high-dose therapy is needed. However, as AERD patients can generate normal amounts of this inducible enzyme, it is the author's approach simply to tell patients with AERD that it is safe to take COX-2 inhibitors and to recommend a specific initial dose. However, if the patient is anxious about this or the clinician is not confident about some aspect of the patient's history, it is advisable to be cautious and either refer the patient to a drug allergy expert or to administer the first dose in a supervised setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with type 3 pseudoallergy <span class=\"nowrap\">(urticaria/angioedema</span> in otherwise asymptomatic individuals) usually tolerate highly selective COX-2 inhibitors, although one study did not find this. In this report of 252 subjects with type 3 pseudoallergy, 25 percent developed symptoms after taking a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, etoricoxib. The reactions were quite mild and resolved rapidly after administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>.

Based on this one report, some clinicians may prefer to give an initial dose of COX-2 inhibitor to highly sensitive patients with type 3 pseudoallergy in a medically supervised setting (eg, a clinic), at least until these data have been reproduced. Additional case reports of possible reactions to COX-2 inhibitors exist, although these are likely flawed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with types 2 and 4 pseudoallergy, all except rare individuals will tolerate highly selective COX-2 inhibitors.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization is a technique in which the patient is given incrementally increasing doses of a medication under medical supervision to induce a state of temporary tolerance. After a patient has been successfully desensitized to an NSAID, that agent or another equivalent NSAID <strong>must be ingested daily in order to maintain tolerance</strong>. Therefore, desensitization is appropriate in patients who require daily NSAIDs for an inflammatory disorder or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for antiplatelet therapy.</p><p>NSAID desensitizations are usually performed by allergy specialists. Some pulmonary specialists are also experienced in this procedure. The supervising specialist should have experience in recognizing and treating the symptoms that may arise during these procedures. Desensitizations are performed in medical settings with appropriate medications, equipment, and support staff. NSAID desensitizations are discussed separately.

Once they have been successfully desensitized to ASA, they are able to ingest other NSAIDs safely and can take different NSAIDs interchangeably. Desensitization enables AERD patients with cardiovascular disease to take prophylactic daily ASA or those with rheumatologic conditions to take daily NSAIDs. Furthermore, daily ASA therapy ameliorates the inflammation underlying sinus and pulmonary disease in AERD and can be used to treat both asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. ASA desensitization and the management of AERD are reviewed separately.

Although they can sometimes be successfully desensitized at first, almost all patients have recurrent reactions over time, presumably because the ongoing presence of NSAIDs aggravates the underlying chronic urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions/abstract/5,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite this, patients with type 2 reactions who need <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for cardioprotection can sometimes tolerate 81 mg (or 100 mg) dose of aspirin daily without significant worsening of their symptoms.

There are no in vitro tests, and skin testing methods are only reported for very few NSAIDs.
