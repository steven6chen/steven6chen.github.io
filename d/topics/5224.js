Accurate identification of women truly in preterm labor allows appropriate application of interventions that can improve neonatal outcome: antenatal corticosteroid therapy, group B streptococcal infection prophylaxis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> for neuroprotection, and transfer to a facility with an appropriate level nursery (if necessary). On the other hand, accurate triage of women not actually in preterm labor can avoid performance of unnecessary interventions and associated costs for the approximately 50 percent of patients with suspected preterm labor who will go on to deliver at term without tocolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-preterm-labor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will describe our approach to the diagnostic evaluation of women who present with possible preterm labor and provide an overview of issues related to preterm birth.

The following are early signs and symptoms of labor; however, they are non-specific and can be present for several hours in women who do not exhibit cervical change:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual-like cramping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild, irregular contractions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low back ache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure sensation in the vagina or pelvis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal discharge of mucus, which may be clear, pink, or slightly bloody (ie, mucus plug, bloody show)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spotting, light bleeding</p><p/><p>Uterine contractions are the sine qua non of labor, but mild irregular contractions are a normal finding at all stages of pregnancy, thereby adding to the challenge of distinguishing true labor (contractions that result in cervical change) from false labor (contractions that do not result in cervical change, ie, Braxton Hicks contractions). True labor is more likely when an increasing frequency of contractions is accompanied by increasing intensity and duration of contractions as an increase in the frequency of contractions alone may occur transiently, especially at night and with increasing gestational age. Although many investigators have tried, no one has been able to identify a threshold contraction frequency that effectively identifies women who will progress to true labor. Only 13 percent of women presenting at &lt;34 weeks of gestation with explicit contraction criteria for preterm labor deliver within one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-preterm-labor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Cervical changes on physical examination that precede or accompany true labor include dilation, effacement, softening, and movement to a more anterior position. A short or a dilated cervix may be the first clinical manifestation of a parturition process triggered by subclinical inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-preterm-labor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The swab is rotated in the posterior fornix for 10 seconds. In both methods, it is important to stop at the first sign of resistance to avoid rupturing exposed membranes, if present.

A digital examination should be performed sooner if the information is urgently needed to care for the patient (eg, abnormal fetal heart rate, probable advanced phase of active labor) and placenta previa is unlikely. As discussed above, cervical dilation &gt;3 cm in the presence of uterine contractions at 20 to 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</sup></span> weeks supports the diagnosis of preterm labor and inhibition of acute preterm labor is less likely to be successful as the cervix dilates beyond 3 cm.</p><p>When assessing cervical dilation and effacement in the second trimester, it is important to distinguish between patients whose membranes have hour-glassed (prolapsed) through a mildly dilated and effaced cervix (suggestive of cervical insufficiency) and those who are in active labor with advanced cervical dilation and effacement. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) assessment of the cervical length in the second trimester can be used to make the diagnosis of cervical insufficiency in women with risk factors. Only a digital cervical examination is needed in patients with advanced cervical dilation.

A short cervix before 34 weeks of gestation is predictive of preterm birth in all populations, while a long cervix has a high negative predictive value for preterm birth. Knowledge of cervical length in women with threatened preterm labor may improve outcome, but information is limited. A meta-analysis of individual patient data reported that clinician knowledge of cervical length in women with threatened preterm labor reduced the rate of preterm birth compared with absence of this information (22 versus 35 percent; RR 0.64. 95% CI 0.44-0.94; three trials; n = 287 participants), but other outcomes were not significantly different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-preterm-labor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Disruption of this interface due to subclinical infection or inflammation, abruption or uterine contractions releases fFN into cervicovaginal secretions, which is the basis for its use as a marker for predicting spontaneous preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-preterm-labor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Measurement of fFN is performed to distinguish women in true preterm labor from those with false labor. Theoretically, accurate identification of women in true preterm labor provides an opportunity for interventions that can improve neonatal outcome (eg, antenatal corticosteroid therapy, group B streptococcal infection prophylaxis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> for neuroprotection, transfer to a facility with an appropriate level nursery, if necessary). It should also avoid unnecessary intervention and associated costs for the 20 to 50 percent who will go on to deliver at term without tocolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-preterm-labor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, fFN results alone are not useful. In a 2016 systematic review of six randomized clinical trials in which a total of 546 women with threatened preterm labor were randomly assigned to management with reported or concealed fetal fibronectin results, clinician knowledge of fFN results did not significantly reduce rates of maternal hospitalization, use of tocolytics, use of antenatal corticosteroids, or preterm birth, but increased hospitalization costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-preterm-labor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>The review excluded studies in which management involved use of both fFN and sonographic cervical length, which is our approach. We obtain fFN selectively, limiting its use to women with cervical length 20 to 30 mm.
