Most studies that have examined the efficacy of TTO have used the subject as his or her own control. In the short-term physiologic studies, patients with an existing transtracheocutaneous fistula usually received interventions related to tracheal gas delivery in a random order, and then were compared to controls with no tracheal flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In the long-term clinical studies, data collected after initiation of TTO therapy were compared to data collected while the patient was receiving LTOT by nasal cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].

Specifically, transtracheal gas delivery reduces inspired minute volume, dead space volume, and tidal volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/2,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10-12</a>]. It also shortens the time of inspiration and decreases the work of breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Higher tracheal flows produce greater benefit than lower flows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Anecdotal benefits have also been attributed to TTO therapy. These include reduced dyspnea, greater comfort, elimination of nasal cannula complications, improved self image, and possibly decreased readmission rates for COPD exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>TTO therapy increases the number of hours per day that supplemental oxygen is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]. Increased compliance with oxygen therapy has been shown to improve survival; however, the effect of TTO on survival has not been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transtracheal oxygen (TTO) therapy is most appropriate for patients with chronic hypoxemia who require a low oxygen flow rate and are in an early stage of their illness, because such individuals are most likely to experience improved quality of life for many years. Benefit is less likely and complications are more common when TTO therapy is initiated in patients who require high flow rates during a preterminal phase of their illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58434 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].

However, the risks versus the benefits of TTO therapy in this situation should be carefully weighed and discussed with the patient because such patients are more likely to experience a complication.</p><p>Despite broad support from patients with TTO, the frequency of TTO remains low in the total population of patients requiring LTOT. There are several reasons for this low frequency, and among them are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of familiarity with TTO within the pulmonary community</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perceptions, or misperceptions, about the complexity and risks of the procedure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Financial barriers to reimbursement for catheter replacement cost, which is bundled into the payment to suppliers for durable medical equipment (DME) under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) capped rental and competitive bidding program</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited studies in a small patient population where data are insufficient to meet evidence-based requirements</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTO therapy should not be offered to patients who are in acute respiratory distress, medically unstable, or have unsuitable anatomy, such as a severe upper airway obstruction or pleura herniated into the site selected for creation of the tracheocutaneous fistula. It also should not be initiated in patients who cannot consistently perform their own catheter care, are noncompliant with medical care, or have a severe anxiety disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73278 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Some patient characteristics do not preclude TTO therapy, but may predispose an individual to complications and should be carefully considered when determining whether a patient is appropriate for TTO therapy. They include poor pulmonary reserve, obese neck or other anatomical challenges, moderate to severe anxiety, bronchial hyperreactivity, copious or unusually viscous sputum, bleeding disorder, or poor healing. Management of medications that increase bleeding risk would be that same as for any other interventional procedure or surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transtracheal oxygen (TTO) therapy is usually coordinated by a team that consists of a clinician and a respiratory care practitioner (respiratory therapist) or nurse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Close communication among the clinicians, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners comprising the TTO team is central to the success of a TTO program. Hence, transtracheal oxygen should be viewed as a &ldquo;program of care,&rdquo; and not just a medical device.</p><p>Centers with more experience report fewer technical problems, which suggests that there is a learning curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/8,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21</a>]. Thus, it is advisable that institutions introduce TTO in a graduated fashion, starting with ideal candidates and progressing to more difficult patients once there is more substantial institutional experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Once it has been determined that TTO therapy is appropriate, it is usually initiated using the Spofford Christopher Oxygen Optimizing Program (SCOOP), which consists of four distinct phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/1,13,15,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,15,22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phase I involves preparation for creation of a tracheocutaneous fistula, in which the transtracheal catheter will reside (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63083 \">table 5</a>). This consists of a preprocedure evaluation and patient education.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Preprocedure evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should undergo a preprocedure evaluation that is aimed at optimizing baseline pulmonary status and identifying and excluding poor candidates for tracheocutaneous fistula creation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58434 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73278 \">table 4</a>). The procedure should be delayed if the patient is unstable or his or her condition could be better optimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The evaluation includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A directed history and physical examination should be performed to identify any new or increased symptoms (eg, increased sputum) or signs (eg, wheezing) that indicate that the patient's medical condition is not optimized. Neck anatomy is assessed to make sure tracheal interspaces are easily identifiable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76129 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest radiograph is necessary to exclude patients with anatomic contraindications or challenges to the procedure, such as pleura herniated into the site selected for creation of the tracheocutaneous fistula or a deviated trachea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spirometry with measurement of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) pre- and post-bronchodilator should be performed to evaluate ventilatory reserve and assess risk for bronchospasm. We typically perform spirometry within one week of the procedure; we delay the procedure and intensify the medical regimen if FEV<sub>1</sub> is less than 500 mL or is less than 70 percent of that patient's baseline (if baseline data are available) or increases more than 12 percent following inhaled bronchodilator. Patients prone to bronchospasm should be monitored more closely through all steps, especially during initial catheter changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial blood gases should be reviewed to determine the severity of the hypoxemia (ie, the arterial oxygen tension, PaO<sub>2</sub>) and the ventilatory impairment (ie, the pH and arterial carbon dioxide tension, PaCO<sub>2</sub>). These values are useful in confirming the need for supplemental oxygen therapy, assessing clinical stability, and determining the likelihood that a patient will benefit from TTO. The severity of ventilatory impairment (reduced FEV<sub>1</sub> or hypercarbia) that precludes TTO is determined on a case-by-case basis after carefully weighing the importance of the potential benefits, the experience of the care team, and the risks of the procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73278 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comprehensive teaching is important because patients must be able to reliably care for the catheter and recognize potential complications. Ideally, patients should view a training video, receive an educational booklet, participate in a question and answer session with a staff member, and speak to a patient who is using transtracheal oxygen&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13,15,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phase II involves creation of the tracheocutaneous fistula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74858\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74858 \">table 6</a>).

The one week delay reduces the risk of subcutaneous emphysema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipkin procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Lipkin procedure (ie, mini-tracheotomy) is a surgical approach to tracheocutaneous fistula creation that avoids some of the shortcomings of the MST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. It is generally done under moderate sedation (conscious sedation), but can be performed under general anesthesia administered via a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in the operating room. The procedure requires less than one hour and the patient remains in the hospital under observation until the next day. A general outline of the procedure is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascertain adequate conscious sedation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carefully identify the first or second tracheal interspace (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76129 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare the site with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> and drape the area with sterile towels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reidentify the correct tracheal interspace (usually the first or second tracheal interspace) and make a vertical incision at the selected site. Flaps of full-thickness skin are elevated, and cervical fat is removed down to the strap muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate the strap muscles at the midline, exposing the anterior wall of the trachea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suture the skin flaps to the undersides of the exposed sternothyroid muscles, thereby forming an epithelialized tract that extends to the anterior wall of the trachea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make a small horizontal incision between the tracheal cartilage rings, and puncture the trachea at this incision using a device called a tracheal punch.

If a narcotic is not needed for analgesia, cough can usually be managed with a nonnarcotic cough suppressant or by injecting 1 to 5 mL of 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) into the stent every four to six hours.</p><p>The following day, a guidewire is threaded through the stent, the stent is removed, the transtracheal catheter is inserted, and the guidewire is removed leaving only the catheter in position. The catheter is held in position by a bead chain necklace. Placement of clear medical tape over the necklace, just lateral to the catheter on each side, further secures the catheter in position. At this time, the patient can begin to receive TTO therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparison</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tracheocutaneous fistula creation using the MST has several shortcomings. The catheter cannot be removed by the patient and thoroughly cleaned until the tract is mature and the patient has been trained to periodically remove and reinsert it. This usually takes about eight weeks. During this time, there is a tendency for mucus to adhere to the tip of the catheter and accumulate (ie, form a mucus ball), which can cause upper airway obstruction and respiratory deterioration. The care team must periodically remove the catheter over a guidewire to clean it. In addition, the tracheocutaneous fistula can close (ie, lost tract) if the catheter is dislodged. Chondritis and chronic tract inflammation can develop in tracheal cartilage inadvertently exposed or injured during the procedure, which may also stimulate keloid formation in predisposed individuals. All of these adverse sequelae can compromise the tracheocutaneous fistula, making catheter insertion difficult.</p><p>Observational studies suggest that the Lipkin procedure is well tolerated and has a number of benefits compared to the MST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25</a>]. In a review of 33 Lipkin procedures compared with 64 historical controls who underwent MST, the following observations were made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tracheocutaneous fistula created by the Lipkin procedure matured faster than that created by the MST (two versus eight weeks).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucus ball formation is lower with the Lipkin procedure (5 to 10 percent) compared with the MST (10 to 15 percent). The rate of tract loss is also lower with the Lipkin procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of a window of cartilage reduced the incidence of chondritis (12 versus 25 percent) and keloid formation, which may further reduce the risk of lost tracts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgically created tract had fewer instances of subcutaneous emphysema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the Lipkin procedure TTO therapy was initiated one day after the procedure, rather than one week.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase III</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phase III involves the initiation of TTO through an immature tracheocutaneous fistula (ie, tract) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57966 \">table 7</a>). The main goals of this phase are to prevent symptomatic mucus balls, prevent tract loss, and monitor tract healing. This phase applies equally to tracts created by either the modified Seldinger technique or the Lipkin procedure.</p><p>Once the nonfunctioning stent has been replaced with a transtracheal catheter and secured with a fitted bead chain necklace, TTO therapy can begin. Oxygen flow is titrated to achieve an adequate oxyhemoglobin saturation during rest and exertion, as measured by pulse oximetry. Patients, family members, and caregivers are instructed about catheter care, which includes cleaning the internal lumen of the catheter with instilled saline and a cleaning rod at least twice daily. Patients should return two to three times over the next two weeks to reinforce education, evaluate tract maturity, and strip mucus from the outside of the catheter.</p><p>Normal sequelae encountered during the first few days include mild tenderness at the insertion site, scant hemoptysis, or a transient increase in cough and sputum production. Patients may have an air leak through the stoma for a few days, which can affect speech. Gentle pressure on the stoma makes phonation easier if this occurs.</p><p>The convention has been to administer TTO with a continuous flow of oxygen. Pulse or demand oxygen delivery systems (DODS) that require one lumen for delivery and a separate lumen for sensing inspiratory effort are not compatible with the single lumen TTO catheter. As a result, specific DODS designs utilizing alternating sensing and delivery through a single lumen have been assessed in terms of adequacy of oxyhemoglobin saturation and oxygen savings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, it does not appear that DODS adds substantially to oxygen conservation achieved with TTO alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portable-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-conserving-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portable oxygen delivery and oxygen conserving devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Tract loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dislodgement of the transtracheal catheter can result in tract loss. To minimize the likelihood of tract loss, patients should be instructed about what to do if inadvertent dislodgement of the transtracheal catheter occurs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Return to nasal cannula oxygen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean the catheter and lubricate it with sterile, water soluble jelly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gently attempt reinsertion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assistance should be sought from the TTO team if reinsertion is not successful after two attempts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the team is also unsuccessful, it may be possible to insert a guide wire and then the catheter</p><p/><p>Multiple reinsertion attempts are not advised, because this can create a false tract, with misplacement of the catheter pre- or paratracheally into the anterior mediastinum. Repeat tract creation can be considered if the tract cannot be recovered. The Lipkin procedure has a much lower rate of tract loss, compared to the MST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Mucus accumulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucus can accumulate around the distal tip of the catheter and form a mucus ball, which may be large enough to cause upper airway obstruction and respiratory deterioration. To prevent this, patients should be instructed about minimizing mucus accumulation and recognizing mucus accumulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measures to minimize mucus accumulation include adequate humidification of supplemental oxygen, frequent cleaning of the transtracheal catheter, adequate systemic hydration, and administration of a mucokinetic agent. We typically prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guaifenesin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guaifenesin</a> 600 to 1200 mg orally twice a day. In addition, for patients with COPD who are not on inhaled glucocorticoid therapy, we often add an inhaled glucocorticoid to decrease mucus production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early recognition of mucus accumulation is facilitated by frequent monitoring by telephone, frequent follow-up visits, and patient education about symptoms that suggest mucus ball accumulation (eg, increased or severe cough, dyspnea, or wheezing).</p><p/><p>Patients with a low FEV<sub>1</sub> and weak cough may require more frequent catheter stripping because they are less likely to be able to expel accumulating mucus. Similarly, individuals requiring high TTO flows and those with copious or tenacious sputum are predisposed to mucus balls. Catheter stripping refers to removal of the catheter from the tract over a guidewire by the team, during which most of the mucus that has accumulated around the distal tip of the catheter will be scraped off by the removal process, and subsequently expelled by cough. Mucus that remains on the catheter can be manually removed during cleaning and then the catheter must be promptly reinserted over the guidewire.</p><p>Mucus ball accumulation is most common in Phase III, but can occur after years of uneventful TTO therapy. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients experience symptomatic mucus balls when the MST procedure is used, compared with 5 to 10 percent with the Lipkin procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase IV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phase IV involves the maintenance of TTO therapy through a mature tract, which is defined as a tract through which the catheter easily slips into position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65577\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65577 \">table 8</a>). The goal of this phase is for the patient to avoid complications through self care.</p><p>During Phase IV, a cleaning protocol should be customized to patient needs. Cleaning protocols can utilize cleaning the catheter while it is in position (as in Phase III) and cleaning the catheter once it has been removed. The removed catheter is replaced by a previously cleaned second catheter in an alternating fashion. The protocol can be adjusted according to symptoms. The majority of patients remove the catheter for cleaning twice per day to prevent mucus accumulation. Others do well with cleaning in place twice daily on most days, with removal for cleaning once or twice per week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most complications are not life-threatening. These include subcutaneous emphysema, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, mucus collection, lost tracts, chondritis, and infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/1,4,5,8,21,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,8,21,28,29</a>]. One small case series described frequent lower respiratory tract infections that required hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. All of the patients in this report had severe interstitial lung disease and required a high oxygen flow rate.</p><p>Life-threatening complications have been described in case reports. These complications include airway obstruction from a massive mucus ball, extratracheal misplacement of the catheter, and pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transtracheal-oxygen-therapy/abstract/31-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transtracheal oxygen (TTO) therapy refers to the delivery of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) through a transtracheal catheter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77845\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77845 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTO therapy offers several potential benefits, compared to LTOT delivered by nasal cannula, including reduced dyspnea, improved mobility, improved comfort, increased exercise capacity, and fewer days of hospitalization. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic hypoxemia who require a low oxygen flow rate and are in an early stage of their illness are the most likely to experience improved quality of life when using TTO therapy, compared to LTOT via nasal cannula. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reasons to choose TTO, instead of nasal cannula, include patient preference, reduced oxygen requirement, improved mobility, and avoidance of nasal cannula-related complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60760 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76455 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not initiate TTO therapy in patients who are in acute respiratory distress, medically unstable, or have unsuitable anatomy. It also should not be initiated in patients who cannot consistently perform their own catheter care, are noncompliant with medical care, have severe upper airway obstruction, or have severe anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTO therapy is usually initiated using the Spofford Christopher Oxygen Optimizing Program (SCOOP), which consists of four distinct phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63083 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74858\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74858 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57966 \">table 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65577\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65577 \">table 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that the tracheocutaneous fistula be created using the Lipkin procedure, rather than the modified Seldinger technique (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Phase II'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most complications of TTO therapy are minor, including subcutaneous emphysema, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, mucus collection, local chondritis, lost tracheocutaneous fistulas, and infections.
