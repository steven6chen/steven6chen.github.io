It results in endometritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, peritonitis, perihepatitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tubo-ovarian abscess.</p><p>The majority of PID cases (85 percent) are caused by sexually transmitted pathogens or bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens. Fewer than 15 percent of acute PID cases are not sexually transmitted and instead are associated with enteric (eg, <em>Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis</em>, Group B streptococci, and <em>Campylobacter</em> spp) or respiratory pathogens (eg, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, Group A streptococci, and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) that have colonized the lower genital tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Post-operative pelvic cellulitis and abscess, pregnancy-related pelvic infection, injury or trauma-related pelvic infection, and pelvic infection secondary to spread of another infection (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis, tumor) can also produce a very similar clinical picture. However, the etiologic differences among these processes, principally in that they are not caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), have significant implications for treatment and prevention. Infectious complications of gynecologic surgery and pregnancy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posthysterectomy pelvic abscess&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-pelvic-thrombophlebitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-endometritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum endometritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PID represents a spectrum of infection and there is no single diagnostic gold standard. Clinical diagnosis remains the most important practical approach. Several expert guidelines discuss the clinical approach to the diagnosis of PID. These include the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on the management of STIs, the International Union against STI European guidelines for the management of PID, and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV guidelines on the management of PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The discussion in this topic is generally consistent with these guidelines. </p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of sexually transmitted PID will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, microbiology, risk factors for acquisition, treatment, and sequelae associated with this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854376402\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients at risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any sexually active female is at risk for sexually transmitted infection (STI) associated pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), but those with multiple sexual partners are at the highest risk. Additionally, age younger than 25, a partner with a sexually transmitted infection, and a history of prior PID or a sexually transmitted infection are important risk factors. The use of barrier contraception is protective. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Pathogenesis, microbiology, and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.) </p><p>While it is rare to have PID during pregnancy because the mucus plug and decidua seal off the uterus from ascending bacteria, PID can occur in the first 12 weeks of gestation before this occurs.</p><p>Women who undergo instrumentation of the cervix (eg, termination of pregnancy) are at higher risk of infection ascending to cause PID. Older women less commonly present with PID, but when they do, the cause is more likely to be non-STI related. Salpingitis has been reported in premenarcheal girls and adolescents who are not sexually active, but it is very rare. In such situations, respiratory and enteric bacteria should be also considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854376526\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term PID encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. The time course of presentation is typically acute over several days, but a more indolent presentation over weeks to months can also occur. Some women do not present to care with symptoms of PID but are later suspected to have had it because of tubal factor infertility. Even acute symptomatic PID represents a spectrum of clinical disease, from mild, vague pelvic symptoms to tubo-ovarian abscess and, rarely, fatal intra-abdominal sepsis. In some women, the inflammatory process can extend to the liver capsule to cause perihepatitis (the Fitz-Hugh Curtis syndrome). </p><p>These varied clinical syndromes are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854376435\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute symptomatic PID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute symptomatic PID is characterized by the acute onset of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, pelvic organ tenderness, and evidence of inflammation of the genital tract. The findings can be subtle and nonspecific. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854376396\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower abdominal pain is the cardinal presenting symptom in women with PID. The abdominal pain is usually bilateral and rarely of more than two weeks' duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The character of the pain is variable, and in some cases, may be quite subtle. The recent onset of pain that worsens during coitus or with jarring movement may be the only presenting symptom of PID. The onset of pain during or shortly after menses is particularly suggestive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The majority of women with PID have mild to moderate disease and only a minority develop peritonitis or pelvic abscess, which are usually manifest by more severe pain, greater tenderness on examination, and systemic features such as fever.</p><p>Abnormal uterine bleeding (post-coital bleeding, inter-menstrual bleeding, menorrhagia) occurs in one-third or more of patients with PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Other non-specific complaints include urinary frequency and abnormal vaginal discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854376429\"><span class=\"h3\">Examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On physical examination, most women with PID have abdominal tenderness on palpation, greatest in the lower quadrants, which may or may not be symmetrical. Rebound tenderness, fever, and decreased bowel sounds are usually limited to women with more severe PID.</p><p>Acute cervical motion, uterine, and adnexal tenderness on bimanual pelvic examination are the defining characteristic of acute symptomatic PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Purulent endocervical discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal discharge is also common. However, significant lateralization of adnexal tenderness is uncommon in PID. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112643009\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most laboratory findings in PID are nonspecific. Although PID is usually an acute process, only a minority of PID patients with more severe disease exhibit peripheral blood leukocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similarly, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have poor sensitivity and specificity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112643159\"><span class=\"h3\">Perihepatitis</span></p><p>Perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh Curtis Syndrome) occurs in the setting of PID when there is inflammation of the liver capsule and peritoneal surfaces of the anterior right upper quadrant. There is generally minimal stromal hepatic involvement. It occurs in approximately 10 percent of women with acute PID and is characterized by right upper quadrant abdominal pain with a distinct pleuritic component, sometimes referred to the right shoulder. Marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant can be seen on exam. The severity of the pain in this location may mask the diagnosis of PID and lead to concerns regarding cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Aminotransferases are usually normal or only slightly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>On laparoscopy or visual inspection, perihepatitis manifests as a patchy purulent and fibrinous exudate (&quot;violin string&quot; adhesions), most prominently affecting the anterior surfaces of the liver (not the liver parenchyma). </p><p>The syndrome was first associated with gonococcal salpingitis in 1920 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and subsequently with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112643311\"><span class=\"h3\">Tubo-ovarian abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tubo-ovarian abscess is an inflammatory mass involving the fallopian tube, ovary, and, occasionally, other adjacent pelvic organs. Women with a tubo-ovarian abscess may have a palpable adnexal mass on examination. Other associated clinical findings are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H2672637\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Subclinical PID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subclinical infection of the upper reproductive tract that does not prompt a woman to present to medical care but is severe enough to produce significant sequelae appears to be relatively common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Women with tubal factor infertility that appears likely to have been a result of past episodes of PID often give no history of PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. As an example, in one study of 112 infertile women, 36 had adhesions or distal tube occlusion on laparoscopy suggestive of PID, but only 11 had a documented history of a PID diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Previously undiagnosed PID has also been identified in women with a history of previous mild symptoms, but with an endometrial biopsy that demonstrates excess neutrophils and plasma cells, consistent with inflammation and PID. Lower genital tract infection with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or bacterial vaginosis is a risk factor for this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As an example, in a study that included 562 women at risk for but without clinical findings suggestive of PID, 13 percent of them had endometritis on endometrial biopsy, and rates of cervical <em>C. trachomatis</em> isolation were similar to women with clinically evident PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Subclinical episodes of PID may occur more frequently in oral contraceptive users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854376469\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic PID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An indolent presentation of PID with low-grade fever, weight loss, and abdominal pain has been reported with actinomycosis and tuberculosis. An association between an indwelling IUD and risk of actinomycosis has been suggested, although this relationship remains unclear. The diagnosis of this pathogen is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-actinomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal actinomycosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of miliary tuberculosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854376671\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the woman with acute pelvic pain is discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>). Elements of the evaluation that are specific to female patients with suspected PID are outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854375999\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PID should be suspected in any young or sexually active female patient who presents with lower abdominal pain and pelvic discomfort. The index of suspicion for PID should be high, especially in adolescents. The goal of the initial evaluation of women with suspected PID is to establish a presumptive clinical diagnosis of PID, assess for additional findings that increase the likelihood of that diagnosis, and evaluate for other potential causes of pelvic pain. </p><p>A presumptive clinical diagnosis of PID can be made on the basis of history and physical exam findings alone. Although laboratory testing is also done at the initial evaluation of all patients with suspected PID, empiric treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results of these supportive tests. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.)</p><p>For women who are acutely ill and may have complications of PID, who do not improve with empiric therapy for PID, or in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain, additional diagnostic tests, such as pelvic imaging, can be useful. (See <a href=\"#H1191299333\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation for diagnostic uncertainty'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191299254\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should focus on potential risk factors for PID. In particular, a sexual history should be taken, assessing for new sexual partners and consistent use of condoms.</p><p>Additionally, the history should clarify the onset (usually recent) and character of pelvic pain (usually constant and aching), with the understanding that even subtle and mild symptoms can be consistent with PID (see <a href=\"#H854376396\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above). Other symptoms such as prominent urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms that might indicate alternative diagnoses should also be sought. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854377289\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical and pelvic exam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women suspected of having PID should undergo bimanual exam to evaluate for cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness. Additionally, speculum exam should be performed to evaluate for cervical mucopurulent discharge. (See <a href=\"#H854376429\" class=\"local\">'Examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p>Pelvic organ tenderness is the defining characteristic of acute symptomatic PID. One study found that adnexal tenderness was the sign that correlated best with the finding of endometritis on endometrial biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other diagnoses should also be considered if uterine and adnexal tenderness are not prominent. </p><p>The presence of a palpable adnexal mass may suggest a tubo-ovarian abscess complicating PID, but it could also reflect other disease processes in the differential diagnosis of PID. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854376044\"><span class=\"h3\">Point-of-care and laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following tests should be performed for all women suspected of having PID:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopy of vaginal discharge (where available)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NAATs for <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> (where available)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV screening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing for syphilis</p><p/><p>Testing for patients suspected of PID should always begin with a pregnancy test to rule out ectopic pregnancy and complications of an intrauterine pregnancy, the main obstetric differential diagnoses of PID. Saline microscopy of vaginal discharge is to assess for increased white blood cells (WBC) in vaginal fluid which is sensitive for PID. The absence of WBC could thus suggest an alternate diagnosis. However, the finding is not very specific for PID. Microscopy can also identify coexisting bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. Positive NAATs for <em>C. trachomatis,</em> <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, or <em>M. genitalium</em> support the diagnosis of PID, but negative NAATs do not rule out PID. HIV and syphilis testing are to evaluate for other sexually transmitted infections that share similar risk factors with PID. </p><p>Additional tests can be potentially useful in certain situations. A Gram stain from cervical discharge can also be a useful diagnostic tool, but is often not available in community settings. If a cervical Gram stain is positive for gram-negative intracellular diplococci (suggestive of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>) when interpreted by an experienced microscopist, the probability of PID greatly increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, if the Gram stain is negative, it is of limited value because most cases of PID are not caused by gonorrhoea, and the sensitivity of microscopy is only around 60 percent. </p><p>A complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein are often obtained in patients seen in hospital-based settings who have more severe clinical presentations, including fever, and may warrant inpatient therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These tests have low sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PID in general, but can be useful in assessing severity (including cases of suspected tubo-ovarian abscess) and monitoring the response to treatment. Urinalysis is also checked in women with urinary symptoms. Hepatitis B virus testing may be appropriate depending on the patient's risk history and vaccination history.</p><p>Testing for <em>M. genitalium</em> is useful to help guide the choice of specific antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma genitalium infection in men and women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191299333\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional evaluation for diagnostic uncertainty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional testing may be warranted for women who are acutely ill (eg, with fever, peritonitis, or a pelvic mass), whose symptoms are atypical (eg, with an abnormal site or duration of symptoms) or do not improve significantly within 72 hours after starting empiric antibiotic therapy, or who have persisting pain after completing therapy. These findings suggest the possibility of complications of PID (such as a tubo-ovarian abscess) or alternate diagnosis. Pelvic imaging can be helpful to evaluate for these. Ultrasound is generally the preferred imaging modality if an abscess or adnexal pathology is suspected clinically, as it produces high-quality images of the upper genital tract and does not expose the patient to radiation. Otherwise, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be more helpful in identifying gastrointestinal pathology or alternate diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H854376173\" class=\"local\">'Imaging techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>Laparoscopy and transcervical endometrial biopsy are uncommonly performed.

However, the absence of radiographic findings consistent with PID does not rule out the possibility of PID and should not be a reason to forgo or delay therapy for presumptive PID. Ultrasound is the imaging technique that has been most studied for the evaluation of PID. There is limited evidence for the use of CT or MRI in women with suspected PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]; however, they are useful to exclude alternative diagnoses in women with an atypical and severe presentation.</p><p>The interpretation of sonographic findings are operator-dependent, and there are often minimal changes seen in women with uncomplicated PID. Thickened, fluid-filled fallopian tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and the cogwheel sign (cogwheel appearance on a cross-section of the tube) may be present. Among women who have endometritis, ultrasound may show fluid or gas within the endometrial canal, heterogeneous thickening, or indistinctness of the endometrial stripe, but these findings are inconsistent. When a tubo-ovarian abscess is present, a complex thick-walled, multilocular cystic collection can be seen in the adnexa, typically with internal echoes or multiple fluid levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H6972017\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>Doppler ultrasound scanning may be useful to identify areas of increased blood flow associated with inflammation but is not used routinely because of the limited evidence to support its utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on laparoscopy or transcervical endometrial biopsy can confirm the clinical diagnosis of PID, but these tests are uncommonly performed. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laparoscopy</strong> &mdash; Despite its value in confirming a diagnosis of PID, laparoscopy is not sensitive enough to be considered the diagnostic gold standard. The specificity of laparoscopy is high, but its sensitivity is as low as 50 percent when compared with fimbrial histopathology because it does not detect isolated endometritis or mild intra-tubal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Additionally, it is an invasive procedure, particularly for a condition that does not typically warrant surgical intervention, and it is not universally available in the acute setting. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Laparoscopy can be a useful part of the diagnostic workup for PID when imaging studies have not been definitively informative in the following situations:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a patient who has failed outpatient treatment for PID, to look for alternative causes of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a patient whose symptoms are not clearly improving or worsening after approximately 72 hours of inpatient treatment for PID, which suggests that PID may not be the correct diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, some surgeons may proceed directly to laparoscopy in an acutely ill patient with a high suspicion of a competing diagnosis that would be diagnosed and intervened on through laparoscopy (eg, appendicitis). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Consent for laparotomy at the same procedure should be obtained in advance for these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transcervical endometrial biopsy</strong> &mdash; This can be used to detect endometritis, which is associated with salpingitis. However, it is not used routinely because the correlation is not 100 percent, there is a delay associated with processing the biopsy (which means that the result seldom influences the decision to treat), and there is difficulty in interpreting the histology due to the patchy nature of the inflammation, thus limiting consistency.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presumptive clinical diagnosis of PID is made in sexually active young women, especially women at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), who present with pelvic or lower abdominal pain and have evidence of cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on exam. </p><p>The sensitivity of this clinical diagnosis is only 65 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,28,29</a>], but because of the potential for serious reproductive sequelae if PID treatment is delayed or not given, this presumptive diagnosis is sufficient to warrant empiric antimicrobial therapy for PID. Even patients with minimal or subtle findings should be treated since the potential consequences of withholding therapy are great. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.) </p><p>In general, adding more diagnostic criteria increases the specificity, but decreases the sensitivity of the diagnosis.

Any sexually active female individual is at risk for PID, but those with multiple sexual partners are at the highest risk. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term PID encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Women with acute symptomatic PID generally complain of recent onset of lower abdominal pain in association with new vaginal discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intermenstrual bleeding. Constitutional symptoms may occur and include fever and chills. Perihepatitis can also occur and present with marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Pelvic organ tenderness on palpation is the defining exam finding. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PID should be suspected in any young or sexually active female patient who presents with pelvic discomfort. The index of suspicion for PID should be high, especially in adolescents. The goal of the initial evaluation of women with suspected PID is to establish a presumptive clinical diagnosis of PID, assess for additional findings that increase the likelihood of that diagnosis, and evaluate for other potential causes of pelvic pain. Additionally, infections or co-morbidities that can occur in women at risk for PID should be tested for. (See <a href=\"#H854375999\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to a history, including sexual history, and physical and pelvic exams, the following tests should be performed:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pregnancy test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Microscopy of vaginal discharge (where available)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nucleic acid amplification tests for <em>C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae,</em> and <em>M. genitalium</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HIV screening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serologic testing for syphilis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are acutely ill, who do not improve with empiric therapy for PID, or in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain, imaging is warranted to evaluate for complications of PID (eg, tubo-ovarian abscess) or alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H1191299333\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation for diagnostic uncertainty'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presumptive clinical diagnosis of PID is made in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) who present with pelvic or lower abdominal pain and have evidence of cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on exam. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the potential for serious reproductive sequelae if PID treatment is delayed or not given, this presumptive diagnosis is sufficient to warrant empiric antimicrobial therapy for PID.

Although not obtained in all patients, imaging studies with characteristic findings, laparoscopy abnormalities consistent with PID, and histologic evidence of endometritis on biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis.
