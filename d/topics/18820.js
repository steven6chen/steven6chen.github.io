The trial was stopped early for futility; triple antiplatelet therapy did not reduce the incidence or severity of recurrent stroke or TIA at 90 days but did increase the risk of major bleeding. We continue to recommend early aspirin treatment for most patients with noncardioembolic acute ischemic stroke or TIA; short-term dual antiplatelet therapy remains preferred for symptomatic intracranial large artery disease.

Compared with aspirin alone, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced cardiovascular mortality and ischemic stroke but not myocardial infarction. There were more major bleeding events in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group, while the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was comparable with aspirin. The cardiovascular outcome was not different comparing rivaroxaban alone with aspirin alone, but there was more bleeding with rivaroxaban.

In earlier randomized controlled trials, point estimates suggested that percutaneous device closure of a PFO in patients &le;60 years of age was more effective than antiplatelet therapy for reducing recurrent stroke, but the findings did not reach statistical significance. However, the results of three recent randomized trials, RESPECT extended follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-neurology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], REDUCE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-neurology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and CLOSE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-neurology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], provide stronger evidence that device closure of a PFO plus antiplatelet therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy alone for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke in such patients, with absolute risk reductions ranging from 2.2 to 6 percent. Based upon these results, we now suggest percutaneous PFO closure in addition to antiplatelet therapy for patients who meet all of the following criteria: age &le;60 years, embolic-appearing cryptogenic ischemic stroke (ie, no evident source of stroke despite a comprehensive evaluation), and a PFO with a right-to-left interatrial shunt detected by bubble study.

The guideline emphasizes the importance of appropriate diagnosis of MCI in order to assess for reversible causes of cognitive impairment, help patients and families understand the cause of their cognitive concerns, discuss prognostic implications with regard to dementia risk, and help plan for the future. Neuropsychological testing is recommended in patients who screen positive for MCI by history and brief office-based cognitive testing. An assessment for functional impairment is essential to help distinguish MCI from dementia.

In a prospective study of 64 men with newly diagnosed testicular cancer who underwent orchiectomy, patients underwent baseline and six-month follow-up neurocognitive testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning which provided data to construct theoretical brain structure networks that process and integrate information across the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-neurology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Twenty-two men received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and 42 had surveillance only. At six-month follow-up, compared with the surveillance group, men who had chemotherapy exhibited altered neuronal integrity and disruption of structural networks, as well as poorer cognitive performance. Patients with lower cognitive reserve appeared to be more vulnerable to these changes and to post-chemotherapy cognitive decline.

In an open-label randomized trial of 695 adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, median survival was improved in patients assigned to wear the device during the adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> phase of standard chemoradiation compared with those assigned to standard chemoradiation alone (21 versus 16 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-neurology/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Given the magnitude of potential benefit, we discuss the option of TTFields in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Use of the device is encouraged in interested patients, although the requirement to carry a device and maintain a shaved scalp for the duration of treatment presents a potential burden that is not acceptable to all patients.

Although response rates and progression-free survival were improved by the addition of bevacizumab, adverse event rates were also higher, and overall survival was similar between the two arms (9.1 versus 8.6 months). Outside of a clinical trial, we suggest single-agent therapy with bevacizumab, lomustine, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> in most patients selected for systemic therapy.

Although there was an increased risk for a mental health disorder or developmental delay in children with anesthesia exposure (hazard ratios 1.26 to 1.31), there was no difference in risk between the different age cohorts.

Gene therapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cells is emerging as a possible alternative treatment. A study of 17 boys with early-stage cerebral ALD enrolled to undergo transplantation with autologous CD34+ cells transfected with Lenti-D (a lentiviral vector containing manufactured<em> ABCD1</em> complementary DNA) reported 88 percent were alive with no major functional disabilities at 24 months posttransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-neurology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. One boy died from disease progression that began during pretransplantation conditioning, and one was withdrawn from the study and died from complications of subsequent allogeneic HCT. None of the survivors had evidence of graft failure or graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy may be as effective as, and safer than, HCT for treatment of early cerebral ALD. The treatment has not received regulatory approval. The clinical trial is ongoing and important uncertainties remain.

In a series of 40 children with narcolepsy type 1 who underwent video polysomnography, nearly one-third of patients exhibited motor behaviors during REM sleep ranging from classic dream enactment (eg, vigorous reaching or throwing movements) to more calm, slow pantomime-like events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-neurology/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
