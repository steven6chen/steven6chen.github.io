In addition, adjunctive psychotherapy is generally regarded as essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Fewer studies have been conducted in pediatric bipolar patients than adult patients; thus, treatment is often based upon adult studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, response to specific medications may differ between youth and adults.</p><p>Although pharmacotherapy is indicated for nearly all youth with bipolar disorder, approximately one-third of patients do not receive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, an eight-year prospective observational study enrolled youth with mania who were treated in the community (n = 115), and found that antimanic medications (antipsychotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>, or anticonvulsants) were never prescribed to 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In addition, the wrong medication regimen is frequently administered to children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. A retrospective study found that among bipolar patients who were treated for mania with or without mixed features (n = 282), antidepressant monotherapy was prescribed for 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the choice of treatment for pediatric bipolar disorder.

During periods of significant impairment or elevated risk of suicidal or dangerous behavior, inpatient, intermediate levels of care (eg, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient programs, or in-home services), or frequent outpatient visits and phone contact may be required. When indicated, higher levels of care can provide a safer treatment environment, closer monitoring of symptoms and side effects, more frequent adjustments of pharmacotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more intensive psychotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109663768\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PHARMACOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A separate topic discusses the general principles for treating pediatric bipolar disorder with pharmacotherapy, including the role of the pediatrician; assessing patients prior to treatment; prescribing medications to age appropriate patients; indications for pharmacotherapy (and electroconvulsive therapy); using monotherapy, medication combinations, and drugs that may destabilize patients; administering medications as part of comprehensive treatment; monitoring patient progress; the duration of an adequate drug trial; and information for patients and families.

Patients receive initial pharmacotherapy and progress through each step until they respond. The duration of an adequate treatment trial is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles#H428761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy: General principles&quot;, section on 'Duration of an adequate trial'</a>.)</p><p>The primary treatments that are suggested for pediatric mania, either as monotherapy or combination therapy, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-generation antipsychotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lithium</a> </p><p/><p>In addition, psychotherapy is nearly always indicated as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H5072309\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive psychotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Following response to acute treatment, patients receive maintenance treatment to prevent recurrences. (See <a href=\"#H10835695\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10835632\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial pharmacotherapy for pediatric mania is a second-generation antipsychotic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asenapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">asenapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ziprasidone</a>. The efficacy and tolerability of these drugs has been established in many studies, including 10 randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/7-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-16</a>]. As an example, an eight-week open-label trial in youth with mania or mixed mania (n = 279) found that improvement was greater with risperidone, compared with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a> or divalproex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Based upon randomized trials, clinicians can expect that remission with second-generation antipsychotics will occur in approximately 25 to 70 percent of patients, and response (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) in 50 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/7-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-16</a>]. The use of second-generation antipsychotics for mania is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/1,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-19</a>] as well as common clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>No head-to-head randomized trials have compared different second-generation antipsychotics in children and adolescents with mania; across separate trials, the clinical effect of these drugs appears to be comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The specific choice thus depends on factors such as past response to medications, side effect profiles, comorbidities, potential drug-drug interactions, patient preference, and cost. As an example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrapyramidal symptoms may occur less often with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">quetiapine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a> than other atypical antipsychotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperprolactinemia may occur more often with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> than other second-generation antipsychotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and hyperlipidemia, appear to be more pronounced with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a> than other atypical antipsychotics, and least likely to occur in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ziprasidone</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with risk factors for or a history of cardiac disease generally do not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ziprasidone</a> because the drug may prolong the QTc interval. </p><p/><p>The efficacy, administration, monitoring, and side effects of second-generation antipsychotics in pediatric mania are discussed separately.

(Response is defined as substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms.) The failed medication is generally tapered by the same amount for each dose decrease. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">quetiapine</a> 300 mg per day is decreased by 50 mg per day, every one to three days. We generally attempt two or three trials of antipsychotics before proceeding to next-step treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10835639\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment resistant patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric mania often does not respond to multiple (eg, two to three) trials of second-generation antipsychotics. For these treatment resistant patients, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>. For patients who responded partially to initial treatment with an antipsychotic, we add lithium to the antipsychotic. For patients who demonstrate little or no response to antipsychotics, we taper and discontinue the antipsychotic over one to two weeks, and at the same time start lithium and titrate the dose up. </p><p>Prior to starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>, clinicians should obtain laboratory tests that include blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone), and an electrocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. These tests establish a baseline for monitoring lithium&rsquo;s long-term effects upon the kidneys, thyroid gland, and heart, and ruling out contraindications to using lithium. These long-term side effects and contraindications are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults and lithium: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Females of childbearing potential should be informed of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>&rsquo;s teratogenic effects, and a urine pregnancy test should be obtained prior to initiating lithium and whenever there is a possibility that a patient is pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/1,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teratogenicity-pregnancy-complications-and-postnatal-risks-of-antipsychotics-benzodiazepines-lithium-and-electroconvulsive-therapy#H1561534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Teratogenicity, pregnancy complications, and postnatal risks of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, lithium, and electroconvulsive therapy&quot;, section on 'Lithium'</a>.) </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lithium</a> is often started in children and adolescents at a dose of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> in two or three divided doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, a reasonable alternative is to initiate treatment at 15 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in patients who are concerned about side effects. Another alternative in youth weighing &lt;30 kg is to initiate lithium at a dose of 300 mg twice daily, and in youth weighing &ge;30 kg to start treatment at a dose of 300 mg three times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lithium</a> serum concentrations are measured after the first week of treatment, and doses are titrated up by 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every four to seven days, depending upon response and tolerability, as well as serum levels. The target serum concentration is 0.6 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.6 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Serum levels at the higher end of the target range appear to provide better symptom control, but also cause more adverse effects. Doses of immediate release preparations &ge;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> are administered in three divided doses, and doses &lt;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in two divided doses; clinicians should attempt to avoid prescribing more than 900 mg at any one time because the tolerability of high single doses is frequently poor. Extended-release preparations are usually given twice per day, but can be administered once daily.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lithium</a> serum concentrations are measured four to seven days after each dose change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Lithium levels are drawn approximately 12 hours after the last dose (12-hour serum trough level), and generally collected in the morning before the first dose of the day. However, levels drawn 11 to 13 hours after the last dose, or even 10 to 14 hours, provide meaningful information. By contrast, serum levels drawn a few hours after lithium ingestion provide less meaningful information. </p><p>After a stable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a> dose is achieved, we repeat the blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, thyrotropin, and electrocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/1,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,23</a>]. Subsequently, lithium serum concentrations, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and thyrotropin are measured every three to six months. &#160;</p><p>The most common side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a> in children and adolescents are gastrointestinal (such as pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/22,23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,27</a>]. Other side effects can include an acne-like rash, tremor, sedation, slowed mentation, hypothyroidism, weight gain, polyuria, polydipsia, and possible structural renal changes from long-term use. As an example, a randomized trial found that between baseline and week 8, the prevalence of abdominal pain in patients treated with lithium (n = 84) increased from 6 to 41 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, excessive thirst increased from 4 to 44 percent of patients, mean serum concentration of thyrotropin more than doubled (from 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> and patients gained an average of 1.4 kg. (However, another eight-week trial found that weight gain with lithium and placebo was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].) It may be possible to ameliorate adverse gastrointestinal effects by administering the drug with food, dividing the dose more frequently (eg, four doses per day), or using extended-release or liquid citrate formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Hypothyroidism is managed by adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levothyroxine</a> or switching from lithium to a different drug. Additional information about adverse effects is discussed separately in the context of adults.

Factors to consider include prior response to medication discontinuation, how many years the patient has had bipolar disorder, and the lifetime number and severity of mood episodes. Maintenance treatment should last longer for patients with a more severe course of illness. Although intolerable side effects may truncate maintenance treatment altogether, clinicians should first try to find better tolerated alternatives.</p><p>Some patients are discouraged by the prospect of taking their medication &quot;forever.&quot; In such cases, it is important to emphasize the long-term nature of the relationship between the clinician and patient, and that the need for maintenance treatment will periodically be reevaluated in light of the patient's progress in maintaining symptomatic and functional stability.

The first drug to be removed is generally the adjuvant; if both drugs are considered essential, the first drug to be stopped is the one most likely to cause side effects with long-term use. </p><p>During the process of tapering and discontinuing pharmacotherapy, clinicians should monitor patients regularly (eg, every two to four weeks) for prodromal symptoms of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prospective observational studies in adults show that tapering maintenance medication more slowly is associated with lower rates of recurrence, but that most patients suffer a recurrence despite the slower taper.
