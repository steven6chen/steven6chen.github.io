However, studies in adults show that T2DM and its comorbidities are important risk factors for adult vascular disease. As a result, it is likely that identifying and treating children and adolescents with T2DM will improve long-term outcome; however, pediatric-onset T2DM differs from adult onset disease, especially regarding durability of glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>There are few studies examining the management of T2DM in the pediatric age group. The largest clinical trial, Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY study), suggests that oral agent monotherapy does not maintain durable glycemic control in about 50 percent of those with adolescent-onset T2DM (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> below), and an A1c &gt;6.3 percent in females and &gt;5.6 percent in males following initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> monotherapy predicts glycemic deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Thus, it is important to optimize treatment using a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, with close monitoring and follow-up.</p><p>Ideally, the care of an adolescent with T2DM should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including an endocrinologist, nurse educator, dietitian, mental health professional, and sometimes an exercise physiologist. However, in locations where these resources are not available, many patients can be effectively managed by primary care clinicians, following the guidelines outlined in this topic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Patients in need of insulin therapy should be managed by or in consultation with an endocrinologist, if at all possible. Family involvement is essential to initiate and support the lifestyle changes required in the management of a pediatric patient with this disorder. </p><p>The management of T2DM in children and adolescents is presented here. The epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, comorbidities, and complications of pediatric T2DM are discussed separately.

Nutritional goals, as outlined by guidelines from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Diabetes Association include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,13</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve glycemic control by balancing food intake with physical activity.

The dietitian can provide instruction on how to adjust dietary habits and behaviors to ensure adequate nutrition while reducing caloric intake. Consultation with a dietitian is particularly important for patients who do not achieve good glycemic control in the initial phases of treatment and require intensification of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Dietary prescription'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children and adolescents with T2DM, the optimal goal for body weight is a body mass index (BMI) &lt;85<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and gender. Excessive weight causes peripheral insulin resistance and decreases insulin-mediated glucose uptake, which, in turn, places greater demands upon the already stressed insulin-producing beta cells. In adults with T2DM, weight loss reduces insulin resistance and improves insulin secretion. Similar benefits of weight reduction are seen in the pediatric age group. In obese children without T2DM, decreases in BMI of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or more lead to improvements in insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Furthermore, in a series of adolescent patients with T2DM treated with very low-calorie diets for one to four months, BMI dropped from 43.5 to 39.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> hemoglobin A1C (A1C) decreased from 8.8 to 7.4 percent , and pharmacologic agents were discontinued in all but one of the 20 subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>In children, the decision to recommend weight reduction versus weight maintenance depends on the age of the patient (ie, the potential for linear growth), the degree of obesity, and the presence of comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In patients who are still growing, weight maintenance will lead to a reduction in BMI. However, for most youth with T2DM, weight reduction rather than weight maintenance is indicated. This is because most youth with T2DM are at least 12 years old and have severe obesity, and their T2DM warrants an intensive approach to weight management.</p><p>Although the goal is weight reduction, it is prudent to approach this goal stepwise. For many patients and families, it may be appropriate to set an initial goal of weight maintenance. After successful weight maintenance, further dietary intervention can focus on gradual weight loss to reach a BMI &lt;85th percentile. A weight loss rate of 0.5 to 1 kg per month is a reasonable goal for growing youth. Adolescents who have completed puberty should have a weight loss goal of about 0.5 to 1 kg per week, which is the same weight loss goal recommended for adults with T2DM.</p><p>The effects of weight loss surgery on glycemic control is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Surgical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary prescription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although dietary prescriptions for patients with diabetes have traditionally used meal planning (ie, patient receives recommendations for the number of servings to consume from the different food groups), this approach is often difficult to follow long-term. In addition, meal planning can place too much focus on the child, while detracting from the importance of family changes in eating.</p><p>Dietary treatment for children with obesity, with or without T2DM, focuses on a gradual change of family and individual dietary habits to better achieve long-term goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. The dietary counseling begins by determining the patient's and family's dietary preferences, patterns of physical activity, as well as sedentary behaviors (&quot;screen time&quot;), family time and financial constraints, cultural background, and educational level. Once sufficient data are obtained, the counselor can begin to give advice to move the patient toward a more healthful diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-childhood-obesity-in-the-primary-care-setting#H11301683\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of childhood obesity in the primary care setting&quot;, section on 'Diet'</a>.)</p><p>Patients are most likely to adhere to a diet that is adapted to their preferences and habits.

It improves insulin responsiveness by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues, and also by decreasing hepatic glucose production. Metformin has the additional benefit of producing modest weight loss; this is in contrast to the weight gain often associated with insulin, thiazolidinedione, or sulfonylurea therapy.

Insulin therapy is helpful for these patients because they have inadequate insulin production (due to impaired beta cell function), in addition to insulin resistance.

After a run-in period of two to six months, in which all study subjects received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> alone and standard diabetes education that included attention to healthful eating and exercise and achieved a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of &lt;8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: metformin alone, metformin plus the insulin sensitizer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rosiglitazone</a>, or metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention. Metformin was titrated to 1000 mg twice daily and rosiglitazone to 4 mg twice daily. The intensive lifestyle intervention was focused on weight loss through family-focused efforts at healthy eating and exercise behaviors, delivered during face-to-face counseling sessions for the first two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Treatment failure &ndash; The primary outcome of the TODAY study was treatment failure (loss of glycemic control), defined as A1C &ge;8 percent for at least six months or sustained metabolic decompensation requiring insulin for three months or more, and was the primary study outcome. During the TODAY study treatment period (mean 3.8 duration years, with a range from 2 to 6.5 years), 45.6 percent of study participants experienced treatment failure, with a median time to treatment failure of 11.5 months. The rates of treatment failure were higher than in comparable studies in adults; this was not thought to be due to nonadherence to the study drugs. </p><p>The following glycemic control outcomes were seen in each treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> alone &ndash; 51.7 percent treatment failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> with intensive lifestyle intervention &ndash; 46.6 percent treatment failure (not significantly different from metformin alone or metformin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rosiglitazone</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rosiglitazone</a> &ndash; 38.6 percent treatment failure </p><p/><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rosiglitazone</a> group experienced 25 percent less glycemic failure compared with metformin alone. However, we do not recommend use of rosiglitazone or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> in youth with type 2 diabetes, because of the restrictions on the use of thiazolidinediones mandated by the United States Food and Drug administration (FDA), due to cardiovascular concerns with rosiglitazone, bladder cancer concerns with pioglitazone, and bone concerns with both. Thus, the TODAY study results support the need for early combination therapy in some youth with type 2 diabetes. The choice of the second agent, whether it is insulin or another oral or injectable glucose lowering agent, requires additional study. </p><p>Weight gain &ndash; The TODAY study also examined the effects of each treatment on weight status, measured after six months of treatment because this was the predicted time for maximum weight loss. The weight loss target was a decrease of 7 percentage points in percent overweight. After six months, the following weight loss outcomes were seen in each treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> alone &ndash; 24.3 percent reached weight loss target</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> with intensive lifestyle intervention &ndash; 31.2 percent reached weight loss target </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rosiglitazone</a> &ndash; 16.7 percent reached weight loss target </p><p/><p>The percent of participants reaching the weight loss target at six months was significantly higher in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> plus lifestyle intervention group than in the metformin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rosiglitazone</a> group (p &lt;0.001), but not significantly different from metformin alone.

There was one case of transient lactic acidosis in the metformin-only group, associated with an asthma exacerbation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1811614\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals for glycemic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend the goal of strict glycemic control for children and adolescents with T2DM. Strict glycemic control is defined as A1C &lt;7 percent (&lt;53 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> <strong>and</strong> a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of &lt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. If these goals seem unrealistic in the short term for an individual patient, it is reasonable to set a higher target initially (eg, A1C &lt;8 percent [&lt;64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol]),</span> then lower the target as tolerated by the patient. Use of realistic goals may help to engage the patient and promote adherence to medical and lifestyle therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of note, these goals define an ideal target for glycemic control; higher thresholds are used for defining treatment failure and for adding insulin to the pharmacotherapeutic regimen. (See <a href=\"#H11242319\" class=\"local\">'Failure of metformin'</a> below.) </p><p>A1C reflects long-term glycemic control and is typically measured every three months. Although traditionally reported as percent, A1C is increasingly reported as <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-glycemic-assessment-using-conventional-or-si-units-for-hemoglobin-a1c\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Blood glucose can be monitored by the patient and family using capillary samples (finger-sticks) and a glucose meter. Serial measurements of fasting, pre-meal, and inter-prandial blood glucose concentrations provide direct feedback on daily glycemic control that guides ongoing care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimation-of-blood-glucose-control-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimation of blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Maintaining near-normal glycemic control has been shown to decrease the risk of long-term vascular complications in adults with T2DM, and in children and adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In adults with T2DM, a major randomized trial (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS]) demonstrated that strict glycemic control (A1C &le;7 percent) reduced the risk of microvascular complications. Similar data are not available for youth with T2DM, but benefits of strict glycemic control can be inferred from these similar patient groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and screening in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal of strict glycemic control is challenging. In the TODAY study cited above, 6 percent of individuals entering the run-in period were unable to maintain a more modest goal of A1C &lt;8 percent despite adequate adherence to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a>, and were therefore excluded prior to randomization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Among the patients who were able to maintain A1C &lt;8 percent initially, about half failed to maintain this level of glycemic control on oral hypoglycemic agents during the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the following approach to initial management, consistent with the consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. All patients should receive nonpharmacologic therapy, consisting of counseling to support lifestyle changes that are likely to optimize insulin sensitivity, including weight reduction and physical activity (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above). In addition, all patients should be treated with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> or insulin, as outlined below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88489\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88489 \">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8307650\"><span class=\"h3\">Metformin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless contraindicated, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> as initial therapy in most adolescents with T2DM, in conjunction with nonpharmacologic therapy (diet and physical activity). Although the results of the TODAY trial suggest limited efficacy with any approach, most patients will have an initial response to metformin, and about 50 percent of patients will have a sustained response. </p><p>In pediatric patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> is started at an oral dose of 500 mg, administered once a day. The dose can be gradually increased by 500 mg increments at one week intervals until the maximal daily dose of 2000 mg is achieved after four weeks. This is generally given as 1000 mg twice daily, taken with meals to reduce gastrointestinal distress. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> is contraindicated in patients with hepatitis, impaired renal function, cirrhosis, alcoholism, or cardiopulmonary insufficiency because it can cause lactic acidosis in these settings. Therefore, we recommend that baseline liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase, AST) and creatinine be measured before starting metformin therapy. If the liver enzyme levels are greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, or if the serum creatinine is abnormal, we recommend NOT starting metformin. In this situation, insulin therapy should be continued or initiated, and liver enzyme levels should be measured after three to six months. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> should not be used in patients with A1C &gt;13 percent. We suggest beginning metformin only after A1C has been reduced to &lt;12 percent with initial insulin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8307879\" class=\"local\">'Insulin'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> are advised to take a daily multivitamin because the absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> can be compromised. T2DM and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) frequently co-occur. With metformin therapy, females who previously had irregular menses and anovulatory cycles may regain normal menstrual cycles, thereby increasing their risk of unplanned pregnancy. Therefore, all females treated with metformin should be counseled regarding the need for birth control. Patients receiving metformin who are planning to undergo elective surgery should be advised to stop the metformin 24 hours before the surgery and to resume the metformin 48 hours after the procedure, provided there are no complications.

Distinguishing between the two causes of diabetes is based upon clinical presentation, history, and laboratory studies. As an example, if evidence of islet cell autoimmunity is absent and the fasting C-peptide level is &gt;0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> after stabilization (indicating substantial insulin production), then the diabetes is likely to be type 2. However, some patients may have mixed features and are difficult to classify. Such patients usually should be treated with insulin therapy.

The rationale for insulin treatment in these patients is that severe hyperglycemia is toxic to pancreatic islet cells, and treatment with insulin can help to restore endogenous insulin production. &#160;</p><p/><p>Because patients with T2DM are insulin resistant, relatively high doses of insulin are needed to restore glycemic control. A typical starting dose for insulin is in the range of 0.75 to 1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/day</span> but may be as high as 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day. Glycemic control should be evaluated by blood glucose self-monitoring (finger-sticks), and insulin dose adjusted accordingly. Self-monitoring should be performed three or more times daily for patients using multiple daily insulin injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Diagnosis and management of these disorders is an essential component of the complete care of adolescents and adults with T2DM. Details are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H573398332\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY PREVENTION AND RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Teens and young women with T2DM are at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as reported in the TODAY Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of 53 pregnancies, over 53 percent resulted in either pregnancy loss, still birth, prematurity, or major congenital anomaly. Notably, only 4.8 percent of pregnant participants practiced contraception before pregnancy despite recurrent reminders during the clinical trial. These findings highlight the importance of emphasizing adequate contraception as well as providing pregnancy planning to optimize pregnancy outcomes when caring for teens and young women with youth onset T2DM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregestational diabetes: Preconception counseling, evaluation, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severely obese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) benefit from the increased insulin sensitivity and weight reduction that follows weight loss surgery (gastric bypass or adjustable banding). Seventy to 85 percent of adults with T2DM experience remission after gastric bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Moreover, the frequency of remission seems to be inversely related to age at time of surgery, duration of diabetes, and severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. These observations support earlier surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery#H353466713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical outcomes following bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Diabetes mellitus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H1665282\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Surgical treatment of obesity'</a>.)</p><p>Weight loss surgery is occasionally employed to treat severe obesity in adolescents, and outcomes from programs with the most experience show good efficacy and safety. T2DM usually remits after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,35</a>]. As an example, in a report of 29 adolescents with severe obesity and T2DM, the diabetes resolved after weight loss surgery in 95 percent and remained in remission at three years follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Five-year outcomes for a subset of this group documented that T2DM remained in remission in 90 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An analysis comparing glycemic outcomes in an age, sex, and body mass index (BMI)-matched sample of patients in Teen-LABS with participants in the TODAY Study demonstrated superior glycemic control among those treated with bariatric surgery compared with medical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. There were substantially more acute complications in the surgery group. The experience with weight loss surgery in adolescents is limited but growing. Selection criteria for this age group are based on an evolving understanding of the special risks and benefits of surgery for this age group, as discussed separately. There are no long-term data comparing durability of the bariatric surgery on glycemic control and other health outcomes.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend a goal of strict glycemic control for children and adolescents with T2DM (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Our ideal goal for strict glycemic control is maintenance of hemoglobin A1c (A1C) below 7 percent and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Although traditionally reported as percent, A1C is increasingly reported as <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-glycemic-assessment-using-conventional-or-si-units-for-hemoglobin-a1c\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Many patients are unable to maintain this level of glycemic control despite lifestyle modification and oral glucose-lowering medications. (See <a href=\"#H1811614\" class=\"local\">'Goals for glycemic control'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available data indicates that optimal glycemic control is best achieved in most patients by a combination of nonpharmacologic therapy (lifestyle changes) combined with pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88489\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88489 \">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Essential lifestyle changes include reduction of excess weight by decreasing caloric intake while increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentary behaviors (eg, screen time) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88490\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88490 \">table 2</a>). Nutritional goals focus on changing the dietary habits of the patient and family. It is desirable for the family to consult with a registered dietitian who can provide instruction on how to adjust dietary behaviors to reduce caloric intake, using approaches that are sensitive to the family's culture. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> as initial therapy in most adolescents with T2DM. Most patients will have an initial response to metformin, and about 50 percent of patients will have a durable response. AST, ALT, and creatinine concentrations should be measured before beginning metformin. (See <a href=\"#H8307650\" class=\"local\">'Metformin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21976949\" class=\"local\">'TODAY study'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend insulin therapy (rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a>) for patients with ketosis or ketoacidosis, severe hyperglycemia (plasma glucose &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> or A1C &gt;9 percent), or mixed features of T2DM and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

For the occasional more stable patient, this interval can be extended to four to six months. Blood glucose self-monitoring also should be performed fasting and two hours postprandial daily, and more frequently when changing therapy or dosing, or when glycemic control is poor. (See <a href=\"#H8308802\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not meet or make progress towards attaining goals for glycemic control should be managed with intensification of therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In those initially treated with both nonpharmacologic therapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a>, who fail to achieve glycemic targets, we suggest basal insulin analogs (glargine or detemir) as the next therapeutic agent, rather than adding a second oral glucose-lowering agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1812067\" class=\"local\">'Intensification of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bariatric surgery for weight loss may be considered for selected severely obese adolescents with T2DM, particularly if the diabetes is not adequately controlled with pharmacologic intervention.
