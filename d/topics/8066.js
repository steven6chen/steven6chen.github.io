(See <a href=\"#H5861242\" class=\"local\">'Patient/disease/donor factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients under age 50 with severe or very severe AA who have an available donor, we suggest proceeding directly to allogeneic HCT rather than pursuing a course of immunosuppressive therapy. The rationale for early transplantation includes improved outcomes with HCT, especially in younger patients, and concerns about the risks of severe infections, excessive blood product transfusions, and late clonal disorders such as myelodysplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute leukemia with immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults#H1803044\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aplastic anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Overview of approach: IST versus HCT'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Early referral to a transplant center will facilitate timely donor identification and ensure that other pretransplantation issues are addressed. (See <a href=\"#H1513531\" class=\"local\">'Pretransplant testing and interventions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A matched related donor (typically, a sibling) is preferable to an unrelated donor, and a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated donor is preferable to a haploidentical related donor. (See <a href=\"#H5305895\" class=\"local\">'Preferred donor and preparative regimen'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some patients younger than 50 years may have comorbidities that preclude transplantation or affect the ability to tolerate transplantation-associated toxicities; additional individuals may not have an available donor. In such cases, other approaches are needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aplastic anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a donor cannot be found in a timely manner, the search should continue as long as HCT is considered to be a potentially effective therapy for that patient (eg, as long as the patient could tolerate HCT and the disease does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy). Immunosuppressive therapy sometimes may be used during this period because the search for an unrelated donor may take a long time (eg, four months or more), especially if the patient is unstable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients &ge;50 years with severe AA, the decision is more nuanced because some older patients can tolerate the toxicities of potentially curative HCT. Thus, HCT or immunotherapy may be appropriate, depending on disease severity and the availability of a donor. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis that considers the degree of cytopenias, life expectancy, and available less toxic HCT regimens.</p><p/><p>Autologous HCT cannot be used in AA, because sufficient normally functioning hematopoietic cells cannot be collected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5861242\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient/disease/donor factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease severity</strong> &ndash; HCT generally is reserved for individuals with severe aplastic anemia (SAA; eg, bone marrow cellularity &lt;25 percent, bone marrow hypoplasia with absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> or very severe disease (vSAA; ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL)</span>. Patients with SAA or vSAA are more likely to have potentially fatal complications of their disease (eg, infection, bleeding), and their disease is less likely to respond to immunosuppression. In contrast, outcomes with moderate AA are generally better, and use of immunotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supportive care may be preferable to the risks of HCT. Additionally, HCT generally is not pursued until any medications that may have induced AA have been discontinued, viral infections have been treated (eg, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and other possible causes of bone marrow aplasia have been addressed (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, eosinophilic fasciitis, vitamin deficiencies [eg, B12, folate, copper]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072 \">table 1</a>). The evaluation of patients with AA and classification of disease severity is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aplastic anemia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient age</strong> &ndash; Outcomes from HCT historically have been better in younger patients, especially individuals who are &le;20 years of age. However, outcomes have continued to improve in individuals between 20 and 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, HCT is the treatment of choice for patients with SAA &lt;40 to 50 years old who have an HLA-matched related donor (typically a sibling) and lack significant medical comorbidities. HCT may also be appropriate for selected patients older than 50 years with excellent performance status who have an available HLA-matched donor, individuals &lt;40 to 50 years old with a matched unrelated donor, or younger patients with moderately severe disease. Indications based on age may continue to broaden as transplant outcomes improve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comorbidities</strong> &ndash; Patient comorbidities may preclude successful HCT. Examples in the setting of AA include infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal, hepatic, or cardiac dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Donor availability</strong> &ndash; The availability of an HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell donor is paramount in the decision to proceed to HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A related donor is preferable to an unrelated donor with the same degree of HLA matching, due to genetic similarities not assessed by available testing, and closer HLA matching reduces the risks of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (see <a href=\"#H5861256\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below). Another advantage of using an HLA-matched related donor is the greater speed of donor identification. (See <a href=\"#H5862524\" class=\"local\">'HLA-matched sibling donor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>However, outcomes with unrelated donors continue to improve, and for patients without a suitable related donor, a matched unrelated donor may be appropriate if the donor can be identified in a timely manner (eg, within four to six weeks). Improvements in donor recruitment, donor identification, molecular HLA typing, GVHD prevention strategies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> strategies for managing haploidentical donors may result in further expansion of the unrelated donor pool. (See <a href=\"#H5304588\" class=\"local\">'Overview of HCT considerations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941212\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence for efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes with HCT appear to be superior to those achieved with immunosuppressive therapy. However, the potential risks and benefits need to be evaluated for each individual patient, as these may differ from individuals participating in clinical trials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient selection criteria differ among trials and in trials versus a nonclinical trial population.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early outcomes may favor immunosuppression, whereas HCT is more likely to be curative.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Innovations in both HCT and immunosuppression make comparisons with historical controls difficult.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have strong preferences for one therapy or the other because the risks and potential benefits are very different.</p><p/><p>Randomized trials comparing HCT with immunosuppression in AA are lacking. Two meta-analyses that evaluated available evidence (7955 and 302 patients, respectively) found that overall survival either was greater with HCT or was no different from immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Examples of available studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review that compared outcomes in 395 individuals with severe AA who underwent either HCT (mostly bone marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> conditioning without radiation) or immunosuppressive therapy (mostly antithymocyte globulin [ATG] from horse) during the 1990s found greater survival at 15 years in those undergoing transplant (69 versus 38 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75806 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The relative benefit of HCT versus immunosuppressive therapy was greatest in the youngest children, persisted through age 39, and was less apparent in individuals &gt;40 years, although several individuals over age 40 received a transplant (median age 22 years, range 2 to 54 years). The major causes of death due to HCT were GVHD (44 percent [mostly chronic]) and infection (44 percent). In contrast, most deaths in individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy were due to bleeding (37 percent) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infection (38 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence from children with AA has shown good long-term survival with HCT. Specific improvements have been associated with reduced incidence and severity of GVHD, higher rates of engraftment, early transplantation before the onset of severe infections, and avoidance of blood product transfusions from the donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired aplastic anemia in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Outcomes with HCT continue to improve with advances in conditioning regimens, infection prophylaxis and treatment, and GVHD prevention. This was illustrated in a report that compared outcomes in 1305 individuals who received a transplant during the decades between 1976 and 1992, during which survival steadily improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Five-year overall survival increased from 48 percent (1976 to 1980 cohort) to 66 percent (1988 to 1992 cohort). Greater survival was attributed primarily to reduced mortality in the three months immediately following transplantation; institution of CSA for GVHD prevention was the most important intervention.</p><p>Among individuals who undergo HCT for severe AA, outcomes are better with related donors and with bone marrow rather than peripheral blood as the source of stem cells.

Most donors are HLA-matched at 8 of 8 or 10 of 10 HLA alleles (eg, HLA-A, B, C, Dr, and Dq from both parents). A sibling with a single antigen mismatch may also be used, although this is very rare because the HLA genes are linked. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H91590042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Matched related donors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H5889294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Mismatched related donors'</a>.)</p><p>The preparative regimen most frequently used for matched sibling donor transplantation consists of four daily doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for four days, total dose 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> alternating with three doses of antithymocyte globulin (ATG; total 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521450\"><span class=\"h3\">Matched unrelated donor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an HLA-matched related donor is not available, we prefer a matched unrelated donor to a haploidentical donor. Typically, a preliminary search is performed that can provide information about the likelihood of finding a donor. This is followed by additional donor testing including more complete HLA typing, evaluation of donor health, and viral serologies. Additional information regarding the search for an unrelated donor, preferred donor characteristics, and alternative donors is presented separately.

Various strategies have been used, including cyclophosphamide-based conditioning and nonmyeloablative regimens using varying combinations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, irradiation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, and ATG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/6-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-15</a>].

Twenty-three (58 percent) did not receive pretransplant conditioning. While sustained hematologic recovery was more likely in the patients who underwent conditioning, this was not associated with a survival advantage: actuarial 10-year survival was 78 percent, with significantly greater survival being seen in the patients who did not have conditioning before the first transplant (87 versus 70 percent). Most of the patients (15 of 23) who did not receive conditioning before the first transplant required subsequent transplants in which conditioning was performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective observational study on behalf of the Severe Aplastic Anemia and Pediatric Diseases Working Parties of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation reported on the results of 113 syngeneic transplants in 88 patients with AA performed between 1976 and 2009. Transplant practice changed over time, with more individuals in later years receiving ATG as part of pretransplant conditioning, as well as an increasing use of peripheral blood stem cells rather than bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Rates of graft failure were significantly higher in transplants that proceeded without conditioning (64 versus 24 percent in those not receiving or receiving conditioning, respectively) as well as when bone marrow was employed as the source of stem cells (37 versus 16 percent in those receiving bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants, respectively). Lack of post-transplant immunosuppression showed a trend towards an increased risk of graft failure, while the use of ATG did not have an influence.</p><p/><p>When an identical twin is used as a donor, there is no concern regarding GVHD; therefore, peripheral blood can be used as a source of hematopoietic cells.

In patients with AA, HCT using bone marrow has been demonstrated to provide excellent outcomes and a lower risk of GVHD (see <a href=\"#H5861256\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below). Individuals with AA do not have a malignancy and thus do not require a graft-versus-leukemia effect, which is often correlated with GVHD. One exception may be an identical twin donor; in this setting, hematopoietic cells from peripheral blood may be used because there are not concerns regarding GVHD, and engraftment may be more rapid with peripheral blood-derived cells.

The rate of chronic GVHD was also lower in those who received bone marrow (11 versus 22 percent). However, individuals who received bone marrow were also younger, had not received radiation in the conditioning regimen, and had a shorter interval between diagnosis and transplantation, all of which may have contributed to improved survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The EBMT also reported outcomes in 1448 patients with acquired AA who had an HCT between 2005 and 2009, when the use of unrelated donors was greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The strongest predictor of survival was the use of bone marrow rather than peripheral blood as a stem cell source (survival at approximately 10 years, 83 versus 70 percent). This impact of stem cell source exceeded the effects of patient age, interval between diagnosis and HCT, related versus unrelated donor, and use of ATG. The odds ratio (OR) for survival was greater with bone marrow versus peripheral blood regardless of whether the donor was related or unrelated:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any donor: OR 2.04 (95% CI 1.62-2.58)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sibling donor: OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.26-2.42)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unrelated donor: OR 1.47 (95% CI 1.02-2.12)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The overall incidence of GVHD was greater with unrelated donors, but survival was similar between related and unrelated donors after correction for patient age, interval between diagnosis and transplant, stem cell source, use of ATG, and donor and recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) status.</p><p/><p>Additional evidence for the reduced risk of GVHD when bone marrow rather than peripheral blood is used as a source of hematopoietic stem cells comes from a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing stem cell sources in 1521 individuals with a variety of hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The hazard ratio (HR) for chronic GVHD in individuals who received bone marrow was 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.85) and the HR for extensive GVHD was 0.69 (95% CI 0.54-0.9). There was no difference in overall survival, but survival differences are difficult to extrapolate to patients with AA because the issue of disease relapse does not apply.

Thus, HCT or immunotherapy may be appropriate, depending on the need to move forward expeditiously and the availability of a donor. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis that considers disease severity, life expectancy, and available less toxic HCT regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early referral to a transplant center will facilitate timely donor identification and ensure other that other pretransplantation issues are addressed. A potential HCT donor should never be used as a source of blood products (red blood cells or platelets) for transfusion. Transfusions should be minimized, and all blood products should be leukoreduced and cytomegalovirus compatible.
