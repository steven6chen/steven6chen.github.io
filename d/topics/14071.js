The following discussion will review the major clinical and laboratory predictors of survival in patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction. The clinical value of estimating prognosis is unclear since almost all patients with HF are treated with similar drugs. Prognostic factors are often useful in determining eligibility for transplantation and may be useful in selecting patients for intensification of therapy. However, because there is substantial patient-to-patient variability, precise prognosticating for an individual patient is often imprecise.</p><p>The overall prognosis of HF and the predictors in patients with diastolic dysfunction are presented separately.

Many univariate predictors of reduced survival have been identified in HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75049 \">table 1</a>). Identification of these factors should be part of the initial evaluation of any patient with HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most frequently used factors for predicting survival in patients with systolic HF, many of which are direct or indirect measures of the severity of cardiac dysfunction, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of the reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and reduced cardiac index (CI)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant diastolic dysfunction, as established by a mitral flow velocity pattern on Doppler echocardiogram</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced right ventricular function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low peak Vo<sub>2</sub> with maximal exercise and exercise hemodynamics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markers of reduced tissue perfusion including low mean arterial pressure, decreased arterial pulse pressure, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> and an attenuated response to diuretics</p><p/><p>A lack of hemodynamic improvement with therapy, as indicated by failure to reduce left ventricular (LV) filling pressure and persistence of signs of congestion (orthopnea, jugular venous distension, edema, weight gain, or increased need for diuretics), is also associated with a poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In addition to these cardiac parameters, comorbid factors and the cause of the HF are important determinants of prognosis.

As an example, the improved outcome in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor is due primarily to better preservation of myocardial function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular ejection fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by a variable reduction in LVEF, the assessment of which is probably the most frequently performed cardiac function test in patients with HF. Clinically evident HF due to systolic dysfunction is generally not apparent until the LVEF falls below 35 to 40 percent, as determined by echocardiography or contrast or radionuclide angiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is, however, no predictable relationship between symptoms or exercise tolerance and the LVEF. Some patients are asymptomatic with an LVEF below 20 percent, while others are moribund with an LVEF above 30 percent.</p><p>In general, survival is shorter in patients with lower LVEFs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54758\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54758 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82195 \">figure 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. As an example, the relationship between LVEF and outcome was evaluated in 5010 patients enrolled in the Val-HeFT trial in whom echocardiograms were obtained at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Decreasing quartiles of LVEF were associated with increasing all-cause mortality at 23 months. Patients in the first quartile (mean LVEF 35 percent) had a significantly lower mortality rate than those in the fourth quartile (mean LVEF 17 percent) (14 versus 26 percent mortality, risk ratio 0.5). An LVEF below 20 percent is typically associated with poor survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]; some recommend cardiac transplantation in all such patients who are eligible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>However, relying on only a univariate predictor such as the LVEF to estimate survival is not very sensitive in the individual patient. As mentioned above, large trials have demonstrated that patients with NYHA class II or III HF have a worse prognosis than those who are asymptomatic. Despite the difference in outcome, the difference in mean LVEF between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in these trials was small: 28 to 31 percent in asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>] versus 25 percent in patients with moderate symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Concomitant diastolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concomitant diastolic dysfunction is associated with decreased survival among patients with HF and a reduced LVEF. Studies evaluating diastolic compliance with Doppler echocardiography have shown that a reduction in mitral flow velocity (as determined by a short deceleration time &le;115 msec, and an early-to-late flow velocity or <span class=\"nowrap\">E/A</span> ratio &gt;1) is a powerful independent predictor of mortality or the need for transplantation among patients with HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72146 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55685 \">figure 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].

At a mean follow-up of 26 months, patients with reversal of the restrictive pattern at six months had a lower cardiac mortality (11 versus 37 percent) and a lesser likelihood of being admitted to the hospital for worsening of HF (11 versus 54 percent) than those with persistence of the restrictive pattern.</p><p>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress on a restrictive pattern also appears to have prognostic value.

The patients with a persistent restrictive pattern had a significantly lower rate of survival at three years compared with those with a reversible restrictive pattern or those with a nonrestrictive pattern at rest (49 versus 79 and 89 percent, respectively).

Echocardiographic measurements of reduced right ventricular function include a reduction in right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), right ventricular enlargement, and tricuspid regurgitation.

The interaction is bidirectional as heart disease can affect renal function and renal disease can affect cardiac function. As an example, reduced renal function is associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure (HF), as will be discussed below. On the other hand, patients with chronic kidney disease have an increased risk of both atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure, and cardiovascular disease is responsible for up to 50 percent of deaths in patients with renal failure. In addition, acute or chronic dysfunction of the heart or kidneys can induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. The term cardiorenal syndrome has been applied to these interactions.

An elevated blood urea nitrogen (blood urea) is also associated with increased mortality, an effect that may be in part independent of the GFR.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HF often have one or more univariate predictors of decreased survival despite maximal medical therapy. Routine evaluation to estimate severity should include determination of New York Heart Association class; echocardiography to measure left ventricular ejection fraction, assess diastolic and right ventricular function, and identify other abnormalities such as regional wall motion abnormalities; and measurement of the plasma sodium and creatinine concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Major predictors of survival'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk models may provide a useful method for integrating several clinical variables to arrive at a more accurate estimate of prognosis. However, the predictive value of such models depends upon the clinical characteristics of the population that was studied and the list of variables that were considered for potential inclusion in the model. As a result, the prognosis for some patients may not be accurately reflected by these scores. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lucas C, Johnson W, Hamilton MA, et al.
