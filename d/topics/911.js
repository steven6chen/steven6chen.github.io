In the CT suite, radiation exposure poses an additional hazard. In the MRI suite, the anesthesiologist must manage unique hazards due to the strong magnetic field, radiofrequency energy, and loud acoustic noise, as well as use specialized MRI safe equipment for anesthetic delivery and monitoring.</p><p>This topic will review anesthetic management of adults and children undergoing MRI or CT procedures.

Setup typically includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transporting anesthetic monitors and equipment, as well as anesthetic agents and other drugs to a remote location. Potential clinical problems that might require special anesthetic equipment or specific pharmacologic agents must be anticipated. Due to the remote location, there is a high likelihood of a significant delay if additional items or assistance is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishing familiarity with equipment that differs from that typically used in the main operating room. In many institutions, new equipment (eg, monitor, anesthesia gas machine) is installed in the operating room first, and the older equipment is then rotated to off-site locations. Older equipment might not have the same features, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) filters or alarm management. In addition, MRI compatible monitors will be significantly different from typical operating room (OR) monitors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting up specially designed lengths or extensions of intravenous (IV) tubing, as well as long circuit tubing for the anesthesia machine circuit and the sampling catheter for monitoring respiratory gases (eg, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and expired inhaled anesthetic concentrations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is necessary because the distances between the patient and the anesthesia gas machine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infusion pumps for IV drugs may be 6 to 10 feet or sometimes more, depending on the layout of the imaging suite. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Configuring the room setup to allow the anesthesiologist to view both the patient and the anesthesia machine and monitors, either by direct observation or on a video monitor.

Pediatric patients who receive sedation or general anesthesia in these settings also have a high incidence of oxygen desaturation (2 to 12 percent), with such events occurring more commonly in those with developmental delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

Those receiving vasoactive infusions are at particularly high risk due to limited access to the patient and infusion pumps during MRI or CT scanning, as well as the absence of resuscitation equipment in the room that houses the MRI scanner. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2038774443\"><span class=\"h2\">Communication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Communication challenges and distractions include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Darkened room</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distance to the patient</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obstructed line of sight to the patient and monitors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loud acoustic noise generated during fast pulse MRI scanning, which may obscure alarms on monitors and other anesthesia equipment. Also, the hearing protectors worn by medical team members in the MRI suite impair communication.

For this reason, members of the care team (eg, radiologists, anesthesiologists, scanning equipment technicians, subspecialized nursing personnel) should discuss the sequence of events that will occur in a pre-procedure briefing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Issues include how and where anesthesia will be induced (eg, in the imaging room itself or in a separate induction room), how the patient will be transported to the imaging room and positioned, specific requirements for the imaging procedure (eg, periods of apnea for cardiac imaging), and where the patient will recover from anesthesia. Additional goals for the briefing include verification of availability and proper functioning of all necessary anesthetic and monitoring equipment.

(See <a href=\"#H290798455\" class=\"local\">'Emergency management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2445497158\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be delayed (defined as longer than two minutes after cardiac arrest). Delays occur due to the need for removal of the patient from the scanner, placement onto a stretcher, and relocation to a nearby environment fully stocked with resuscitation equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the MRI suite, the powerful magnet can draw heavy equipment such as a defibrillator into the bore of the scanner, so the patient must be moved to an area just outside of the suite. </p><p>Safety precautions that address these challenges include practiced multidisciplinary team responses to emergencies such as cardiac arrest and prearranged communication protocols to summon additional anesthesia personnel in an emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Ideally, the &quot;code team&quot; responders are experienced with specific anesthetic-related causes of respiratory or cardiac arrest in adult or pediatric patients, as appropriate.

Magnetic resonance imaging uses a strong magnetic field to orient atoms to the field's north-to-south poles, and then uses radiofrequency pulses to change the orientation of the nuclei of specific atoms. As the nuclei return to their ground state, they radiate radiofrequency energy, which is then analyzed to create the image. The strong magnetic field, radiofrequency pulses with associated electromagnetic interference (EMI), and loud acoustic noise are potentially hazardous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Practical aspects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1347213014\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic field</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strong static magnetic field may cause even heavy objects (eg, oxygen or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> tanks) to become accidental projectiles into the bore of the scanner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This magnetic field is constantly present, even when a patient is not being actively scanned. Thus, the anesthesia gas machine, monitors, intravenous (IV) infusion pumps, and all other anesthetic equipment must be MRI safe. The outermost line on the floor of an MRI suite is the 5 Gauss line. This is the point at which pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators, and other medical devices may be affected by the magnetic field. The field strength increases rapidly as one gets closer to the magnet. Stretchers, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and crash carts used for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) are <strong>not</strong> MRI compatible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3597185310\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> below.)</p><p>Some anesthesiologists will not be able to safely enter the MRI suite. For example, those with a pacemaker (PM), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or implanted insulin pump cannot provide anesthetic care in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Precautions'</a>.) </p><p>When possible, the anesthesiologist should remain at least 0.5 to 1 m from the bore of the scanner and should move slowly when it is necessary to be near the bore. Movement of a mannikin head faster than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/second</span> induced electric <span class=\"nowrap\">fields/current</span> densities above recommended levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rapid patient motion in the strong magnetic field near the MRI scanner produces an electrical current within the body, which may cause symptoms such as nausea, vertigo, headache, light flashes, loss of proprioception, or a metallic taste. The anesthesiologist may experience similar symptoms (typically dizziness or headaches) with rapid head movement in or near the magnet bore [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44343619\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiofrequency energy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiofrequency energy can cause tissue or device heating and can also induce current in conductors such as (ECG) leads, equipment cables, or fluid-filled tubing. Skin or other tissue burns can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], or in rare cases, a fire on the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Therefore, MRI compatible ECG leads are used, and equipment cables and IV tubing are not positioned directly on the patient's skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fire-safety-in-the-operating-room#H3052638527\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fire safety in the operating room&quot;, section on 'Fire on the patient'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23687543\"><span class=\"h3\">Electromagnetic interference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strong magnetic field and radiofrequency energy may cause artifacts that limit clinical interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) or pressure waveforms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</strong> &ndash; The magnetic field can produce artifactual changes in the ECG waveform. In order to eliminate the use of long conductors, MR-safe monitors use either wireless transmitters or fiberoptic cables for the ECG and pulse oximeter, with communication to a central monitoring station that sends the waveforms to a remote display unit. However, such wireless ECG waveforms may be affected by interference from several sources. For example, when the patient's upper body is in the scanner, the ECG is subject to interference from a phenomenon called hydromagnetics, whereby the strong magnetic field produces a current in blood flowing through the ascending aorta and aortic arch, which results in artifactual alterations of the ST segment of the ECG. Although most MRI safe monitors incorporate one or more preprogrammed filters to improve the waveform, residual artifacts may persist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Also, during periods of pulsating radiofrequency energy, the magnetic field may generate electromagnetic interference (EMI) that affects the entire waveform of the ECG. Thus, clinical interpretation of the ECG may be difficult while the patient is in the scanner, despite availability of ECG leads that are shielded to mitigate this effect as much as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pressure waveforms</strong> &ndash; Other standard monitor features such as waveform filters that are typically helpful for optimizing arterial or other pressure waveform analysis may be absent or inadequate in MRI <span class=\"nowrap\">safe/compatible</span> monitor models.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1851145763\"><span class=\"h3\">Loud acoustic noise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loud acoustic noise is generated during the pulses of energy required for imaging because the gradient coils vibrate loudly in the strong magnetic field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82585 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although a sound level of 40 decibels (dB) is generally an acceptable limit in an operating room, an MRI scanner can generate noise levels as high as 125 dB (approximately as loud as a chainsaw) during fast pulsed imaging sequences, especially with stronger static fields.</p><p>Since this noise may cause hearing damage, earplugs should be inserted into the patient's ears. Medical personnel can also experience hearing loss due to the loud acoustic noise. Hearing protectors should be worn by the anesthesiologist to attenuate the noise level by up to 10 to 60 dB, although this may obscure alarms on monitoring and other equipment, as well as cause communication difficulties with other medical personnel in the MRI suite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200910916\"><span class=\"h3\">Emergency quench</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rare occurrence is an unexpected magnet quench (defined as loss of magnet superconductivity with sudden boil-off of cryogenic [-269&deg;C] liquid helium), or a controlled quench performed to remove the patient from the bore [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The magnet is only quenched in the event of a truly life-threatening emergency such as a patient or staff member being pinned against the magnet by a ferromagnetic object. (In most cases, if a magnetic object is stuck to the scanner but nobody is in danger, the magnet is ramped down slowly without being quenched and the piece of equipment is removed.) In the event of a quench, the quench duct should vent atop the building in which the MRI is installed. If not properly vented, a quench can result in complete dissipation of oxygen inside the MRI suite, risking hypoxia to the patient and to MRI personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although the patient and all staff are evacuated from the scanner room as quickly as possible during a quench, entrance or exit from the suite may not be possible for several seconds due to high pressure against the doors generated by escaping gases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2753462580\"><span class=\"h2\">Preanesthesia consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radiology team may consult anesthesia personnel to determine what type of anesthetic care is necessary in selected patients with severe anxiety or claustrophobia, inability to lie supine, inability to cooperate, morbid obesity, a difficult airway, obtunded or comatose state after craniotomy, or hemodynamic instability. The preanesthesia consultation for patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) involves reviewing the pathology for which the procedure is being performed and understanding the specific requirements for completion of the scan that may affect anesthetic care, as determined by the interventionalist or radiology team (eg, a need for frequent periods of apnea). (See <a href=\"#H3398610242\" class=\"local\">'Sedation and anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p>It is particularly important to identify factors that may cause patient injury or complications due to the MRI scanning equipment or administration of contrast agent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MRI safety</strong> &ndash; Most permanent PMs and ICDs are not MRI-conditional. Even with MRI-conditional PMs and ICDs, device-specific precautions during MRI are not uniform and should be checked with the manufacturer. For patients with PMs and ICDs that are not MRI-conditional, if an MRI examination is indicated and necessary, scanning can be undertaken at a center with equipment and experience in performing such examinations if specific precautionary measures are in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>].

Thus, MRI safe equipment (eg, ECG leads, pulse oximeter probes, blood pressure cuffs and cables) should be used. Also, wires, equipment cables, and oxygen or intravenous tubing are padded and placement directly on the patient's skin is avoided.

Thus, positioning of the anesthesia machine, monitors, and other equipment within the MRI suite is carefully planned before, during, and after an imaging study. Collaboration with the MRI technologist is necessary to determine and demarcate the optimal and safe locations for movable anesthesia equipment in relation to the magnet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-magnetic-resonance-imaging-and-computed-tomography-procedures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The patient's position in the scanner depends upon the specific imaging requirements. During brain imaging the patient is usually positioned with his head in the scanner and arms tucked at the sides,<strong> </strong>although positioning will vary for the specific scanning purposes. For example, lower extremity scans can be done with only the extremity in the scanner; for breast imaging, the patient is typically prone, with arms over the head. Consideration should be given to nerve injuries (ie, stretch of brachial plexus) that may occur in certain positions, particularly for patients under general anesthesia. Typically, the anesthesiologist monitors the patient from a control room. If possible, configuration of the MRI suite setup allows the anesthesiologist to maintain an unobstructed view of the patient, anesthesia machine, and monitors, either by direct observation or on a video monitor.
