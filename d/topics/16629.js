The mechanical obstruction leads to increases in pressure within the left atrium, pulmonary vasculature, and right side of the heart. Progressive MS leads to complications including heart failure, systemic arterial embolism, hemoptysis, pulmonary hypertension, and death. Medical therapy can alleviate symptoms, but surgical or percutaneous intervention is required to relieve the obstruction to flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management and indications for intervention for mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical and investigational approaches to management of MS are reviewed here. Issues directly related to the indications for intervention and choice of percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy versus surgery and the medical management of MS are discussed separately.

Echocardiography (initial transthoracic, complemented by transesophageal if needed) is used primarily for the hemodynamic (functional) assessment of valve pathology while MDCT is essential for precise preoperative anatomical delineation of MV apparatus anatomy and pathology including delineation of whether calcium is limited to the leaflet, involves the subvalvular apparatus, or even extends into the left ventricle beyond the mitral annulus. </p><p>Transthoracic echocardiography is the initial test of choice for assessment of MV pathology and hemodynamic (functional) severity of disease. In selected cases in which transthoracic echocardiographic assessment is incomplete, transesophageal echocardiography is useful for further characterization of pathology including the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/extent</span> of calcification and assessment of mitral regurgitation. When available, MDCT is used for precise anatomical delineation of <span class=\"nowrap\">abnormalities/pathology</span> of the MV apparatus.</p><p>The feasibility of percutaneous or surgical commissurotomy is assessed based upon the type and severity of pathologic change involving the valve and subvalvular apparatus. For percutaneous commissurotomy, this is most commonly assessed using the Wilkins score, as discussed separately. Assessment for open MV surgery includes more extensive evaluation of all rheumatic pathology including the leaflets (to determine need for surgical delamination and augmentation with pericardium ), commissures, and <span class=\"nowrap\">subchordal/chordal</span> (elongation, splitting, chordal transfer or insertion) and papillary muscle pathologies.

Infrequent causes of MS include mitral annular calcification (MAC) and congenital MS (including parachute MV). The differing features of these causes enable differentiation by echocardiography.

As shown in the prospective REMEDY study of the global characteristics of rheumatic valvular disease, there is a gradient of availability of interventional procedures among the low, middle income, or upper middle income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatic MS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When intervention is warranted in patients with rheumatic MS with valve morphology favorable for percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV; ie, limited calcium and valve thickening, pliable leaflets, and limited subvalvular thickening), no left atrial thrombus, and without moderate to severe (3+ to 4+) mitral regurgitation, we recommend PMBV, as recommended in the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98324 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98396\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98396 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In patients with MS caused by MAC, PMBV (which treats commissural fusion in patients with rheumatic valve disease) is not effective. However, the presence of severe MAC complicates MV surgery and is associated with high operative mortality rates.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Rheumatic MS'</a> above.)</p><p>Open commissurotomy is performed via a median sternotomy and has the advantage of allowing the surgeon to inspect the MV and subvalvular apparatus. In addition to splitting the commissures under direct vision, the valve can be repaired by debriding calcium deposits and abnormal cusp tissue followed by replacement with autologous pericardium and artificial chordae, dividing fused chordae tendineae, and splitting papillary muscles when appropriate. When mitral regurgitation is present, an annuloplasty ring is placed to restore valve competency. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546799078\"><span class=\"h4\">Use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PMBV is generally preferred to open commissurotomy since outcomes with PMBV were similar or better than those with open commissurotomy in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Other advantages of PMBV are shorter hospital stay, avoidance of the morbidity of thoracotomy, and a better outcome if repeat intervention is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2488728766\" class=\"local\">'Repeat commissurotomy'</a> below). However, open commissurotomy with valve repair remains an appropriate choice in patients who are not candidates for PMBV due to valve deformity or calcification, left atrial thrombus, or significant mitral regurgitation. Similar to closed commissurotomy and balloon valvotomy, the success of the procedure depends upon a favorable valve morphology (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above). In addition, thrombectomy can be performed to remove a left atrial thrombus, and many surgeons amputate or ligate the left atrial appendage to remove a potential source of embolism. (See <a href=\"#H16131432\" class=\"local\">'Left atrial appendage ligation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1743456154\"><span class=\"h4\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety and efficacy of open commissurotomy are well established. Successful commissurotomy is generally defined as MV area &gt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> (normal 4 to 6 cm<sup>2</sup>) and a decrease in left atrial pressure to &le;18 mmHg in the absence of complications; the most common complication is mitral regurgitation, which occurs in 2 to 10 percent of patients.</p><p>Results from several studies have shown no residual stenosis with open commissurotomy; perioperative mortality rates are less than 1 percent and, at five to seven years, only 7 percent of patients need a reintervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/5,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8</a>]. The absence of residual stenosis means the acute success rate is essentially 100 percent in candidates with suitable valve morphology. Observational data show lower cardiac mortality rates with mitral repair compared with MV replacement, although cardiac mortality rates are similar after adjustment for baseline differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This operation is performed on a beating heart, which is generally exposed via a left thoracotomy incision. The surgeon then uses either a transatrial or transventricular approach to introduce a dilator across the MV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Thus, for women who are expected to have a future pregnancy, the benefit of avoiding the risks of anticoagulation for a mechanical valve is weighed against the risk of reoperation if a bioprosthetic valve is placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-valve-disease#H10779088\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and valve disease&quot;, section on 'Interventions prior to pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with MS who require valve replacement and are not expected to have future pregnancies (men and selected women), a mechanical prosthesis is commonly chosen because the patients are usually relatively young (&lt;65 to 70 years old), and most require chronic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (the lack of requirement for anticoagulation being a relative advantage of bioprosthetic valves). Choice of MV prosthesis is discussed further separately.

The perioperative mortality varies with the patient population, ranging from less than 5 percent in young healthy individuals to approximately 10 to 20 percent in older patients with significant comorbidities and pulmonary hypertension to 25 percent in patients with NYHA class IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98396\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98396 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>].</p><p>The last observation indicates the risk of delaying surgery. On the other hand, early MV replacement exposes the patient to a longer period of the persistent risks of valve thrombosis, systemic embolism, endocarditis, and bleeding secondary to chronic anticoagulant therapy. The risk of one of these complications is estimated to be 4 to 7 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Accordingly, to reduce the risk of PPM, surgeons implant the largest possible valve prosthesis. If the valve annulus is small, a mechanical prosthesis is favored when appropriate given its higher effective office area, lower transvalvular gradients, and lower risk of strut-related left ventricular outflow obstruction compared with a bioprosthesis. </p><p>Some degree of PPM is common among patients undergoing MV replacement. The effective orifice area (EOA) in prosthetic valves used for MV replacement is often small in relation to body size and may be associated with transvalvular pressure gradients similar to those in mild to moderate MS. </p><p>The possible detrimental impact of PPM on long-term survival was evaluated in a retrospective study of 929 patients undergoing MV replacement for both regurgitation and stenosis; the patients were followed for a mean of 6.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Long-term outcomes of this technique are lacking, and potential risks of conduit-related complications including thrombosis and degeneration require study.</p><p>MV bypass was first reported in patients with congenital MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. This technique has been applied to patients with MS due to severe MAC who are at high risk for conventional MV replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. MV bypass avoids direct manipulation of the severely calcified mitral annulus and involves sewing a conduit from the left atrium (typically the left atrial appendage or left atriotomy incision site) to the left ventricular apex. A prosthetic valve (either bioprosthetic or mechanical) is incorporated in the conduit near the left ventricle. Importantly, this technique cannot be used in patients with significant mitral regurgitation as the conduit only treats MS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1584420640\"><span class=\"h3\">Transcatheter mitral valve replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transcatheter MV replacement is under investigation as a means of treating patients with severe MS who cannot be treated by PMBV and who have prohibitive surgical risk. There is a clear need for minimally invasive MV replacement strategies given the increasing prevalence of advanced age and comorbidities in patients with symptomatic MS, particularly in the population with severe MS due to MAC. In patients with radiation-associated heart disease, extensive calcification of the ascending aorta often makes the risk of surgery prohibitive, leaving limited treatment options. </p><p>Transcatheter MV replacement involves insertion of a balloon-expandable or self-expanding transcatheter valve into the MV position while leaving the native MV tissue in place. This can be accomplished via transapical access, surgical transatrial exposure, or via a completely percutaneous transvenous transseptal approach.</p><p>Early investigations of balloon-expandable transcatheter valve implantation in patients with severe circumferential MAC have highlighted the challenges associated with implanting transcatheter valves into the complex MV anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
