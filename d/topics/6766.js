Joint and soft tissue structures that are common sources of pain include the epicondyles (medial and lateral), the olecranon bursa, and the radial and ulnar nerves, which course near the elbow joint. Referred pain most commonly arises from a cervical radiculopathy or from the shoulder.</p><p>This topic will discuss how to systematically approach the adult patient with nontraumatic elbow pain, and identify the most common causes for such pain. Discussions of specific problems affecting the elbow are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The elbow joint is formed by the articulation of the distal end of the humerus with the proximal radius (radial head) and ulna (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81300\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81300 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68107 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874 \">figure 4</a>). <span class=\"nowrap\">Flexion/extension</span> occurs at the ulnohumeral joint and is powered by the biceps and triceps muscles, respectively. The normal arc of motion ranges from full extension (0 degrees) to full flexion (135 degrees). Some individuals demonstrate the ability to extend the elbow beyond normal; this condition is referred to as &quot;cubitus recurvatus&quot; or cubital recurvatum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62841 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Supination/pronation</span> (rotation) occurs at the radiohumeral and proximal radioulnar articulations of the elbow joint. The biceps muscle supinates and the pronator teres muscle pronates the elbow. The elbow can rotate from 0 to 180 degrees.</p><p>The epicondyles are bony prominences easily palpated on the medial and lateral sides of the distal humerus, proximal to the elbow joint, and they are a common source of pain. The tendinous origin of the muscles that flex and extend the wrist and fingers are located at the medial and lateral epicondyle, respectively.</p><p>Multiple bursae have been identified around the elbow joint; the olecranon bursa is the most superficial, and swelling of this bursa is both common and easily observed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64359\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64359 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>A number of ligaments support the elbow joint; clinically important is the ulnar collateral or medial ligamentous group that assists in providing valgus stability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97474 \">figure 5</a>). The anterior bundle or band runs from the medial humeral condyle to the coronoid process of the ulna and provides the principal resistance to valgus instability.</p><p>The ulnar nerve courses through the elbow joint in the ulnar groove posterior and medial to the elbow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81300\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81300 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68935 \">figure 6</a>). Its course is contiguous with the joint capsule; thus, any process that distends the joint tends to impinge upon the ulnar nerve, causing paresthesias in the ulnar aspect of the hand and occasional weakness in the flexor digiti quinti. The median nerve runs anterior to the joint capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 3</a>); entrapment in this region typically is due to elbow trauma, repetitive elbow flexion, or supination and pronation of the forearm. The radial nerve passes posterior to the humerus, and then ascends anteriorly over the lateral epicondyle before dividing into superficial and deep branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND COMMON PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the common causes of elbow pain are periarticular, including epicondylitis, olecranon bursitis, nerve entrapment syndromes, and referred pain. Systemic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) usually have polyarticular involvement that is revealed by a careful musculoskeletal history and examination. However, oligoarticular involvement can occur, as in the seronegative spondyloarthritides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are experiencing a problem unique or intrinsic to the elbow typically present with complaints of pain (eg, epicondylitis), swelling (eg, olecranon bursitis), or a loss of motion (eg, joint injury). Each of the more common presentation patterns is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lateral elbow pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lateral elbow pain is the most common complaint at the elbow. The source of pain may be the lateral epicondyle, the radiohumeral joint, or referred pain from the shoulder or neck. A more complete list of the causes of lateral elbow pain is found in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73460\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73460 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain of lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is typically well localized (the patient often points to the lateral epicondylar process) and is aggravated by activity that contracts the wrist extensors, including repetitious use of the forearm and wrist, and shaking hands. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain arising from the elbow (radiohumeral) joint is located slightly more posterior to the epicondyle (between the epicondyle and the olecranon process), is not well localized, and is readily distinguished from the pain of lateral epicondylitis by its effect upon joint (it is exceedingly rare for lateral epicondylitis to affect elbow range of motion). A joint effusion reduces elbow extension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain referred to the lateral elbow is suggested by the absence of increased pain with palpation or elbow movement, a vague description, and aggravation of the pain with movement of the shoulder or neck.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Medial elbow pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medial elbow pain is the second most common complaint at the elbow. It frequently arises either from the medial epicondyle or the ulnar nerve as it travels through the cubital tunnel. A more complete list of the causes of medial elbow pain is found in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52503 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with lateral epicondylitis, the pain of medial epicondylitis is well localized and is aggravated by actions that contract the wrist flexors, such as lifting or repetitious use of the forearm and wrist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain arising from the ulnar nerve is suggested by radiation into the ulnar side of the hand and associated sensory (or occasionally motor) symptoms in the fourth and fifth fingers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Elbow swelling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who complain of elbow swelling most often have olecranon bursitis, however, other more serious conditions may occur. The warmth and redness that accompany the swelling, and the rapidity with which symptoms and signs develop, are clues to distinguish among potential underlying causes (usually trauma, sepsis, or gout). The ability of the patient to extend and flex the elbow completely generally excludes an intra-articular process as the cause of the elbow pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an intraarticular process occasionally complain of elbow swelling as well as elbow pain. However, these symptoms are virtually always overshadowed by their universal complaint, &quot;I cannot straighten my elbow.&quot; Causes of synovitis include rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathies, such as reactive arthritis, psoriasis, or inflammatory bowel disease, crystal-induced synovitis due to gout or pseudogout, and septic bacterial arthritis.</p><p>Loss of smooth elbow motion without signs of inflammation occurs almost exclusively in athletes, particularly throwers (eg, baseball players) and gymnasts, who cause trauma to the joint by throwing, vaulting, and floor exercises. This presentation suggests the presence of osteonecrosis (osteochondritis dissecans) of the humerus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteochondritis-dissecans-ocd-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Referred pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical radiculopathy and shoulder pathology, particularly rotator cuff tendinopathy, may refer pain to or &quot;through&quot; the elbow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such pain is typically a deep ache that is not affected by elbow motion. These diagnoses are suggested by the associated symptoms (paresthesias or hypesthesias), the absence of local tenderness and swelling, and aggravation of the symptoms by shoulder or neck movement.</p><p>As an example, lateral herniation between C6-7 produces pain at the shoulder blade, pectoral area, and medial axilla with radiation to posterolateral upper arm, dorsal elbow and forearm, index and medial digits or all of the fingers, and sensory impairment in these areas. There is also weakness in extension of the forearm and sometimes the wrist and diminished or absent triceps reflex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with neck pain and cervical spine disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595517803\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful history should be performed prior to the examination. The history should seek to identify an acute versus a chronic complaint, and detail a mechanism of injury (eg, traumatic or secondary to overuse) if one occurred. The onset of the injury and a history of prior interventions (eg, surgeries and injections) may offer important insights into etiology. </p><p>Critical to the diagnosis is an assessment of any functional impairment compared to baseline, including any sport-related or occupational dysfunction, and any limitations on activities of daily living. The history should include arm dominance, and conditions and interventions affecting the entire kinetic chain, particularly proximal structures (eg, shoulder and neck).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efficient examination of the elbow involves a systematic approach, including inspection, palpation, range of motion assessment, motor and sensory evaluation, special tests, and examination of related areas. The elbow, remainder of the affected upper extremity, and cervical spine should be examined. Key diagnostic findings are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79000\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79000 \">table 3</a>): </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2881966552\"><span class=\"h2\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination of the elbow begins with systematic inspection. Look for joint swelling, discoloration, atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114867\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114867 \">picture 3</a>), hypopigmentation, and asymmetry. The carrying angle (humerus to ulna; normal is 5 to 15 degrees) should be noted, paying close attention to any angular deformities and asymmetries. </p><p>Inspect the olecranon bursa for swelling and thickening. If the bursa is noted to be enlarged, flex the elbow to 90 degrees and palpate for ballotable cystic swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58894 \">picture 4</a>). An acutely swollen and red bursa suggests the diagnosis of acute bursitis, while a swollen and thickened bursa is consistent with a flare of chronic bursitis, and a thickened bursa alone suggests chronic bursitis. Fluid should be aspirated to determine the underlying cause of swelling if there is associated pain, local inflammation, or if the patient is febrile.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2856366519\"><span class=\"h2\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpate the radiohumeral joint to determine the presence of an effusion or focal tenderness. The lateral and medial epicondyles are palpated for tenderness with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64356\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64356 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55147\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55147 \">picture 6</a>). Local tenderness is the hallmark feature of lateral and medial epicondylitis, respectively. Patients with pain in one of these areas should go on to have confirmatory testing as outlined below.</p><p>While not directly palpable, the general locations of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments are palpated for tenderness in patients, particularly throwing athletes, suspected of ligamentous injury. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Ligamentous injury'</a> below.) </p><p>The insertion of the triceps tendon and olecranon are palpated for tenderness, particularly in patients with posterior elbow pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elbow motion should be assessed; normal values are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F70587\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70587 \">table 4</a>). Elbow flexion, extension, pronation, and supination should be tested.</p><p>Passive range of motion testing of the ulnohumeral joint assesses the integrity of the elbow in flexion and extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54946\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54946 \">picture 7</a>). Full arm extension and flexion are compared side to side.</p><p>Full elbow extension dramatically reduces the intraarticular volume of the joint. With an inflammatory synovitis, the elbow joint assumes a position of flexion in order to increase the joint volume, thereby reducing the intraarticular pressure and associated pain felt within the elbow. Thus, full elbow extension will cause pain with an elbow synovitis, but not with olecranon bursitis.</p><p>Loss of full extension with end-point stiffness suggests the presence of a small effusion with mild arthritis. Loss of full extension AND flexion suggests the presence of a large effusion with moderate to severe arthritis. A joint effusion related to either an inflammatory arthritis or hemarthrosis can be readily excluded by documenting normal range of motion.</p><p>Osteoarthritis of the elbow is uncommon, unless there is a history of elbow fracture. A fracture involving the elbow is uncommon in patients who are able to perform full elbow extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Passive range of motion of the radiohumeral joint assesses the integrity of the elbow in supination and pronation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51261\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51261 \">picture 8</a>). Passive supination and pronation are compared side to side while palpating the radial head.</p><p>Loss of full supination or pronation suggests previous fracture or dislocation of the elbow or osteonecrosis. Loss of full supination also occurs with congenital dislocation of the radial head. Pronation and supination are painful and limited in patients with synovitis; this may help to distinguish patients with a joint effusion from those with bursal swelling, as olecranon bursitis is associated with normal joint motion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2132582830\"><span class=\"h2\">Elbow instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The elbow is tested for laxity with the joint in both 0 and 30 degrees of flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is done by placing one hand behind the elbow with the thumb and middle finger over the location of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (just distal to the epicondyles), while the other hand holds the patient's wrist and exerts a valgus and varus stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The degree of joint laxity is compared with the unaffected elbow. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698737146\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor and sensory examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motor function is evaluated by assessing active motion and strength, including resisted elbow flexion, extension, pronation, and supination. Note any asymmetry or pain. The median (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99716 \">figure 7</a>), ulnar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75124 \">figure 8</a>), and radial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99718 \">figure 9</a>) nerves all cross the elbow joint and their sensation should be assessed; this examination is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832630930\"><span class=\"h2\">Special tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H813383035\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tennis elbow test is performed with the patient's extended elbow stabilized in the physician's hand and the thumb of that hand positioned on the patient's lateral epicondyle. The patient makes a fist, pronates the forearm and radially deviates and extends the wrist while the physician applies a resisting force at the fist. The test is positive if pain is elicited in the area of the lateral epicondyle. In the patient with more advanced tennis elbow, pain is elicited when the same maneuver is performed with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees. </p><p>The <strong>&quot;book test&quot;</strong> may be used to help diagnose tennis elbow. It is performed by having the patient hold a book with the affected arm in full extension and pronation (palm down). A positive test is marked by pain at the lateral epicondyle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4003061730\"><span class=\"h3\">Medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow) test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The golfer's elbow test is performed similarly to the tennis elbow. In this case, however, pain is present from the tip of the medial epicondyle to the pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis muscles. Pain is increased with wrist flexion and forearm supination performed against resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1326713087\"><span class=\"h3\">Radial tunnel syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of radial tunnel syndrome, involving entrapment of the radial nerve as it enters the supinator muscle, should be considered in patients initially diagnosed with tennis elbow who fail to improve with conservative therapy. Flexion force applied against long finger (third digit) extension distal to the proximal interphalangeal joint may provoke pain over the extensor muscle mass in the proximal forearm. This finding is suggestive of radial tunnel syndrome, which is often misdiagnosed as resistant lateral tennis elbow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198469\"><span class=\"h3\">Tinels sign</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with suspected ulnar nerve entrapment, tapping a finger over the ulnar groove or cubital tunnel may reproduce the patient&rsquo;s symptoms (positive Tinels sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53954\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53954 \">picture 9</a>). A positive sign elicited at the medial elbow usually consists of lancinating pain or numbness felt in the fourth (ring) and fifth (little) fingers; the response should be distinctly different from the opposite side. Abnormal responses can be confirmed with nerve conduction velocity testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3948252721\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination of related areas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neck, shoulder and wrist should be examined carefully in the patient with elbow pain. This examination excludes elbow symptoms secondary to referred pain or resulting from compensation for dysfunction or injury at remote locations (eg, tennis elbow secondary to rotator cuff dysfunction). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with neck pain and cervical spine disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination pearls</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal range of motion testing of the elbow effectively rules out involvement of the elbow joint itself. This is particularly important when it is not clear if the source of swelling is bursal or intraarticular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epicondylitis and olecranon bursitis rarely affect elbow range of motion. The only exceptions to this rule are cellulitis accompanying a septic olecranon bursitis or chronic lateral epicondylitis in the patient with an extremely low pain threshold. Any loss of full extension or flexion reflects involvement of the elbow joint.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Epicondylitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epicondylitis (medial or lateral) has numerous etiologies including repetitive wrist turning or hand gripping, tool use, shaking hands, or twisting movements that may exceed tissue capacity. It is an occupational hazard in carpenters, gardeners, dentists, and politicians. Tennis players, particularly novices with a one-handed backhand, often suffer lateral epicondylitis as a result of pressure grip strain, or due to backhand shots performed with a &quot;leading elbow&quot; in which the elbow is pointed to the net during racquet impact with the ball. Medial epicondylitis has been referred to as &quot;golfer's elbow.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lateral epicondylitis is typically caused by <span class=\"nowrap\">microtearing/microavulsion</span> of the extensor carpi radialis brevis and longus tendons.

Traumatic bursitis accounts for most cases. Common traumatic etiologies include leaning on the elbow or using the elbow to arise from bed or as part of an occupation such as laying carpet. The onset is seldom acute when trauma is the inciting cause, and the surrounding tissues are usually normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infection of the bursa usually follows an abrasion or occurs in association with an initial cellulitis. Involvement of the olecranon bursa may be the initial presentation of gout, but it most commonly occurs with recurrent episodes of gouty arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of acute olecranon bursitis is readily made by noting the characteristic swelling over the posterior olecranon process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64359\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64359 \">picture 2</a>). As this swelling does not involve the joint, it does not prevent the patient from fully extending the elbow, a movement that will reduce the pain. However, bursal aspiration and laboratory analysis are necessary to distinguish the three common causes of bursal swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289310823\"><span class=\"h2\">Triceps tendinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The triceps muscle is the primary extensor of the elbow. While uncommon, tendinopathy of the triceps insertion is occasionally seen in weight lifters or laborers whose work involves repetitive elbow extension against resistance.<sup> </sup>Diagnosis is generally straightforward in the setting of a suggestive history and examination findings. On examination, patients report pain at the posterior elbow with resisted elbow extension, and tenderness at the triceps insertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve entrapment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ulnar, radial, and median nerves course in close proximity to the elbow. Any disease process affecting the elbow can involve these nerves or their branches and cause sensory or motor symptoms in the hand. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ulnar neuropathy is the most common compression neuropathy affecting the elbow. In mild cases, symptoms include sensory loss and paresthesias over the ring and small fingers. In more severe cases, weakness of the interossei becomes apparent, and the patient may complain of a weakened grip and clumsiness with the hand.</p><p>Elbow joint inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis rarely causes an entrapment neuropathy of either the anterior interosseous nerve, a pure motor branch of the median nerve, or the posterior interosseous nerve, a pure motor branch of the radial nerve. In the anterior interosseous syndrome, there is motor dysfunction of the flexor pollicis longus and of the flexor digitorum profundus of the index and middle fingers; there is no sensory loss in the hand, but a paresthetic pain may be felt in the elbow and over the proximal volar aspect of the forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The posterior interosseous nerve syndrome is associated with a deep-seated pain within the elbow and weakness upon extension of the third, fourth, and fifth digits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Thus, degenerative processes are exceptionally rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. When present, osteoarthritis is usually related to prior intraarticular fractures, avulsion injuries to the humeral condyles (&quot;Little League&quot; elbow), or previous episodes of osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nevertheless, the presence of an elbow deformity generally should be interpreted as strong evidence for an underlying inflammatory arthritis.

Great force is generated during the late cocking and early acceleration phases of throwing (eg, pitching a baseball or serving a tennis ball), which results in valgus stress on the elbow, born primarily by the ulnar collateral ligament. Repetitive throwing can create cumulative microtrauma to this ligament resulting in medial elbow pain and possibly ligamentous laxity. Throwing-related elbow injuries, including ulnar collateral ligament strain, common flexor tendon sprain, and valgus extension overload, are discussed separately.

Its major function is to supinate the forearm but it also serves as a secondary elbow flexor. Injury to the tendon can occur from either forceful lifting or supination and causes sudden pain. The pain, which is felt deep in the antecubital fossa, is often vaguely described in quality and location. Swelling and ecchymosis is often present in the antecubital fossa. The diagnosis is suggested by the history and by the presence of tenderness over the radial tubercle, deep in the antecubital fossa, and pain that is aggravated by resisting flexion and supination of the forearm. The presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of distal biceps tendon rupture is discussed in greater detail separately.

Examination may reveal an abnormal valgus carrying angle of the elbow and a loss of full supination. These individuals may have congenital dislocation of the radial head, which can be assessed with standard radiographs. This is the most common congenital condition of the elbow and often remains asymptomatic for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4212118990\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3626630161\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographs of the elbow are rarely necessary in patients with nontraumatic elbow pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61667%7EEM%2F60057\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61667 graphicRef60057 \">image 1A-B</a>). However, patients with a significant loss of elbow motion or function, or who have sustained significant trauma to the elbow, generally warrant imaging with plain radiographs. Osteoarthritis of the elbow is uncommon outside of the setting of previous trauma or underlying congenital bony abnormalities.
