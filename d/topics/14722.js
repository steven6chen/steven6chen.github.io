More important, doctors sometimes offer surgery or a procedure to people who might benefit from them but who could instead be treated in other ways. Some related questions that are also worth asking are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Are there options besides surgery or a procedure?</strong> &ndash; In some cases, surgery or a procedure is 1 of several treatment options. If you have a choice of treatments, and surgery or a procedure is just 1 option, you will have to decide &ndash; with input from your doctor &ndash; what to do. People decide whether to have surgery or a procedure based on:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How much their problem bothers them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How likely the surgery or procedure is to help</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How worried they are about the risks involved</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether they have someone at home who can help take care of them afterwards</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How long the recovery period might be</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether the surgery or procedure will relieve pain they currently have</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How much pain the surgery or procedure might cause</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether they would have to miss work</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What if I don't have surgery or a procedure?</strong> &ndash; Lots of different conditions can be treated with procedures or surgery. Some of these conditions get worse without treatment, some get better, and some stay the same. If the surgery or procedure is not absolutely necessary and your symptoms don't bother you too much, you might decide to try other treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Are there different kinds of surgery or procedures that accomplish the same goal?</strong> &ndash; Sometimes a condition can be treated in more than 1 way. Ask your doctor what options you have and what the differences between them are. Below are examples of some of the main surgery and procedure options.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Open surgery &ndash; For open surgery, the surgeon makes a cut big enough so that he or she can work directly on the parts inside your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minimally invasive surgery &ndash; For minimally invasive surgery, the surgeon makes smaller cuts and uses special tools that go inside your body. The tools can be controlled from the outside with the help of a camera.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Percutaneous procedures &ndash; For percutaneous procedures, the surgeon or another doctor called an &quot;interventionalist&quot; gets access to a part of the body through the skin. He or she inserts a special tool and pushes it to the area with the problem. One type of percutaneous procedure is called &quot;endovascular surgery.&quot; For this, the doctor goes in through a blood vessel in the leg or arm to access another part of the blood vessel, or the heart. Special tools and devices can then be pushed through the blood vessel to the area with the problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endoscopic procedures &ndash; For endoscopic procedures, the doctor uses a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end. The tube goes into 1 of the natural openings in the body, such as the mouth, urethra (where urine comes out), or vagina. These procedures are used to look at or treat conditions of the stomach or intestines (&quot;gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;), bladder (&quot;cystoscopy&quot;), or uterus (&quot;hysteroscopy&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428807\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits and risks of surgery or a procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every surgery or procedure, no matter how &quot;minor,&quot; carries risks. Make sure you understand the risks and benefits of the surgery or procedure you might have.</p><p>Here are some related questions to ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the chances that I will benefit and how long is the benefit likely to last?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the most common risks, and how long do their effects last?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the most serious risks, even if they are not very common?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428822\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want a second opinion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Do not be afraid to ask for a second opinion. No doctor should ever be worried or bothered if you want a second opinion. In fact, your doctor should be willing to help you find the best surgeon or interventionalist to suit your needs.</p><p>You can also get the names of other doctors who perform the surgery or procedure from your primary care doctor or from people you know who have had a similar surgery or procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428837\"><span class=\"h1\">What type of anesthesia will I need and what risks does it have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the risks of surgery or procedures come from the type of anesthesia that is used. Even &quot;minor&quot; surgeries or procedures have risks related to anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428852\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my recovery be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People do not always know what to expect in the recovery period after surgery or a procedure. It's very important to find out &ndash; ahead of time &ndash; the answers to these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much pain can I expect in the days and weeks afterward?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How will my pain be treated or managed?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long will I be in the hospital?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will I need help when I return home?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will I need to have someone drive me home?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After surgery or the procedure, will I be able to do all the things I normally do? If not, how long will I be unable to do these things?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When will I be able to return to work?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428867\"><span class=\"h1\">How much experience does my surgeon or interventionalist have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your surgeon or interventionalist, &quot;How many of these surgeries or procedures have you done in the last year?&quot; Find out, too, if the hospital where you will be has a lot of experience handling people having the kind of surgery or procedure you need.</p><p>Before you have your surgery or procedure, ask if there are treatment centers that specialize in the type of surgery or procedure you need. You might decide to get treated at a specialty center, or you might not. But knowing how your options compare will help you make the decision that's right for you.</p><p>For some types of surgeries or procedures, it's best to go to a place that specializes in the type of surgery or procedure you need. For example, weight loss surgery is best done at a &quot;center of excellence&quot; that is dedicated to this type of surgery. That's because people having weight loss surgery often need to be seen by a lot of different healthcare providers with a special interest in obesity. Plus, people who need weight loss surgery often have special needs because of their size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428884\"><span class=\"h1\">How much will surgery or the procedure cost?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even with insurance coverage, people often have to pay some costs themselves when they have surgery or a procedure. It's a good idea to find out ahead of time what you might have to pay. For that information, call your insurance company directly. When you speak with them, ask if they have to &quot;pre-approve&quot; your surgery or procedure. If cost is a concern for you, ask your insurance provider and your doctor whether there are less expensive treatment options that could help you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428899\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minimally-invasive-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Minimally invasive surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anesthesia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Endovascular surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-after-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain after surgery (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
