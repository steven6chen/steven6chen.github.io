RVO is the second most common cause of vision loss from retinal vascular disease, following diabetic retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite many proposed interventions, there are no treatments proven to reopen occluded retinal veins. Management is directed at secondary complications of RVO that affect vision, including macular edema, retinal neovascularization, and anterior segment neovascularization. Effective treatment for macular capillary nonperfusion, a fourth cause of visual loss in RVO, is not available.</p><p>Treatment modalities, including medical therapies, laser photocoagulation, and other surgical therapies, will be discussed here. Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of RVO are discussed separately.

BRVO occurs when a vein in the distal retinal venous system is occluded, leading to hemorrhage along the distribution of a small vessel of the retina. CRVO occurs due to thrombus within the central retinal vein at the level of the lamina cribrosa of the optic nerve, leading to involvement of the entire retina. Less commonly, hemiretinal vein occlusion may occur when there is blockage of a vein draining the superior or inferior hemiretina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vein-occlusion-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7614340\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vein occlusion: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Newly diagnosed patients with ischemic CRVO can be categorized by their degree of visual loss and findings on examination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe visual loss</strong> &ndash; In patients with severe visual loss (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">20/400</span> visual acuity or less), relative afferent pupillary defect (eg, greater than 1 log unit as tested with neutral density filters), diffuse retinal hemorrhage (often representing indeterminate perfusion status), or retinal capillary nonperfusion (eg, greater than 10 disk areas by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography), monthly examinations for six to eight months after initial diagnosis is advised in order to detect development of retinal or anterior segment neovascularization. If there is progression of visual decline or increasing hemorrhage, monthly examinations should be extended until stability can be established for at least six to eight months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Non-severe visual loss</strong> &ndash; In patients without severe visual loss (eg, better than <span class=\"nowrap\">20/400</span> visual acuity) or any of the other above characteristics, a follow-up examination in one to three months with subsequent lengthening of intervals is advised until stability can be established at least 6 to 12 months.</p><p/><p>In patients with BRVO or CRVO without macular edema or neovascularization, we suggest observation rather than initiation of treatment.</p><p>Treatment is indicated in patients with RVO for macular edema, retinal neovascularization, and anterior segment neovascularization. Goals of treatment are to maintain central visual acuity by minimizing the effects of chronic macular edema, reducing the risk of bleeding into the vitreous cavity by producing regression of retinal neovascularization, and preventing neovascular glaucoma that can occur in eyes with severe disease. Treatment also involves management of predisposing risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension.

Intravitreal glucocorticoid therapy is considered an alternative for patients with edema refractory to anti-VEGF monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Grid laser photocoagulation therapy is another distant alternative for treatment of BRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] but has limited, if any, benefit in patients with CRVO. There is no established role for prophylactic therapy for macular edema with either anti-VEGF therapy or laser therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1034507060\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinal neovascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scatter laser photocoagulation is recommended to reduce the risk of visual impairment from vitreous hemorrhage (secondary bleeding into the vitreous cavity) for established neovascularization of the retina or optic disc due to RVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In BRVO, scatter laser photocoagulation is usually applied to the portion of the retina in the distribution of the occluded vein where retinal capillary nonperfusion most likely exists. The laser application is often guided by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography. In CRVO, the scatter laser treatment is applied throughout the fundus periphery, known as panretinal scatter laser retinal photocoagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1034507066\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior segment neovascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with established anterior segment neovascularization are at risk of neovascular glaucoma due to neovascularization that obstructs the trabecular meshwork and produces synechial angle closure glaucoma. Prophylactic scatter retinal photocoagulation is recommended to reduce this risk. In addition, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may be used as an adjunct to laser treatment. Anti-VEGF therapy may be used as a temporizing measure because the effects of laser take two to four weeks to develop. Additionally, in some patients laser cannot be performed initially because of anterior segment bleeding, elevated intraocular pressure, corneal edema, miosis, or extensive retinal hemorrhage preventing laser uptake.</p><p>Patients with severe (ischemic) CRVO are at particularly high risk for neovascular glaucoma, often within the first few months of diagnosis, and should be observed at least monthly for development of anterior segment neovascularization during this period. Such patients often present with severe visual loss, retinal hemorrhage, or evidence of extensive retinal capillary nonperfusion. Routine panretinal photocoagulation in patients with CRVO, prior to onset of anterior segment neovascularization, has not been shown to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13151886\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravitreal injections of pharmacologic agents have become first-line treatment for symptomatic macular edema from retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Long-term efficacy results (over two years) are available only for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>; data are not available regarding combination therapy with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and corticosteroid versus monotherapy. Technology assessments for the American Academy of Ophthalmology found that intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment was safe and effective for treatment of macular edema associated with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and that earlier treatment was associated with improved visual outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Drawbacks of intravitreal therapy include the need for multiple injections over periods of months to years and a remote risk of infectious endophthalmitis from the injection procedure that can result in catastrophic visual loss. Other risks of intravitreal injection include cataract, retinal detachment or tears, and intraocular hemorrhage. Safety related to the systemic effects of repeated courses of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy remains a topic of debate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101344539\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of clinical trials indicating the potential for visual improvement, intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs are first-line therapy for macular edema associated with BRVO and CRVO.</p><p>VEGF is a potent mitogen and vascular permeability factor that plays a pivotal role in neovascularization. Levels of VEGF are elevated in patients with CRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Anti-VEGF molecules limit the destructive effects of choroidal neovascular membranes in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-treatment-and-prevention#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Age-related macular degeneration: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'VEGF inhibitors and inhibitor-like drugs'</a>.)</p><p>VEGF inhibitors in patients with RVO are hypothesized to limit macular edema and improve vision by decreasing vascular permeability. Four anti-VEGF intravitreal agents are available for clinical use: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegaptanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegaptanib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a>. Only ranibizumab and aflibercept are approved for treatment of RVO by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There are no evidence-based criteria for determining which of these drugs to use, and clinical decisions are based mostly on medication cost.</p><p>Treatment is instituted soon after diagnosis of macular edema because a treatment delay of six months was found to be associated with failure to achieve the same degree of visual recovery when compared with immediate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/4,8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,16</a>]. In many clinical practices, periodic intravitreal injections are performed as necessary until macular edema remits, at which time treatment is discontinued and reinstituted as needed (a &quot;treat and observe&quot; approach). In one study in patients with either BRVO or CRVO whose disease was stable after seven months of monthly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a> injections, administering ranibizumab on an as-needed schedule, compared with continued monthly injections, resulted in no difference in visual acuity at 15 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In an alternative approach, intervals between treatments are gradually increased to a point when the clinician deems observation to be appropriate (a &quot;treat and extend&quot; approach). There are no studies comparing these two approaches in RVO management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13151991\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence of effectiveness for BRVO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several observational studies and randomized trials have found intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of macular edema from BRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>].</p><p>In the six-month BRAVO trial, in which 397 patients with macular edema from BRVO were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a> (0.3 or 0.5 mg intraocularly) or sham, more patients receiving low-dose and high-dose ranibizumab had improvements in visual acuity of at least 15 letters (55 and 61 versus 29 percent) and achieved visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> or better (68 and 65 versus 42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Treatment with ranibizumab results in durable benefit lasting four years or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The addition of laser therapy to ranibizumab does not lead to better functional outcomes in patients with BRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In a 24-week trial, monthly intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a> was shown to be superior to grid laser with a mean gain of 17.0 letters in the aflibercept group compared with 6.9 letters in the laser group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> has also been used to treat BRVO with macular edema.

Although not approved for intravitreal use, bevacizumab is considerably less expensive than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>. In patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, bevacizumab has demonstrated equivalent efficacy in comparison with ranibizumab.

Ranibizumab-treated eyes were also more likely to achieve visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;20/40</span> (44 and 47 percent versus 21 percent). Patients received intraocular ranibizumab injections as often as monthly if they met prespecified criteria (best-corrected visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;20/40</span> or mean central subfield thickness &gt;250 micron on optical coherence tomography).</p><p>An update to the CRUISE trial has extended and confirmed the results through month 12, with greater improvements in visual acuity in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a> group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a long-term follow-up of a subset of patients from the CRUISE trial, edema resolution occurred at 49 months in 44 percent of patients with CRVO treated with ranibizumab, but 56 percent still required frequent injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A similarly designed study (COPERNICUS) involving intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a> in patients with CRVO has also shown a beneficial effect on visual acuity at six months and one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], although visual acuity diminished somewhat when the dosing schedule changed at 24 weeks from monthly injections to injections as needed and to less frequent monitoring (at least quarterly) beyond one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Intravitreal aflibercept for CRVO was also compared with sham injections in the GALILEO Study, in which patients received injections every four weeks to week 24 and then as needed up to 76 weeks; patients in the aflibercept group had more visual and anatomic improvement at both 24 and 76 weeks, compared with the sham group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In the United States, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> is not approved to treat CRVO with macular edema, but it appears to be as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a> and is considerably less expensive. In a randomized controlled clinical trial of 362 patients with CRVO or hemiretinal vein occlusion, improvements in the visual acuity letter score were comparable in patients using intravitreal bevacizumab and aflibercept after six months of therapy (mean increase from baseline of 18.6 versus 18.9, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1946115879\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravitreal glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravitreal glucocorticoids are considered second-line pharmacologic therapy for RVO. Randomized trials and cohort studies have found that intravitreal glucocorticoid injections may improve visual acuity in patients with BRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>] and with CRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; however, a systematic review identified substantial loss of follow-up data in one of the randomized trials and concluded that evidence of visual improvement from intravitreal steroids for CRVO with macular edema should be interpreted with caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Intravitreal glucocorticoid injections, however, may cause adverse effects not commonly observed with anti-VEGF therapy, including cataract formation and moderate or severe increases in intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients require periodic monitoring for elevation of intraocular pressure and treatment of glaucoma, if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Intravitreal glucocorticoids are administered as injections or as a slow-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> implant delivered via a proprietary injection device. Some forms of intravitreal corticosteroid treatment, such as the dexamethasone intravitreal implant or intravitreal injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide, involve less frequent injections (every three to four months rather than monthly) than do intravitreal VEGF inhibitors. Reasonable candidates for intravitreal glucocorticoid therapy include patients who have responded poorly to anti-VEGF therapy or who are adverse to frequent intraocular injections. Pseudophakic patients without glaucoma are considered especially favorable candidates for glucocorticoid therapy because they are no longer at risk for steroid-induced cataract formation. Similarly, patients who have had previous glaucoma filtering procedures, and are thus at lower risk of steroid-induced elevated intraocular pressure, may be appropriate candidates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13152201\"><span class=\"h3\">Effectiveness of intravitreal injection of triamcinolone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Standard Care versus Corticosteroid for Retinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) trial for BRVO, intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> in doses of 1 or 4 mg were compared with macular grid laser photocoagulation in 411 patients with visual acuity loss from BRVO-related macular edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There was no difference in visual acuity between the treatment arms. Increasing intraocular pressure and cataract formation were more common in the triamcinolone arms, particularly the 4 mg treatment group. Given these complications, other therapies such as intravitreal anti-VEGF agents or macular grid laser photocoagulation are preferred options for patients with persistent vision loss secondary to BRVO-related macular edema. (See <a href=\"#H101344539\" class=\"local\">'Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7612439\" class=\"local\">'Retinal laser photocoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p>The SCORE trial for CRVO compared intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> (1 or 4 mg) with observation in patients with macular edema secondary to CRVO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients randomly assigned to triamcinolone had improved visual acuity after 12 months. The 4 mg triamcinolone group had higher rates of intraocular pressure elevation and cataract compared with 1 mg and control groups. After initial injection of triamcinolone, patients were retreated as needed at four-month intervals. This trial suggests that patients with visual acuity loss from macular edema secondary to CRVO may benefit, relative to observation alone, from treatment with 1 mg of preservative-free triamcinolone at baseline and at four-month intervals as needed for one year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13152213\"><span class=\"h3\">Effectiveness of glucocorticoid implant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In two six-month randomized trials in which 1267 patients with macular edema from either BRVO or CRVO were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> intravitreal implant (0.35 or 0.7 mg) versus sham, patients receiving implant treatment were more likely to have improvement of at least 15 letters over a 60- to 90-day observation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Laser treatment is noninvasive and accomplished in one or two clinic sessions, whereas anti-VEGF therapy may require multiple intravitreal injections over a period of months or years without a known, pre-established endpoint for a given patient.</p><p>There is no established role for laser photocoagulation as prophylaxis for macular edema or neovascularization.</p><p>There are three main forms of laser photocoagulation treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral scatter photocoagulation, which involves moderate laser burns distributed in a regularly spaced pattern throughout the portion of the peripheral retina in the distribution of the occluded vein. It is used for neovascularization in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panretinal scatter photocoagulation, which involves photocoagulation of the entire peripheral retina and is used for retinal or anterior segment neovascularization in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macular grid photocoagulation, which creates small, mild burns in a grid-like distribution over the macula and is used for macular edema in patients with BRVO who are adverse to intravitreal therapy. Grid laser photocoagulation may cause symptoms of permanent paracentral scotoma. Withholding grid laser for a period of three months after onset of symptoms is often recommended because macular edema can spontaneously remit. Grid photocoagulation has become second- or third-line treatment for macular edema after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and possibly intravitreal corticosteroid therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7612481\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although laser treatments for RVO are well-tolerated, there are rare complications (&lt;1 percent) that can lead to worsening visual acuity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retinal scarring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choroidal neovascularization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subretinal fibrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual field deterioration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paracentral scotomata</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7612544\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical intervention is not considered as primary therapy given associated surgical risks and lack of controlled trials showing benefit.</p><p>Surgery for branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is largely restricted to vitrectomy (surgical removal of the vitreous humor) with or without an arteriovenous sheathotomy, in which the overlying retinal artery is separated from the vein to improve blood flow. In a randomized trial comparing intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">vitrectomy/arteriovenous</span> sheathotomy in 40 eyes with BRVO-related macular edema, no differences were found in visual acuity or foveal thickness at three and six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from this study due to the short follow-up period and small sample size.</p><p>Studies evaluating surgical options in central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) are limited to small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vein-occlusion-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].
