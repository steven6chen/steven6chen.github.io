Stress fractures may be the result of a small number of repetitions with a relatively large load (eg, a military recruit marching for several miles with a heavy backpack), a large number of repetitions with a usual load (eg, an athlete training for a long-distance race), or a combination of increased load and increased repetitions.</p><p>An overview of the classification, risk factors, diagnosis, management, and prevention of stress fractures is presented here. Specific stress fractures are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-tibia-and-fibula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the tibia and fibula&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-metatarsal-shaft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the metatarsal shaft&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-humeral-shaft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the humeral shaft&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-fifth-metatarsal-fractures#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal fifth metatarsal fractures&quot;, section on 'Stress fractures of the proximal diaphysis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fracture</strong> &ndash; Fracture refers to the breaking of a bone. Complete fractures divide the affected bone into two or more pieces, while partial (incomplete) fractures do not extend through the cortex. An example of an incomplete fracture is the &quot;greenstick&quot; fracture, in which the convex side of a long bone is disrupted, while the concave surface remains intact. These are most common in children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stress fracture</strong> &ndash; A stress fracture occurs when a bone breaks after being subjected to repeated tensile or compressive stresses, none of which would be large enough individually to cause the bone to fail, in a person who is not known to have an underlying disease that would be expected to cause abnormal bone fragility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insufficiency fracture</strong> &ndash; An insufficiency fracture occurs when the mechanical strength of a bone is reduced to the point that a stress, which would not fracture a healthy bone, breaks the weak one. The condition that causes reduced bone strength typically does so throughout the skeleton (eg, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, or osteogenesis imperfecta) but may be more localized (eg, demineralization in a limb due to disuse).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Insufficiency fractures due to osteoporosis, pseudofractures, and radiolucent lines seen in the bones of patients with osteomalacia are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures: Clinical manifestations and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathologic fracture</strong> &ndash; A pathologic fracture is due to a localized loss of strength in a bone from a disease process immediately underlying the bone. Examples of pathologic fractures include those that occur at sites of bone tumors (primary or metastatic), bone cysts, and infections.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316780271\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone remodels in response to a mechanical stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The rate and amount of remodeling depends upon the number and frequency of loading cycles a bone is subjected to (Wolff's law). An abrupt increase in the duration, intensity, or frequency of physical activity without adequate periods of rest may lead to pathologic changes in bone. These pathologic changes result from an imbalance between bone resorption and formation. During periods of intense exercise, bone formation lags behind bone resorption. This renders the bone susceptible to microfractures. Bone responds to this microscopic injury with a reparative response that includes edema, which can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some of changes associated with stress fracture can appear on MRI before symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>With continued overload, microfractures may propagate (symptoms generally develop during this process) and eventually coalesce into a discontinuity within the cortical bone (ie, a stress fracture). Continued overload can complete the fracture and result in displacement at the fracture site. In summary, stress fracture represents one point on a spectrum of stress-induced bone changes referred to as stress injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION (GRADING AND RISK OF COMPLICATIONS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No gold standard classification system has been developed for describing stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Two clinically useful systems may be used: One describes severity based upon radiographic and clinical features; another categorizes fractures as either high-risk or low-risk based upon location. The system involving MRI findings is described below. (See <a href=\"#H198283485\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>Stress fractures have also been classified clinically on the basis of their risk of complications, particularly of displacement, nonunion, or fracture propagation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The distinction between &quot;low-risk&quot; and &quot;high-risk&quot; stress fractures is based primarily on the fracture site. Stress fractures at low-risk sites are unlikely to have any of these complications and are generally amenable to conservative management. In contrast, high-risk stress fractures are managed more aggressively, often surgically.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sites at <strong>LOW</strong> <strong>RISK</strong> of complications &ndash; Fractures of the second through fourth metatarsal shafts, posteromedial tibial shaft, proximal humerus or humeral shaft, ribs, sacrum, and pubic rami are considered low risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sites at <strong>HIGH RISK</strong> of complications:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spine: Pars interarticularis of the lumbar spine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hip and thigh: Femoral head; superior side of the femoral neck (ie, tension side)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Knee and leg: Patella; anterior cortex of the tibia (ie, tension side)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ankle and foot: Medial malleolus; talus; tarsal navicular; proximal fifth and fourth metatarsals; base of the second metatarsal; great toe sesamoids</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of stress fractures is less than 1 percent in the general population. The reported incidence in athletic populations varies with the type of athlete. Among military recruits, the incidence ranges from 1 to 31 percent, among runners 13 to 52 percent, and among participants in collegiate team sports 1 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of lower extremity stress fracture in all United States military members between 2009 and 2012 was 5.69 per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important risk factors for developing stress fractures include a history of prior stress fracture, low level of physical fitness, increasing volume and intensity of physical activity, female gender and menstrual irregularity, lower body mass index (BMI), diet poor in calcium, poor bone health, and poor biomechanics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79279\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79279 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior stress fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history stress fractures is a strong predictor of future stress fractures, according to several prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. The relative risk is over sixfold in distance runners and military recruits with a history of at least one stress fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Among track athletes, 60 percent of those who sustained a stress fracture had a history of stress fracture. The one-year recurrence rate in these athletes was 12.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497428574\"><span class=\"h2\">Activity-related factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Repetitive activities</strong> &ndash; Specific repetitive activities predispose athletes to site-specific stress fractures. As examples, throwing athletes have an increased risk of humeral and scapular fractures, while runners are at increased risk for pelvic and lower extremity fractures, primarily of the tibia and metatarsals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/4,6,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,12,13</a>]. Gymnasts have an increased risk for stress fractures of the spine, wrist, and foot. Stress fractures of the ribs may be seen in golfers and rowers. The following table lists the stress fractures associated with particular sports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93236 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Weightbearing bones, primarily those of the lower extremity, are at greatest risk for stress fracture. As an example, tibial fractures accounted for 49 percent of all stress fractures seen in athletes, followed in frequency by fractures of the metatarsals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Greater than 12 hours of exercise per week is a risk factor for bone stress injury in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Non-athletes who abruptly increase their level of activity may also be at risk for stress fracture. An example would be the patient whose activity was restricted by the pain of arthritis who resumes walking after joint replacement surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased physical fitness</strong> &ndash; Decreased muscle strength and endurance are associated with an increased incidence of stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Muscles play a supportive role in bone health; when muscles are weak or fatigued, other musculoskeletal structures absorb greater impact. A dramatic increase in physical training may overwhelm the bone's capacity to compensate with normal remodeling. Specific factors associated with higher rates of stress fractures include &gt;1 cm decrease in calf girth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], less lean mass in the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], less than seven months of prior strength training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and poor lower extremity muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Rowers with lower knee extensor to elbow extensor strength ratios also had a higher incidence of rib stress fractures in one retrospective case control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although muscle inflexibility has long been cited as a possible risk factor for stress fracture, its role remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among several prospective studies looking at ankle dorsiflexion, one found restricted flexibility to be associated with stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], while two found no association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>]. One prospective study found decreased hamstring flexibility to be associated with tibial stress fractures in runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower exercise levels prior to military training</strong> &ndash; Two prospective studies have reported that lower exercise levels (which is different than fitness level) confers a higher risk of stress fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/10,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25</a>]. Among United States Marine recruits, those who self-classified their activity level before basic training as &quot;inactive&quot; had a sixfold higher rate of stress fracture than those with &quot;below average&quot; or higher activity levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The incidence among Chinese military recruits with a history of less than seven hours a day of exercise before basic training was nearly twice that of recruits with more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Worn footwear</strong> &ndash; Recruits who begin basic training using old shoes have a higher incidence of stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Running surface</strong> &ndash; Two retrospective studies found no association between running surface and stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], but one found that running on a treadmill reduced tibial strain compared with over-ground running [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161788938\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inadequate vitamin D and calcium</strong> &ndash; Vitamin D and calcium are essential for bone health and fracture prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. When the amounts of these nutrients are inadequate, bone is weakened and is potentially more susceptible to fractures of any kind.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A systematic review of eight observational studies, including 761 cases of stress fracture, reported an association between low serum 25(OH)D (hydroxy vitamin D) concentrations and lower extremity stress fractures among military personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A prospective, nested case-control study in female United States Navy recruits found that women in the lowest quintile of 25OHD serum concentrations (1.5 to 19.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> had twice the risk of stress fracture compared with women in the highest quintile (over 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was also seen in a high percentage (63 percent) of adolescents with pars interarticularis stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Calcium and vitamin D'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H1550488489\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Optimal intake to prevent deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Case-control studies show that lower calcium intake is associated with an increase in stress fracture incidence in women, with a relative risk of 1.1 per 100 mg decreased intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disordered eating</strong> &ndash; Restricted caloric intake in female track and field athletes, gymnasts, and dancers correlates with an increased incidence of stress fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/18,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,35</a>]. Disordered eating deprives the body of the nutrients needed for bone and muscle metabolism, in addition to other health risks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161789082\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic and biomechanical factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review found that extreme foot arch morphologies (pes planus or cavus) likely increase risk for tibial stress fractures, but no definitive conclusions could be drawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Specific biomechanical characteristics during the ground contact phases of running may predispose athletes to stress fractures. Preliminary retrospective studies show that increased tibial striking torque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], increased tibial shock and vertical load rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and earlier hindfoot eversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] are associated with higher tibial stress fracture rates.</p><p>One large prospective study showed that a shorter duration of foot pronation during landing was associated with increased risk of tibial and femoral stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Neither maximal pronation angle nor pronation mean angular velocity appeared to increase risk. This suggests that how far the foot pronates during contact with the ground is not as important as how well the subtalar joint controls the duration of pronation. Further studies are needed to clarify these risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161789304\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional risk factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Female gender</strong> &ndash; Females are at greater risk than males of developing stress fractures. Relative risk ranges from 1.2 to 10 depending upon the population studied (eg, athletes versus general population) and the fractures considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/4,5,9,13,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9,13,41,42</a>] Women have 51 times the rate of sacral stress fractures but 3.4 times the rate of pubic ramus and proximal tibial stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although the reasons for the gender discrepancy remain unproven, higher rates of risk factors, such as decreased bone mineral density and disordered eating, likely contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/4,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,43</a>]. Menstrual irregularity is an independent risk factor for stress fractures in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/6,19,33,41,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19,33,41,44,45</a>]. The combination of decreased bone density, disordered eating leading to poor energy availability, and amenorrhea comprises the &quot;female athlete triad,&quot; which places a woman at greatly increased risk of stress fractures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>). Even women without the entire syndrome but with one or two components show a markedly increased risk for developing bone stress injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Poor physical fitness may predispose some women to developing stress fractures. Studies of female military recruits show that many women begin basic training at lower physical fitness levels than their male counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; The incidence of stress fractures is greatest in patients aged 17 to 26 years, but this likely has more to do with increased activity than age, per se. Two large prospective studies of military recruits found increased risk of stress fractures as age increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/20,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,42</a>], and one reported a bimodal distribution with increased risk in those under 20 and over 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased bone density</strong> &ndash; Lower bone mineral density, as assessed by quantitative ultrasonography or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, strongly correlates with an increased incidence of stress fractures in both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/6,18,33,48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18,33,48-51</a>]. A family history of osteopenia or osteoporosis is associated with a threefold higher risk of stress fractures in adolescent female athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

This may seem counter-intuitive, as a higher BMI places greater mechanical stresses on weight-bearing bones during exercise. However, low BMI is associated with lower bone density, which is an independent risk factor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other factors </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Race/ethnicity</span> other than black conferred significant risk in a large, prospective study of basic combat training in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Radiographic findings of femoroacetabular impingement may be a risk factor for femoral neck stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early diagnosis is essential to avoid complications and a prolonged delay in return to activity. Often the history and physical examination provide sufficient information for clinicians to diagnose and manage low-risk stress fractures. Key features include a history of localized pain of insidious onset that increases with activity and focal tenderness limited to the stress fracture site. Plain radiographs are recommended initially, but advanced imaging is only needed when high-risk stress fractures are suspected, early definitive diagnosis is necessary, or patients are not responding to usual treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging technique to make a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical classification (grading and risk of complications)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>The author treats clinically suspected low-risk stress fractures empirically and reserves advanced imaging for suspected high-risk stress fracture, or low-risk fractures that are not responding after several weeks of treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114447\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114447 \">algorithm 1</a>).

The clinician should inquire about likely risk factors and solicit a detailed description of the pain and any antecedent physical activity. Particularly important are recent changes in activity level and participation in athletic activities. Often, patients describe starting a new training program or significant changes in their training regimen (eg, boot camp, addition of hill runs, transition to a harder training surface). The following table lists the stress fractures associated with particular sports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93236 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>A dietary history is valuable for both men and women to exclude eating disorders and dietary deficiency of calcium or vitamin D. A menstrual history will help to screen for potential hormonal deficiencies.</p><p>Clinicians should look for risk factors by inquiring about the patient's general health, past and current medical conditions, medications, alcohol and tobacco use, occupation, previous injuries, and family history (especially of osteoporosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain description</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients classically report the insidious onset of localized pain. The pain is initially related to activity and increases in severity with increased activity. If the patient continues in the inciting activity, symptoms worsen. Eventually the pain is present during less strenuous activity and ultimately during rest. Occasionally, the patient experiences an abrupt increase in pain at the site of milder chronic symptoms indicating that a repeatedly stressed area of bone has completely fractured. Less frequently, a patient's initial presentation may involve the acute onset of severe pain, resulting from a complete fracture at the site of a preexisting stress fracture. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tenderness of the affected bone is the most sensitive physical finding for diagnosing a stress fracture. Tenderness is usually limited to the site of injury, unless a complete fracture is present, in which case the area of tenderness may be wider due to bleeding and inflammation.</p><p>Many stress fractures are preceded by a bone stress injury of lesser severity that may be more diffuse. As an example, shin splints often precede the development of a stress fracture of the medial tibial border, in which case, tenderness may be present along several centimeters of the tibial shaft. However, once a fracture develops the site of injury will likely demonstrate more focal tenderness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity#H24287212\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) and tibial stress fractures'</a>.)</p><p>In areas where little soft tissue covers the injured bone, there may be subtle soft tissue swelling over the stress fracture, and occasionally mild erythema. Bony callus may be palpable in chronic, severe cases. Defects of the cortical surface and bony crepitus are not present.</p><p>When the fracture site is not easily palpable, maneuvers to stress the bone at the area of pain may aid diagnosis. The fulcrum test may be useful when long bones are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. It is performed by placing one hand under the area that is painful and applying steady pressure while the other hand applies steady pressure at the end of the same bone. This creates a fulcrum effect that stresses the site of suspected injury. Increased pain at the area in question during the test is consistent with a stress fracture. The fulcrum test is neither sensitive nor specific, and imaging is needed to make a precise diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Some clinicians use the hop test to help diagnose femoral neck stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This test simply involves having the patient hop on the affected leg, which typically reproduces pain at the fracture site. The patient should stop hopping immediately if significant pain develops around the hip or groin while performing the test. While suggestive of injury, the hop test is nonspecific and confirmatory imaging is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. Some authors have expressed concern that repeated hopping risks converting the rare tension-side femoral neck stress fracture into a complete fracture, but we know of no actual cases where this has occurred. For patients who may have a femoral neck stress fracture and experience pain simply bearing weight, it is prudent to prescribe non-weightbearing status until appropriate imaging can be obtained.</p><p>The technique of placing a vibrating tuning fork directly over an area of injury to induce pain at a stress fracture site has shown widely disparate sensitivity and specificity in two studies and therefore cannot be recommended as a method to identify a stress fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Therapeutic ultrasound (US) placed in a similar manner had a pooled sensitivity of 64 percent and specificity of 63 percent for identifying stress fractures in one systematic review of seven studies, and thus its usefulness for diagnosis is also limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Compared to bone scan, US demonstrated a sensitivity of 43 percent and specificity of 49 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Biomechanical evaluation of the affected region should be done to identify factors that may have predisposed to injury or affect healing. In general, the entire affected limb and its attachments to the axial skeleton should be evaluated whenever a stress fracture is suspected.

Plain radiographs should be obtained initially and are helpful when positive due to their high specificity, but they are insensitive. If plain radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high and a need for definitive diagnosis exists, MRI is recommended because it is both sensitive and specific. Bone scan is sensitive but nonspecific. Computed tomography (CT) is used as an adjunct if extensive bony injury is suspected because it provides greater anatomic detail of bone. Plain radiographs, MRI, and bone scan each have an associated injury severity grading system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58048\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58048 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>A systematic review of 21 studies, nearly all of high or moderate quality, of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for lower extremity stress fractures found MRI to be the most sensitive and most specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Bone scan was not recommended when MRI was available due to its low specificity (range 33 to 98 percent) and high ionizing radiation dose. CT was not recommended due to its high false-negative rate. The value of plain radiography lay in its specificity but was limited by a high false-negative rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographs should be obtained but are typically normal for the first two to three weeks after the onset of symptoms, and findings may take months to appear. Periosteal elevation, cortical thickening, sclerosis, and a true fracture line are all examples of positive findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62977\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62977 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69856\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69856 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73240\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73240 \">image 3</a>). Severity grading based on appearance is described in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58048\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58048 \">table 3</a>). Although such findings are specific, plain radiographs have poor sensitivity in the detection of stress fractures. Of note, periosteal elevation on plain radiograph correlates closely with high-grade stress fracture on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Approach to stress fracture imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>MRI appears to be useful in determining the severity along the spectrum of bone stress injury and is better at differentiating pathologic fractures from stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. When an intraarticular stress fracture is suspected, MRI better distinguishes bone injury from ligament or cartilage injury. Additionally, MRI does not entail ionizing radiation, may be less expensive than a bone scan, and provides information about injury to surrounding soft tissues.</p><p>Though more specific than a bone scan, MRI findings must be interpreted with caution, especially when no clear fracture is present. Asymptomatic tibial stress reactions are seen in 43 percent of asymptomatic runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Findings such as isolated bone marrow edema are nonspecific, and can occur with bone tumors, avascular necrosis, and osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Correlation of MRI findings with the history and physical examination is critical for accurate diagnosis. MRI findings consistent with a stress fracture range from periosteal or bone marrow edema to frank cortical fracture lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p>A system to grade bone stress injury severity based on MRI findings has been developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58048\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58048 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Grade 1 (mild) fractures show only periosteal edema, grade 2 (moderate) fractures show bone marrow edema on T2-weighted images; grade 3 (severe) fractures show marrow edema on both T1- and T2-weighted images; and grade 4 (severe) fractures show a cortical fracture line in addition to edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. A simplified system has been proposed in which Grades 1 and 2 fractures are termed &quot;low-grade&quot; and grades 3 and 4 are termed &quot;high-grade&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The use of these grading systems helps clinicians provide information about time to recovery.

However, the specificity of bone scan is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Approximately 40 percent of positive findings occur at asymptomatic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Bone scans can also be falsely positive with shin splints. Areas of increased uptake may represent subclinical sites of bone remodeling or stress reactions. Increased uptake can also appear in the setting of bone tumors, osteomyelitis, or avascular necrosis. Although rare, there are reports of false-negative bone scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/60,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,65</a>]. Because of these limitations, MRI is supplanting bone scan as the diagnostic study of choice when plain radiographs are negative and confirmation of suspected stress fracture is needed. (See <a href=\"#H198283485\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Acute stress fractures appear as discrete, localized, sometimes linear areas of increased uptake on all three phases (angiographic, soft tissue, and delayed phases) of a technetium-99 methylene diphosphonate bone scan. In contrast, shin splints are typically positive only during the delayed phase of the scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. A system to grade stress fracture severity based on bone scan findings has been developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58048\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58048 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is limited as a primary diagnostic imaging modality by its high false-negative rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. It can be considered if MRI is unavailable or inconclusive, but is it also useful as an adjunct study when plain films are positive and extensive bony injury is suspected, because it provides greater anatomic detail of bone involvement. CT can also show fracture lines in long bones. In the setting of a negative plain radiograph and a positive bone scan, CT can differentiate between fracture and stress reaction, or other conditions of the bone such as tumor or osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography (US) continues to gain popularity as an imaging tool for musculoskeletal conditions, particularly as image resolution improves and clinicians gain experience. US can display several findings suggestive of stress fracture, including hematoma, periosteal elevation, hypervascularity, and cortical defect over the area of tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. A systematic review of seven high-quality studies found US to be more sensitive than specific, signifying a low false-negative rate but a high false-positive rate in diagnosing tibia and metatarsal stress fractures, and concluded that it is best used (in trained hands) to rule out a stress fracture based on negative findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several disorders can present with localized musculoskeletal pain. Tendinopathy, muscle strains, joint sprains, nerve entrapment syndromes, and compartment syndrome share some features with stress fractures. Bone stress reactions probably represent precursor lesions that will progress to stress fractures if the sites are not protected from further insults. Among runners, medial tibial stress syndrome (ie, &quot;shin splints&quot;) is the most common example of this phenomenon. Neoplasm and infection represent the most worrisome diagnoses in the differential list. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity#H24287212\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) and tibial stress fractures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tendinopathy </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Overuse syndromes frequently are due to tendinopathy, a condition characterized by chronic pain in the affected tendon. Onset is usually insidious. Tenderness is localized to the affected tendon, which can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from the underlying bones. Pain may be reproduced by passive stretch and resisted contraction of the affected tendon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscle strain</strong> &ndash; Localized pain may develop acutely or insidiously as a result of isolated trauma or repeated minor injuries to one or more muscles. Tenderness and pain with passive stretch or resisted contraction of the involved muscle are indicative of a muscle strain. A localized hematoma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palpable depression may develop at the site of a sizable muscle tear. Although radiographs do not reveal a fracture, this is also often true with stress fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity#H2791029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Labral tear'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ligament sprain</strong> &ndash; Ligamentous injuries are typically the result of a single episode of trauma, though repeated injury may lead to a subacute or chronic disorder that could raise suspicion for stress fracture. Tenderness with sprains is generally localized to the area of the affected ligaments. Stressing the ligaments reproduces or exacerbates the pain, and may reveal ligamentous laxity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nerve entrapment syndromes</strong> &ndash; In addition to pain, other neurologic symptoms, particularly paresthesia, numbness, and weakness, may be clues to the presence of a nerve entrapment syndrome of the upper or lower extremity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exertional compartment syndrome</strong> &ndash; Compartment syndromes are caused by increased tissue pressure within a fascial compartment that compromises local circulation and neuromuscular function. In susceptible individuals, the compartment pressure increases with exercise, resulting in exercise-induced pain, tightness, distal paresthesia, muscle weakness, or numbness. Symptoms usually resolve within several minutes of rest. There may be no symptoms or diagnostic signs at rest; provocative testing and compartment pressure testing may be necessary. A more detailed discussion of exertional compartment syndrome is found separately.

Unlike a stress fracture, the patient with shin splints has no discrete bone tenderness. Instead, diffuse tenderness over the middle to distal third of the tibial border (usually medial but sometimes lateral) is typically present. However, if overuse continues, shin splints may progress to a stress fracture without a clear demarcation of this change, and distinguishing between the two can sometimes be difficult clinically. Like stress fractures, shin splints develop in people who suddenly increase their level of physical activity. The change may be in intensity, frequency, or type of exercise. The most frequently associated exercise is running. Shin splints are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity#H24287212\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) and tibial stress fractures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neoplasm</strong> &ndash; Bone pain due to neoplasm is generally characterized as being focal and constant. Painful benign and malignant neoplasms of bone can generally be differentiated from stress fractures by imaging studies. Lytic, blastic, and mixed lesions may be appreciated on plain radiographs. Malignant tumors may arise primarily from bone or be metastatic. The approach to the diagnosis of primary bone tumors and bone pain due to cancer, and the evaluation of a patient with a complete or impending pathologic fracture, are discussed separately.

It can occur at any age and at different anatomic sites. Among adolescents and young adults, osteomyelitis of long bones is most prevalent and may present in similar fashion to a stress fracture. Bone infection that results from a contiguous soft tissue infection should be readily recognized in the extremities, but may be more difficult to differentiate from a stress fracture in the bones of the pelvis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hematogenous seeding in older children and young adults generally affects the ends of long bones, while in skeletally mature adults the vertebrae are most often affected. Laboratory tests and imaging studies may have some value, but it is NOT possible to exclude osteomyelitis on the basis of noninvasive studies. The clinical features and the approach to diagnosis of osteomyelitis are discussed elsewhere.

A patient may also require early surgical intervention if there is evidence of nonunion (ie, cyst formation or sclerosis surrounding the fracture) because such fractures are less likely to heal by conservative measures alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3742047122\"><span class=\"h2\">Elements of conservative care</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ice (applied locally for 15 minutes every three hours as needed) and pain medication (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or low potency opiates) are used to control acute pain. The effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on fracture healing is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Possible effect on fracture healing'</a>.)</p><p>Excessive analgesia may mask pain, making it difficult to gauge appropriate increases in physical activity during rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. It is prudent to use as little analgesic medication as possible and to strongly discourage using analgesics as a means to increase pain-free activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45\"><span class=\"h3\">Protection of the fracture site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The forces exerted on the injured bone must be reduced such that pain is eliminated in order to allow for bone remodeling and healing. As examples, high-risk femoral head and tension-side femoral neck stress fractures should be treated with crutches and complete non-weightbearing as soon as clinically suspected and continued until orthopedic consultation is obtained.</p><p>Other pelvic or lower extremity stress fractures should be treated with reduced weightbearing if walking causes persistent pain. In many foot stress fractures, protection with a Controlled Ankle Motion (CAM) boot, hard sole shoe, fracture boot, or leg splint eliminates pain with walking.</p><p>Bracing may be helpful in some instances, but studies may be limited depending on the type of stress fracture and clinical context. Use of a calf length pneumatic brace for tibial stress fractures may reduce the time until pain-free return to play for some patients. Bracing of the spine may be indicated for some stress fractures of the pars interarticularis; orthopedic consultation is recommended for such injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-tibia-and-fibula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the tibia and fibula&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46\"><span class=\"h3\">Activity modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modification of activities that place stress on the affected bone is critical to the successful treatment of stress fractures. Pain is typically used to judge the efficacy of activity modification. Simply put, activities should be limited to those that are pain-free. Failure to do so may prolong healing time and increase the risk of completed fracture or nonunion.</p><p>Active individuals will not tolerate long periods of inactivity. It is mentally untenable and leads to cardiopulmonary deconditioning and muscle atrophy. Instead, patients should be encouraged to engage in activities that closely approximate their desired activity but are pain-free. For instance, runners may walk briskly, use elliptical machines, perform shallow-end aquatic therapy or deep water running, or run on a reduced-weightbearing treadmill machine. Cycling and swimming are excellent alternatives.</p><p>As healing progresses, exercises involving increasing amounts of bone stress can be added gradually as tolerated, using pain as a guide. Should the patient experience any pain at the fracture site, the activity should be replaced by an exercise that places less stress upon the healing bone.</p><p>Preventive measures should be considered, as discussed below, in order to reduce the risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H61\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47\"><span class=\"h3\">Rehabilitative exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Athletes, laborers, and patients with biomechanical problems predisposing to injury should participate in rehabilitation supervised by a knowledgeable physical therapist, athletic trainer, or comparable professional. The key principle during rehabilitation is protected, gradually progressive exercise that allows for adequate bone healing while promoting cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and flexibility. If supervised rehabilitation is not possible, education, home exercises, and close follow-up with the treating clinician are advisable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56321349\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcium and vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the evidence supporting these treatments is limited and based primarily upon studies of fracture prevention, throughout the course of treatment for a stress fracture, we suggest taking additional daily calcium (1500 mg) and vitamin D (800 international units) to help ensure fracture healing. Calcium intake may be increased through dietary changes or supplementation; vitamin D intake is typically increased with oral supplements. (See <a href=\"#H2161788938\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional factors'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9471818\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapies of uncertain benefit</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Therapeutic ultrasound</strong> &ndash; Multiple studies suggest that US accelerates the healing of acute fractures, but evidence for its efficacy in stress fractures is mixed. Several randomized trials have reported no clinical benefit in stress fractures treated with low intensity pulsed US (LIPUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>]. However, two randomized trials, one blinded and one not, in Indian soldiers found US treatment substantially reduced the time until return to full duty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. These protocols used 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">Watt/cm&sup2;</span> of US energy for five minutes a day at the fracture site, in addition to usual conservative therapy. LIPUS may be effective for particular types of stress fractures, but further analysis is needed to determine whether this is so and what protocols may be most effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy</strong> &ndash; Reports of successful treatment of stress fracture with ECSWT in humans is limited to case studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Controlled trials are needed before the effectiveness of ECSWT for the treatment of stress fractures can be determined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications</strong> &ndash; A small retrospective cases series of subchondral stress fractures of the knee showed markedly faster healing by MRI assessment at 3 and 12 months in patients treated with the prostacyclin analogue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloprost</a> compared to those treated with the analgesic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Those with high occupational or athletic demands warrant more frequent evaluation than recreational patients. Pain should progressively subside with treatment. If symptoms persist after several weeks, compliance with the treatment regimen should be ascertained. Compliant patients with persistent pain may need more restrictive activity modification, further protection of the bone, and a more gradual rehabilitation program. Imaging is needed if there is no clinical improvement despite six additional weeks of conservative management, including the additional measures described.</p><p>Once radiographs, MRI, bone scan, or CT confirms the diagnosis of stress fracture, the clinician rarely needs subsequent imaging. Radiographic healing lags behind clinical healing, and both bone scan and MRI may remain positive for up to 12 months following the original injury. Clinical response to treatment should suffice as confirmation of healing for almost all patients. Additional imaging plays a role only when the clinical response to treatment fails to progress appropriately. In this case, repeat imaging will determine if the fracture has extended or developed an area of nonunion. CT images the fracture line in long bones better than plain radiography, bone scan, or MRI. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56\"><span class=\"h1\">ORTHOPEDIC CONSULTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prompt surgical referral (within a few days) is recommended for high-risk fracture sites, which have higher rates of nonunion and progression to complete fracture. Orthopedic referral is appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate a lengthy rehabilitation process, such as a laborer whose livelihood depends upon a timely return to work or some high-level athletes. Should conservative treatment fail, surgical consultation should be obtained, generally after repeat imaging reveals the fracture has extended or a nonunion has developed. Of note, evidence supporting the role of surgery in the treatment of stress fractures is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-fractures/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Pain description'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic imaging is needed when high-risk stress fractures are suspected or a definitive diagnosis is necessary. Plain radiographs should be obtained initially and are helpful when positive due to their high specificity, but they are insensitive. Magnetic resonance imaging is recommended if plain radiographs are negative, but clinical suspicion remains high, and a need for definitive diagnosis exists. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for stress fracture includes tendinopathy, muscle strain, joint sprain, nerve entrapment, exertional compartment syndrome, neoplasm, and infection.
