In addition, breastfeeding is associated with benefits to the mother during lactation and long-term. There are also significant economic benefits for the family and society.</p><p>The maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding will be reviewed here. The benefits of breastfeeding for the infant are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MATERNAL BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with infants, breastfeeding provides direct clinical benefits to mothers during lactation and long-term benefits beyond the breastfeeding period. In a report for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, review of the literature demonstrated benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefits during lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits to mothers while breastfeeding include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceleration of recovery from childbirth by oxytocin's action on uterine involution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Oxytocin secretion is stimulated by breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction of maternal response to stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. It has been suggested that the neuroendocrine peptides, oxytocin and prolactin, are important components of the stress axis and have a positive impact on social behaviors including maternal-infant bonding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Lower rates of maternal neglect and child abuse have also been observed in breastfeeding infants compared to those who are formula fed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss after pregnancy may be enhanced by breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolongation of postpartum anovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Although breastfeeding prolongs anovulation, it should not be considered an entirely reliable means of contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term benefits</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of both breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. These associations are discussed elsewhere in the program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H6092327\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Breastfeeding'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women#H1202289\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;, section on 'Breastfeeding'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H2482190994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Breastfeeding'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unclear whether breastfeeding decreases the risk of osteoporosis. In premenopausal women, higher peak bone mass is associated with lower risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Indirect support for lactation's potential protective role against osteoporosis is provided by several studies that have shown that lactation increased bone mineral density (BMD), compared with nonlactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. One study, utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988 to 1994), found that women who breastfed as adolescents had a BMD (measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) that was 5 to 10 percent greater than those who did not breastfeed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, others have not found an association between breastfeeding and subsequent higher BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. It remains unclear whether lactation reduces the risk of osteoporosis and further studies are required.</p><p>In one study, a history of lactation was shown to confer a protective effect against osteoporosis and bone fracture in women over 65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, another study with a similar study population failed to replicate this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cumulative lactation appears to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as demonstrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from the Women's Health Initiative of postmenopausal women, multivariate-adjusted analysis showed women who breastfed were less likely than those who never breastfed to have hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Longer accumulation of breastfeeding led to lower rates of CVD and related risk factors. Over the 7.9 years of the study, women with a single live birth who breast-fed for 7 to 12 months were less likely to develop CVD compared to those who had never breast-fed (Hazard ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 TO 0.97).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report from the Nurse's Health Study, multivariate-adjusted analysis demonstrated women who had breastfed for a lifetime total of two years of more compared to women who had never breastfed had a lower risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio of 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from the Study of Women Across the Nation-Heart Study, women who breastfed all of their children for at least three months compared with those who never breastfed were less likely to have vascular changes associated with CVD (ie, carotid artery and aortic calcification), after adjusting for other variables associated with CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 846 women who gave birth in the mid-1980s, cumulative duration of lactation over the subsequent 20 years was inversely associated with atherosclerosis (as measured by carotid intima-media thickness), after adjustment for obesity, smoking and several other CVD-associated variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 607 mothers from the Women and Infants Study of Healthy Hearts, multivariate analysis adjusting for confound factors showed that women who never breastfed, compared with those who did, were more likely to have vascular findings associated with a greater risk of CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. &#160; &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1685086987\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding has been associated with reduced risk for developing type 2 diabetes during the years after delivery. This protective effect of breastfeeding has been shown for women with gestational diabetes mellitus that resolved after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and also for those without gestational diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and is independent of lactation-induced weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ECONOMIC BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The economic advantages of breastfeeding can be tangibly calculated at the family and national levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The obvious advantage for a family is in the savings accrued by not buying formula, a figure conservatively estimated to be about $1000 per year. In addition, the decreased risk of illness in breast-fed infants results in fewer outpatient visits and hospitalizations. For the individual family, this translates to decreased out-of-pocket expenditures for co-payments for visits and medications, and decreased work absences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Societal benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The societal benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for six months include an enormous economic savings and a reduction in infant mortality.</p><p>Savings come from a combined reduction in household expenditure on formula, as well as reductions in expenditures for health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As an example, the annual costs of <strong>not</strong> breastfeeding were computed for a health maintenance organization population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Compared with never breastfeeding, those infants who breastfed for &ge;three months had fewer medical office visits, medications, procedures, and hospitalizations. This amounted to a saving of $331 per single infant in short-term acute medical care costs only. In the managed care setting, full breastfeeding is estimated to reduce by 20 percent the total medical expenses compared with never breastfeeding. Not included in these cost estimates are the fewer work absences of families who are breastfeeding their infants.</p><p>In another analysis using the above methodology, the estimated national cost savings would be 13 billion dollars for the year 2007 if 80 to 90 percent of families in the United States complied with the recommendation to exclusively breastfeed for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, an excess of 911 deaths (mostly infants) would be avoided.</p><p>Furthermore, the cost savings from long-term benefits of breastfeeding, such as reducing the incidence of chronic diseases in childhood and reducing the incidence of breast cancer in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], would be substantial. Thus, the economic incentives for a society to breastfeed are strong and should be promoted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3502757964\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
