Infection usually involves cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues but can occasionally occur in other sites, primarily in immunocompromised patients. Activities associated with the development of sporotrichosis include landscaping, rose gardening, and other activities that involve inoculation of soil through the skin.</p><p>The typical and atypical clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and the diagnosis and treatment of these infections will be reviewed here. Mycology and epidemiology of sporotrichosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic biology and epidemiology of sporotrichosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of sporotrichosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sporotrichosis usually arises after soil, moss, or other organic material containing the fungus is inoculated into the skin or subcutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with pulmonary infection develop infection after inhalation of <em>S. schenckii</em> conidia; some cases of disseminated infection presumably also follow inhalation.</p><p>The typical host with lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis is a healthy individual with an outdoor occupation or avocation that provides exposure to the fungus. Infections involving osteoarticular structures, lungs, meninges, and other viscera are uncommon and occur most often in individuals with underlying illnesses including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis is the most common form of sporotrichosis seen in clinical practice. Days to weeks after cutaneous inoculation of the fungus, a papule develops at the site of inoculation. This primary lesion usually ulcerates but may remain nodular with overlying erythema; drainage from the lesion is not grossly purulent and has no odor. Similar lesions subsequently occur along lymphatic channels proximal to the original lesion, a finding called sporotrichoid spread or nodular lymphangitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65985%7EID%2F50115\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65985 graphicRef50115 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Pain is generally mild and systemic symptoms are typically absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis for this form of sporotrichosis includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, especially <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocardia infections, particularly <em>Nocardia brasiliensis</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Leishmania brasiliensis</em> infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tularemia</p><p/><p>However, many other fungal, bacterial, and viral infections rarely cause a lymphocutaneous syndrome (also called nodular lymphangitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphangitis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphangitis&quot;, section on 'Nodular lymphangitis'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients have a chronic, fixed cutaneous lesion; this form is seen most often in endemic regions in South America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74340 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74515\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74515 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56900 \">picture 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These fixed lesions, frequently found on the face and extremities, tend to be plaque-like or verrucous, but they also may ulcerate. The cutaneous form will not resolve without therapy although the lesion may appear to regress and flare periodically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary sporotrichosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for pulmonary sporotrichosis include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12</a>]. Symptoms mimic those of tuberculosis, including constitutional complaints of fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue as well as respiratory complaints including dyspnea, cough, purulent sputum, and hemoptysis. The chest radiographic findings are also similar to tuberculosis: unilateral or bilateral upper lobe cavities with variable amounts of fibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scattered nodular lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51548\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51548 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Some patients with pulmonary involvement have evidence of dissemination to skin, osteoarticular structures, or viscera. Almost without exception, untreated pulmonary sporotrichosis progresses to death. The differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis; chronic fungal infections, especially histoplasmosis; and sarcoidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoarticular sporotrichosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like pulmonary sporotrichosis, this uncommon manifestation of sporotrichosis is found most often in middle-aged men and appears to occur more frequently in alcoholics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Disease usually arises from hematogenous spread, but may also occur after local inoculation. Infection may involve one or several joints, and may or may not be accompanied by overlying cutaneous lesions. The most commonly affected joints are the knee, elbow, wrist, and ankle.</p><p>Joint infection is more common than osteomyelitis. When bone is involved, it usually occurs contiguous to an infected joint rather than as isolated osteomyelitis. Bursitis and tenosynovitis have been reported, sometimes presenting as a nerve entrapment syndrome.</p><p>Osteoarticular sporotrichosis is chronic with progressive decreased range of motion, pain, and swelling. Draining sinuses can be a late manifestation. Because diagnosis is often delayed, the outcome is poor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Meningeal sporotrichosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meningitis is a rare manifestation of sporotrichosis, occurring mostly in those with cellular immune defects, such as lymphoma or AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Meningitis may be an isolated finding or a manifestation of disseminated disease. In those patients who have isolated meningitis, the course is usually chronic and symptoms include weeks to months of fever and headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid findings are similar to those seen with tuberculosis or cryptococcosis, including lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-seronegative-patients#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in HIV-seronegative patients&quot;, section on 'Cerebrospinal fluid'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Disseminated sporotrichosis and other localized visceral infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disseminated sporotrichosis is very uncommon, with cases occurring primarily in patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/6,13,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14,16</a>]. <em>S. schenckii</em> rarely causes infection of the pericardium, eye, perirectal tissues, larynx, breast, epididymis, spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/1,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105584859\"><span class=\"h2\">Sporotrichosis in patients with HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most case reports of sporotrichosis in HIV-infected patients have noted the propensity for severe infection and the occurrence mostly in patients with advanced AIDS with very low CD4 counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>]. In addition, an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome leading to worsening cutaneous lesions in patients with disseminated sporotrichosis has been described when antiretroviral therapy was initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The largest series of cases of sporotrichosis among HIV-infected patients was reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where an ongoing zoonotic outbreak was traced back to domestic cats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among the 21 cases described, disseminated sporotrichosis and lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis were noted in seven patients each. Five others had widespread cutaneous lesions, and two had fixed cutaneous lesions with no spread. Only two of the patients who had disseminated infection had meningitis. The mean CD4 count was 364 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microliter</span> (range 22 to 1100). Thus, there is likely a wider spectrum of infections in patients who have HIV infection than had been previously thought. This observation could be due to earlier diagnosis during an identified outbreak, or it is possible that a less virulent strain caused this outbreak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is not difficult when a patient presents with classic lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, since the clinical features are highly suggestive. However, diagnosis of the less classic forms of sporotrichosis, such as osteoarticular or visceral disease, is almost always delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture is the gold standard for establishing a diagnosis of sporotrichosis and is also the most sensitive method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Aspirated material from a lesion, sample from a tissue biopsy, sputum, or body fluids should be inoculated onto Sabouraud&rsquo;s dextrose agar and incubated at room temperature. Incubation at this temperature facilitates growth of the mycelial phase of <em>S. schenckii</em> with the characteristic arrangement of conidia on the hyphae.</p><p>Growth usually appears within five days, but sometimes can take several weeks. To ensure that the fungus is <em>S. schenckii</em>, the mold phase should be converted to the yeast phase on blood agar at 37&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rarely, <em>S. schenckii</em> has been grown from culture of blood using the lysis-centrifugation method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Increasingly, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) has been used to identify <em>Sporothrix</em> to the species level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual histopathologic picture is that of a mixed granulomatous and pyogenic process. The organisms may not be visualized even with special stains for fungi, such as Gomori methenamine silver and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stains, because the number of organisms is often small. When found, this fungus is 3 to 5 micron in diameter, oval to cigar-shaped, and may show multiple buds.</p><p>Rarely, asteroid bodies consisting of a central basophilic yeast surrounded by eosinophilic material radiating outward like spokes on a wheel, can be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73691\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73691 \">picture 5</a>).

As an example, a group from Brazil developed an enzyme immunoassay for serologic testing of <em>S. schenckii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a study evaluating this assay using serum samples collected over 10 years (177 from patients with sporotrichosis, 77 samples from patients with other fungal infections, 15 from patients with non-fungal diseases, and 38 healthy controls) the sensitivity and specificity were 89 and 82 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This study was performed in patients who acquired sporotrichosis in the outbreak of feline-associated sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro; whether it will prove as useful in other cases of sporotrichosis remains to be seen.
