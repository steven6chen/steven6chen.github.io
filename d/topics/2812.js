class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 147 million people, or 2.5 percent of the world population, use cannabis (marijuana), making it the world's most widely cultivated, trafficked, and abused illicit substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Use is high in the adolescent age group. As an example, among surveyed adolescents in the United States, approximately 7 percent of 8<sup>th</sup> graders, 15 percent of 10<sup>th</sup> graders, and 21 percent of 12<sup>th</sup> graders reported cannabis use in the past month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Several countries, including Canada, Switzerland, and the United States are contemplating or actually liberalizing laws governing cannabis use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At the United States federal level, cannabis products are classified as Schedule 1, ie, no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. However, over 20 states have decriminalized medical marijuana or are reviewing legislation to allow low-dose delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products for specific medicinal indications. Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska have allowed the retail sale and possession of recreational marijuana [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The public health impact of decriminalization or legalization of recreational cannabis use include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both decriminalization and legalized recreational use have been associated with increased unintentional pediatric ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. As an example, after legalization of recreational marijuana use in Colorado, annual calls to the regional poison control center for pediatric marijuana exposure increased 34 percent on average to 6 cases per 100,000 population, which was almost twice the rate for the rest of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Exposure to recreational marijuana accounted for about half of cases. Rates of hospital visits at a large regional children&rsquo;s hospital system also increased significantly during the period of the study, although the total number of presenting patients (81) was small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In regions with medical marijuana availability, diversion of drug from registered users may also encourage adolescent abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In other countries where cannabis can be used legally, rates of usage vary. For example, in the Netherlands, the overall annual prevalence of cannabis usage is 23 percent among young adults compared with 5 percent annual usage reported by persons 12 to 64 years of age in Uruguay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Thus, the impact of decriminalization or legalization on the subsequent prevalence of cannabis usage is not easily predicted and varies depending upon the specifics of regulatory enactment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455434637\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455434643\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cannabinoid receptor is a G-protein linked receptor, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase and stimulates potassium conductance. There are two known cannabinoid receptors: CB1 and CB2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CB1 is found in the central nervous system including the basal ganglia, substantia nigra, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. It acts presynaptically and inhibits release of several neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, L-glutamate, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CB2 is found peripherally in the immune system tissues (eg, splenic macrophages and B lymphocytes), peripheral nerve terminals, and vas deferens. It is postulated that it plays a role in regulation of immune responses and inflammatory reactions. Anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide are known endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455434649\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) vary by route of exposure as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/13,15-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inhaled marijuana</strong> &ndash; After inhalation of marijuana smoke, onset of psychoactive effects occurs rapidly with peak effects felt at 15 to 30 minutes and lasting up to four hours. These effects mirror plasma delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations. Approximately 2 to 3 mg of inhaled THC is sufficient to produce drug effects in a na&iuml;ve user. Pulmonary bioavailability varies from 10 to 35 percent of an inhaled dose and is determined by the depth of inhalation along with the duration of puffing and breathholding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ingested marijuana</strong> &ndash; When compared to inhalation, cannabis ingestion has a delayed onset of psychoactive effects that ranges from 30 minutes to three hours. Clinical effects may last up to 12 hours. Orally administered cannabis has low bioavailability (5 to 20 percent) because of chemical degradation in gastric acid and substantial first-pass metabolism in the liver. In na&iuml;ve users, psychotropic effects occur with 5 to 20 mg of ingested THC.</p><p/><p>THC is lipid soluble, highly protein-bound (95 to 99 percent), and has a volume of distribution of 2.5 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>].</p><p>THC metabolism occurs via hepatic cytochrome oxidases, CYP2C9 and 3A4. The primary active metabolite is 11-hydroxy THC, and the inactivated metabolite is THC-carboxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. THC crosses the placenta with fetal plasma concentrations 10 to 30 percent of maternal concentrations. It also accumulates in breast milk at a concentration as high as eight times maternal plasma concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>].</p><p>After metabolism, THC is mostly excreted as hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites via feces (65 percent) and urine (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although difficult to measure, the elimination half-life of THC is slow, ranging from 25 to 36 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This lengthy half-life is likely due to slow release from lipid storage compartments and enterohepatic circulation. Elimination half-life is longer in regular cannabis users.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2361926953\"><span class=\"h2\">Cannabis formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of subspecies and strains of cannabis (marijuana); <em>Cannabis sativa</em> is one of the most commonly used for recreational purposes. Cannabis sativa contains over 500 different clinical compounds, and over 60 known cannabinoids; of these, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most psychoactive and is responsible for most symptoms of intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>].</p><p>The dried flower of the marijuana plant has a large range of THC content, ranging from 1 to 20 percent of the total weight; however, much variability exists among marijuana samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In general, marijuana potency has increased over the past 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Common slang terms for marijuana include &quot;pot,&quot; &quot;grass,&quot; &quot;dope,&quot; &quot;MJ,&quot; &quot;Mary Jane,&quot; &quot;doobie,&quot; &quot;hooch,&quot; &quot;weed,&quot; &quot;hash,&quot; &quot;reefers,&quot; and &quot;ganja.&quot;</p><p>Chemical analogues of THC, called &quot;synthetic cannabinoids&quot; may have been available in Europe as early as 2004, and were first reported in the United States in December 2008. The clinical effects can be similar to natural marijuana intoxication, but may also result in more severe life-threatening symptoms. Acute intoxication from synthetic cannabinoids as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synthetic-cannabinoids-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synthetic cannabinoids: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371777890\"><span class=\"h3\">Recreational use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recreational marijuana use often consists of smoking the dried flower in the form of rolled cigarettes (joints) and water bongs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. THC is also extracted using various solvents (butane, ethanol, hexane, isopropanol) to create highly concentrated products (60 to 99 percent of weight) including oils and tinctures called &quot;wax,&quot; &quot;dabs,&quot; &quot;budder,&quot; and &quot;shatters&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition to being smoked, these highly concentrated products are also vaporized (eg, using electronic cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]) or mixed in food products (such as brownies, cakes, candies, and beverages) and ingested.</p><p>In regions where marijuana use is legal, ingested forms are popular and may pose a risk of unintentional ingestion by children or excessive ingestion by adults. As an example, in Colorado, some companies have produced packaging for marijuana products that mimic popular candy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Furthermore, many of these products contain up to four times the suggested dose of 10 mg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371777896\"><span class=\"h3\">Medicinal use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicinal marijuana is supplied as dried flowers of the <em>Cannabis sativa</em> plant that are smoked as described for recreational cannabis use (see <a href=\"#H2371777890\" class=\"local\">'Recreational use'</a> above). Derivatives of cannabinoids are also available as pharmaceuticals in some countries including oral preparations (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabilone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabilone</a>) and a spray for buccal use (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabiximols-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabiximols</a>).</p><p>Marijuana and its components have been proposed for various medicinal purposes, such as chronic severe pain (eg, due to cancer), refractory nausea and vomiting, anorexia and cachexia, glaucoma, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, none have been proven to have greater efficacy than other currently available medications.</p><p>Of these indications, medical marijuana is most frequently prescribed for severe or chronic pain. An oromucosal spray containing THC and cannabidiol (Sativex), also called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabiximols-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabiximols</a>, has been shown to have some efficacy as a multipurpose analgesic in combination with traditional therapy and is approved for use in Canada and elsewhere but not in the United States. No controlled studies demonstrate the efficacy of inhaled marijuana as an adjunct to traditional pain medications for patients with cancer-related pain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;, section on 'Cannabis and cannabinoids'</a>).

Psychosis has also been associated with use of higher <span class=\"nowrap\">potency/concentrated</span> marijuana products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>Toxicity in children is most often reported after ingestion of a highly concentrated food product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/7,8,42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,42-47</a>] or hashish resin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Estimated oral doses from 5 to 300 mg in pediatrics have caused a range of symptoms such as mild sleepiness, ataxia, behavior changes, excessive and purposeless motor activity of the extremities (hyperkinesis), coma, and respiratory depression with more severe intoxication correlated with higher estimated doses. For example, in a small cohort of 38 children presenting to an emergency department for acute marijuana intoxication after ingestion, degree of symptoms corresponded to an estimated dose as follows: 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of THC led to observation and minimal medical intervention, 7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of THC led to admission to an inpatient floor and moderate medical intervention, and 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of THC led to admission to an intensive care unit and major medical interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Patients without prior THC exposure more commonly had lethargy or somnolence and had a longer duration of clinical symptoms. Similarly, as concentrated hashish resin has become more available in France, a corresponding increase in the number and severity of annual admissions has occurred among infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455434667\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of acute cannabis (marijuana) intoxication vary according to age.</p><p>Neurologic abnormalities are more prominent in children and include ataxia, excessive and purposeless motor activity of the extremities (hyperkinesis), lethargy, and prolonged coma, which may be life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/7,8,42-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,42-48</a>].</p><p>Acute marijuana intoxication is an unusual primary complaint in adolescents and adults. Patients who come to medical attention are more likely to have hyperemesis or behavioral problems (eg, dysphoria or agitation) caused by adverse cannabis effects or medical emergencies (eg, bronchospasm or pneumothorax) associated with the method of inhalation. Chest pain with myocardial infarction in young adults without any prior history of coronary artery abnormalities has also been rarely described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. The issue of causation is unclear, however, in light of the frequency of cannabis use in the general population and the presence of unsuspected atherosclerosis or other cardiac condition in some of these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7890723\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, acute marijuana intoxication typically occurs after exploratory ingestion of marijuana intended for adult use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/7-9,43-47,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,43-47,54</a>].

Increased sociability usually occurs during intoxication, although dysphoric reactions may be accompanied by social withdrawal. Inexperienced users who ingest cannabis products may not be aware that effects may not be felt for up to three hours which may cause them to continue to consume high potency products with an increased likelihood of dysphoria. (See <a href=\"#H455434649\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Perceptual changes include the sensation that colors are brighter and music is more vivid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Time perception is distorted in that perceived time is faster than clock time. Spatial perception can also be distorted, and high doses of potent cannabis products may cause hallucinations. Mystical thinking, increased self-consciousness, and depersonalization may occur, as well as transient grandiosity, paranoia, and other signs of psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/16,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognition, psychomotor performance</strong> &ndash; Cannabis use decreases reaction time and impairs attention, concentration, short term memory, and risk assessment.

Acute cannabis use also impairs motor coordination and interferes with the ability to complete complex tasks that require divided attention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Impairment of cognition, coordination, and judgment lasts much longer than the subjective mood change of feeling &quot;high.&quot; Psychomotor impairment lasts for 12 to 24 hours due to accumulation of marijuana in adipose tissue, slow release of THC from fatty tissue stores, and enterohepatic recirculation. However, a marijuana user may think that he or she is no longer impaired several hours after the acute mood altering effects have resolved. As an example, a placebo controlled trial with licensed pilots found that smoking marijuana impaired performance on a flight simulator for up to 24 hours, although only one of the nine subjects possessed self-awareness of this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Acute psychomotor impairments interfere with the ability to operate other heavy machinery, such as automobiles, trains, and motorcycles.

Furthermore, the probability of causing an accident increases with plasma levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7892848\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug testing for cannabinoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospital testing for cannabis typically consists of urine drug screen. (See <a href=\"#H455434686\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Standard urine drug screens that are available in most healthcare facilities consist of immunoassays that detect delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) metabolites, primarily THC carboxylase. The lower limits of detection range from 20 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> depending upon the specific assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) standard is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> with confirmatory testing using 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> as the lower limits of detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>In situations where a positive screen for cannabis has legal implications or may impact school attendance or sports participation, individuals may claim that the test results from passive inhalation of marijuana smoked by others. In adolescents and adults, it is difficult to achieve sufficient concentrations from secondhand smoke from typical cannabis cigarettes to detect metabolite concentrations above most urine drug screen limits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/73-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-77</a>]. However, studies using products with higher THC content (typical of what is more commonly used since 2005) have not been performed. Also, the potential for second-hand cannabis exposure to cause a positive screen in children has not been studied.</p><p>False positives for cannabinoids are rare, because the chemical structure is unique and immunoassays are targeted toward metabolites of THC. Reported false positives for THC include: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, proton pump inhibitors, hemp seed oil, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and baby wash products in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/78-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-83</a>]. However, most package inserts for commercially available immunoassays will list possible false positives for their cannabinoid assay. If required for clinical or social indications, confirmatory testing of urine, blood or serum can be sent to reference labs by gas chromatography and mass spectrophotometry.

Patients with chest pain suggestive of myocardial ischemia or infarction warrant a 12-lead electrocardiogram and possibly cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin T or I).

However, patients with signs of a tension pneumothorax should undergo decompression prior to chest radiography. Bedside ultrasound may assist with rapid diagnosis of pneumothorax in these unstable patients.

Neuroimaging should be avoided in known cannabis exposures unless focal neurologic findings are also present or concerns for other etiologies such as head trauma exist.

However, diagnosis in the pediatric population can be difficult because a history of exposure is often lacking and the symptoms of marijuana exposure are nonspecific. Thus, urine drug screens can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis because any positive result in children identifies acute exposure. (See <a href=\"#H7892848\" class=\"local\">'Drug testing for cannabinoids'</a> above.)</p><p>Urine drug screens are less helpful in adolescents and adults for the diagnosis of acute intoxication. Although testing is usually positive several hours after acute exposure it can also be positive well after symptoms have resolved. As an example, positive results for delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites have been reported up to 10 days after weekly use and up to 25 days for after daily use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

After ingestion, most symptoms are delayed up to three hours, which limits the efficacy of AC. Also, the clinical effects of cannabis ingestion are often limited and good outcomes occur with supportive care alone.

Acute treatment consists of symptomatic care including intravenous fluid hydration, antiemetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>), and benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Cessation of marijuana use is also recommended. </p><p>Limited observational evidence (case reports and case series) also suggests that topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> cream (supplied in concentrations of 0.025 to 0.1 percent) applied once in a thin film over the abdomen may improve acute severe abdominal pain and emesis in patients not responsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> or benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-marijuana-acute-intoxication/abstract/86-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-89</a>].

Exploratory ingestions of marijuana products have been described in young children and are more frequent in regions with decriminalization or legalization of cannabis use. Less commonly, intentional exposure of children by caretakers, including encouragement of cannabis inhalation to promote sleepiness and to decrease activity, has been reported. (See <a href=\"#H455434631\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7890723\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In young children, ingestion of cannabis (marijuana) may cause life-threatening coma with apnea or depressed respirations. Seizures have also been reported. Other features following limited pediatric exposures include behavioral changes, lethargy, and physiologic effects of intoxication as seen in adolescents and adults. (See <a href=\"#H7890723\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children may warrant testing for other potential causes of altered mental status depending upon whether the exposure is known and based upon specific physical findings. (See <a href=\"#H7894493\" class=\"local\">'Other ancillary studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H455434692\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The findings of cannabis intoxication in adolescents and adults include tachycardia, blood pressure changes (hypertension, or in the elderly, orthostatic hypotension), conjunctival injection, dry mouth, increased appetite, nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, euphoria, perceptual changes, and psychomotor impairment. (See <a href=\"#H7890730\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents and adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain in adolescents and adults who use cannabis recreationally may arise from a pneumothorax, exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease such as asthma, or, rarely, myocardial ischemia or infarction. (See <a href=\"#H7890730\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents and adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adolescents and adults, no specific testing is necessary. Investigation for other intoxicants may be indicated if symptoms are prolonged, or if other marked physiologic abnormalities exist such as hyperthermia, acidosis, significant rhabdomyolysis, or end-organ toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H455434705\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents and adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of age, acute cannabis intoxication is a clinical diagnosis. Urine drug screens can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in young children because any positive result identifies acute exposure. Urine drug screens are less helpful in adolescents and adults and are not routinely needed for diagnosis or management. (See <a href=\"#H455434686\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7892848\" class=\"local\">'Drug testing for cannabinoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of young children with ingestion of cannabis (marijuana) consists of exclusion of hypoglycemia in patients with altered mental status and supportive care of coma. Excessive muscle activity (hyperkinesis) should be initially treated with benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>). (See <a href=\"#H455434744\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most adolescents and adults presenting for treatment of acute cannabis intoxication have mild intoxication with dysphoria that can be managed with a dimly lit room, reassurance, decreased stimulation, and, in some patients, benzodiazepines (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2437113\" class=\"local\">'Mild intoxication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain in association with cannabis use should be managed according to the underlying etiology (eg, acute coronary syndrome, pneumothorax, or asthma exacerbation).
