The acute management differs. Immediate goals include minimizing brain injury, treating medical complications, and moving toward uncovering the pathophysiologic basis of the patient's symptoms.</p><p>Patient assessment and management during the acute phase (first few hours) of an ischemic stroke will be reviewed here. Use of thrombolytic therapy, treatment of patients not eligible for thrombolytic therapy, the clinical diagnosis of various types of stroke, and the subacute and long-term assessment of patients who have had a stroke are discussed separately.

However, patients with conditions other than brain ischemia may present in a similar fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69869 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, patients suffering a stroke may present with other serious medical conditions. Thus, the initial evaluation requires a rapid but broad assessment.</p><p>The goals in the initial phase include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensuring medical stability, with particular attention to airway, breathing, and circulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quickly reversing any conditions that are contributing to the patient's problem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining if patients with acute ischemic stroke are candidates for intravenous thrombolytic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 2</a>) or endovascular thrombectomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moving toward uncovering the pathophysiologic basis of the patient's neurologic symptoms</p><p/><p>Time is of the essence in the hyperacute evaluation of stroke patients. The history, physical examination, serum glucose, oxygen saturation, and a noncontrast CT scan are sufficient in most cases to guide acute therapy (see <a href=\"#H95644450\" class=\"local\">'Immediate laboratory studies'</a> below). Other tests are considered based upon individual patient characteristics, but the absence or unavailability of any additional tests need not be a reason to delay therapy if otherwise indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66230911\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway, breathing and circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessing vital signs and ensuring stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation is part of the initial evaluation of all patients with critical illness, including those with stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with decreased consciousness or bulbar dysfunction may be unable to protect their airway, and those with increased intracranial pressure due to hemorrhage, vertebrobasilar ischemia, or bihemispheric ischemia can present with vomiting, decreased respiratory drive, or muscular airway obstruction. Hypoventilation, with a resulting increase in carbon dioxide, may lead to cerebral vasodilation and elevate intracranial pressure.</p><p>In these cases, intubation may be necessary to restore adequate ventilation and to protect the airway from aspiration. Patients with adequate ventilation should have the oxygen saturation monitored. Patients who are hypoxic should receive supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation &gt;94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Supplemental oxygen should not routinely be given to nonhypoxic patients with acute ischemic stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing the time of ischemic stroke symptom onset is critical because it is the main determinant of eligibility for treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 2</a>) and endovascular thrombectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For patients who are unable to provide a reliable onset time, symptom onset is defined as the time the patient was last known to be normal or at baseline neurologic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For patients presenting within the therapeutic window for thrombolysis (less than 4.5 hours from symptom onset) or endovascular thrombectomy (less than 6 hours from symptom onset), the history needs to be accurate but rapid; contraindications to thrombolytic treatment should also be assessed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke#H3301330430\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'Rapid evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The history and physical examination should be used to distinguish between other disorders in the differential diagnosis of brain ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69869 \">table 1</a>). As examples, seizures, syncope, migraine, hypoglycemia (see <a href=\"#H100191313\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> below), hyperglycemia, or drug toxicity can mimic acute ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most difficult cases involve patients with the combination of focal signs and altered level of consciousness. It is important to ask the patient, relative, or any reliable informant whether the patient takes insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, has a history of epilepsy, drug overdose or abuse, or recent trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosing an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as soon as possible can be lifesaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The history may be helpful in this regard. The presence of onset headache and vomiting favor the diagnosis of ICH or SAH compared with a thromboembolic stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60831 \">figure 1</a>), while the abrupt onset of impaired cerebral function without focal symptoms favors the diagnosis of SAH. Another important element of the history is whether the patient takes anticoagulant drugs. Even with these clues, diagnosing intracranial hemorrhage on clinical grounds is very imprecise, so early neuroimaging with a CT or MRI scan is critical. CT is preferred at most centers, as it can be obtained very rapidly and is effective at distinguishing between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>). It is important to assess and stabilize vital physiologic functions <strong>before</strong> sending the patient for an imaging study.</p><p>The physical examination should include careful evaluation of the neck and retroorbital regions for vascular bruits, and palpation of pulses in the neck, arms, and legs to assess for their absence, asymmetry, or irregular rate. The heart should be auscultated for murmurs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>). The lungs should be assessed for abnormal breath sounds, bronchospasm, fluid overload, or stridor.</p><p>The skin should be examined for signs of endocarditis, cholesterol emboli, purpura, ecchymoses, or evidence of recent surgery or other invasive procedures, particularly if reliable history is not forthcoming. The funduscopic examination may be helpful if there are cholesterol emboli or papilledema. The head should be examined for signs of trauma. A tongue laceration may suggest a seizure.</p><p>In cases where there is a report or suspicion of a fall, the neck should be immobilized until evaluated radiographically for evidence of serious trauma. Examination of the extremities is important to look for evidence of systemic arterial emboli, distal ischemic, cellulitis, and deep vein thrombosis; the latter should raise the possibility that the patient is receiving anticoagulant treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95636670\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemia in different vascular territories presents with specific syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75487\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75487 \">table 3</a>). The history should focus upon the time of symptom onset, the course of symptoms over time, possible embolic sources, items in the differential diagnosis, and concomitant diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The neurologic examination should attempt to confirm the findings from the history and provide a quantifiable examination for further assessment over time. Many scales are available that provide a structured, quantifiable neurologic examination. One of the most widely used and validated scales is the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), composed of 11 items (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61698 \">table 4</a>) adding up to a total score of 0 to 42 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-national-institutes-of-health-stroke-scale-nihss-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>); defined cutpoints for mild, moderate, and severe stroke are not well established, but cut-points of NIHSS score &lt;5 for mild, 5 to 9 for moderate, and &ge;10 for severe stroke may be reasonable.</p><p>The three most predictive examination findings for the diagnosis of acute stroke are facial paresis, arm <span class=\"nowrap\">drift/weakness,</span> and abnormal speech (a combination of dysarthria and language items derived from the NIHSS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The NIHSS score on admission has been correlated to stroke outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81859 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and its use is recommended for all patients with suspected stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95644450\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urgent brain imaging with CT or MRI is mandatory in all patients with sudden neurologic deterioration or acute stroke.

Some advanced CT and MRI technologies may be able to distinguish between brain tissue that is irreversibly infarcted and that which is potentially salvageable, thereby allowing better selection of patients who are likely to benefit from therapy. This topic is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95646729\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrocardiography (ECG) is important for detecting signs of concomitant acute cardiac ischemia. This test is particularly important in the setting of stroke, as patients with ischemic stroke frequently harbor coronary artery disease but may not be able to report chest pain.</p><p>Stroke alone can be associated with ECG changes. The sympathetic response to stroke can lead to demand-induced myocardial ischemia. In large strokes, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage, there are centrally mediated changes in the ECG.</p><p>The ECG and cardiac monitoring are important for the detection of chronic or intermittent arrhythmias that predispose to embolic events (eg, atrial fibrillation) and for detecting indirect evidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">atrial/ventricular</span> enlargement that may predispose to thrombus formation. Current guidelines recommend cardiac monitoring for at least the first 24 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke to look for atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, paroxysmal AF may be undetected on standard cardiac monitoring such as continuous telemetry and 24- or 48-hour Holter monitors. Extended cardiac event monitoring for patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who present with sinus rhythm can significantly increase the detection of occult AF. Such monitoring may reduce in the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke by prompting the appropriate use of long-term anticoagulation. The optimal monitoring method &ndash; continuous telemetry, ambulatory electrocardiography, serial electrocardiography, transtelephonic ECG monitoring, or implantable loop recorders &ndash; is uncertain, though longer durations of monitoring are likely to obtain the highest diagnostic yield. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke#H24817210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Long-term therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography adequately detect cardiogenic and aortic sources for cerebral embolism other than atrial fibrillation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography in detection of cardiac and aortic sources of systemic embolism&quot;</a>). However, their use can be postponed to later in the hospitalization, when the patient is in a more stable clinical condition. Exceptions include patients with a moderate or high suspicion of endocarditis, where echocardiography may provide confirmation of the diagnosis.

Care in a dedicated stroke unit (see <a href=\"#H68922375\" class=\"local\">'Stroke unit care'</a> below) is associated with better outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56228155\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravascular volume depletion is frequent in the setting of acute stroke, particularly in older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and may worsen cerebral blood flow. For most patients with acute stroke and volume depletion, isotonic saline without dextrose is the agent of choice for intravascular fluid repletion and maintenance fluid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In general, it is best to avoid excess free water (eg, as in &frac12; isotonic saline) because hypotonic fluids may exacerbate cerebral edema in acute stroke and are less useful than isotonic solutions for replacing intravascular volume. In addition, it is best to avoid fluids containing glucose, which may exacerbate hyperglycemia. However, fluid management must be individualized on the basis of cardiovascular status, electrolyte disturbances, and other conditions that may perturb fluid balance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In particular, hyponatremia following subarachnoid hemorrhage may be due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or rarely, to cerebral salt-wasting; these are physiologically distinct and are treated differently, as discussed separately.

However, the currently available evidence suggests that it does not. A 2014 systematic review identified 11 controlled trials involving nearly over 1500 adults with acute ischemic stroke who were randomly assigned to either intensively monitored insulin infusion therapy or to usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

It is important to assess swallowing function prior to administering oral medications or food. Thus, prevention of aspiration in patients with acute stroke includes initial nulla per os (NPO) status until swallowing function is evaluated.

As an example, in a study involving 20 patients with moderately severe ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, mean flow velocity in the MCA measured by transcranial Doppler increased by an average of 20 percent when the head-of-bed elevation decreased from 30 to 0 degrees, and by an average of 12 percent when head-of-bed elevation decreased from 30 to 15 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Furthermore, some patients with acute ischemic stroke may develop increased ischemic symptoms upon standing, sitting, or elevating the head of the bed, due to reduction in flow through stenotic vessels or collateral pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Thus, some stroke experts have favored a supine position is preferred for nonhypoxic patients with acute ischemic stroke who are able to tolerate lying flat. When done, keeping the patient flat is a temporary measure that should be discontinued in most patients after 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>Nevertheless, the benefit of maintaining the head flat in this setting remains unproven. In the HeadPoST controlled trial of over 11,000 subjects with acute stroke (85 percent ischemic) who were randomly assigned to either a lying-flat position or a sitting-up position with the head elevated to at least 30 degrees, there was no difference between treatment groups in disability outcomes, mortality, or serious adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Mobilization of stable patients after 24 hours may lessen the likelihood of major complications such as pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and pressure sores after stroke.

The multicenter randomized AVERT trial, with over 2000 patients, evaluated a protocol of very early mobilization, which was started within 24 hours of stroke onset and consisted of frequent out-of-bed activity including sitting, standing, and walking. Compared with usual care, very early mobilization and early rehabilitative therapies reduced the odds of a favorable outcome at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever has special significance in patients presenting with acute neurologic deterioration.
