An individualized risk-benefit assessment of SAVR versus TAVI is performed in the following clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with high surgical risk who are not candidates for transfemoral TAVI, an individualized risk-benefit analysis is performed comparing SAVR and alternative access TAVI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with intermediate surgical risk who are candidates for transfemoral TAVI, an individualized risk-benefit analysis is performed comparing transfemoral TAVI versus SAVR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with low surgical risk who have a relative contraindications for SAVR, an individualized risk-benefit analysis is performed comparing off-label TAVI versus SAVR. Transfemoral TAVI when feasible is preferred to alternative access TAVI.</p><p/><p>A key issue influencing the choice of TAVI versus SAVR is lack of data on very long-term outcomes with TAVI. Clinical factors influencing the choice between TAVI and SAVR include the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences, age, estimated life expectancy with AVR, as well as presence of concurrent conditions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that favor SAVR include presence of another indication for cardiac surgery (eg, need for coronary artery bypass graft or mitral valve surgery), patient age &lt;75 years old, patient characteristics favoring mechanical valve replacement (eg, age &lt;65 with long life-expectancy, and absence of contraindications for anticoagulation), as well as anatomic risk factors such as severe left ventricular outflow calcification or severely calcified bicuspid valve. Mechanical valves can be implanted only surgically. Factors that favor mechanical valve replacement include age &lt;65, long life-expectancy, and absence of contraindication for anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement#H581209619\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of prosthetic heart valve for surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement&quot;, section on 'Recommendations for valve choice'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that favor TAVI include patient age &ge;75 years and presence of risk factors for SAVR (such as frailty, prior mediastinal irradiation, or cirrhosis) not captured by the STS-PROM score. As discussed above, for patients with high surgical risk (STS-PROM score &gt;8 but &lt; 50 percent probability of death), the feasibility of transfemoral TAVI is a major factor favoring proceeding with TAVI. The feasibility of TAVI is also a factor favoring TAVI in patients with intermediate surgical risk (STS-PROM score 4 to 8).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although women experience more major bleeding and vascular complications with TAVI, female sex is an independent predictor of lower mortality after TAVI compared with women undergoing surgery (as well as compared with men undergoing TAVI). Thus, sex-specific mortality risk following TAVI is opposite of that following SAVR, for which women have higher mortality risk than men. We suggest including female sex as a factor since a mortality benefit has been observed with TAVI versus SAVR among women with intermediate to high surgical risk. (See <a href=\"#H2285453006\" class=\"local\">'Sex-specific differences in outcomes'</a> below.) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2867775532\"><span class=\"h2\">Access site for TAVI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As TAVI technology has evolved, nearly all (&gt;95 percent) of cases can be performed via transfemoral access; alternative (nontransfemoral) sites are predominantly subclavian or direct aortic, transapical, and least commonly transcarotid. When transfemoral access for TAVI is feasible, it is preferred to alternative access, since there is greater experience with transfemoral access and reported outcomes are superior with transfemoral access. Furthermore, the benefits of TAVI over surgery in the PARTNER 2 Trial and United States Pivotal Trial were greatest in the transfemoral cohorts. However, it is unclear how much of the excess mortality seen in patients undergoing alternative access TAVI is caused by the alternative access procedure per se and how much is caused by excess risk associated with the burden of peripheral vascular disease, mandating the need for alternative access. (See <a href=\"#H983814353\" class=\"local\">'By access site'</a> below.)</p><p>Preprocedural assessment for TAVI includes assessment of the iliofemoral system and aorta, generally by multidetector computed tomography with optional invasive angiography to detect contraindications to vascular (transfemoral, subclavian, or aortic) access such as plaques with mobile thrombi in the ascending aorta or arch, or inadequate vessel size or extensive calcification or tortuosity. For the transapical approach, severe pulmonary disease, severe left ventricular disease, or other conditions may render the left ventricular apex inaccessible. Extensive ascending aortic calcification is an infrequent contraindication to the direct aortic approach, as a soft spot for catheter entry can usually be found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389533305\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3853132591\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimation of risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operative risk assessment (including identification of high and prohibitive risk) includes consideration of estimated operative mortality, frailty, compromised major organ system, and comorbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95631 \">table 1</a>).

The composite primary outcome (death from any cause, stroke, or myocardial infarction at one year) and its components were similar in the two groups (13.1 versus 16.3 percent for the composite outcome). TAVI patients had larger improvements in effective orifice area but more frequently required pacemaker implantation, had more aortic valve regurgitation, and worse New York Heart Association functional class at one year.

However, the available data are not adequate to determine how much of the excess mortality seen in patients undergoing alternative access TAVI is caused by the alternative access procedure and how much is caused by excess comorbidity associated with the need for alternative access. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3164570109\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon-expandable versus self-expanding valves for aortic stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data directly comparing clinical outcomes in patients with AS treated with balloon-expandable versus self-expanding valves are limited and a direct comparison of long-term clinical outcomes is not available.</p><p>The randomized CHOICE trial in 241 high-risk patients with AS found that procedural success was more frequent with a balloon-expandable Edwards SAPIEN XT valve compared with a self-expanding CoreValve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-therapy-for-symptomatic-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] but one-year clinical outcomes were not significantly different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-therapy-for-symptomatic-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Thus, sex-specific mortality risk following TAVI is opposite of that following SAVR, for which women have higher mortality risk than men. We suggest including female sex as a factor when weighing the potential risks and benefits of TAVI versus SAVR, since the data suggest that TAVI as superior to SAVR for women with high-risk symptomatic AS. &#160; &#160; &#160; </p><p>In the above described four trial meta-analysis with predominantly intermediate- to high-risk patients, there was a borderline significant interaction for sex (p = 0.05), with a significant mortality reduction with TAVI versus SAVR among women (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50-0.91) but not among men (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77-1.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-therapy-for-symptomatic-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A patient-level meta-analysis that included five studies with a total of 11,310 patients evaluated sex-specific outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-therapy-for-symptomatic-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Following TAVI, women had higher rates of major vascular complications, major bleeding events, and stroke but a lower rate of moderate or greater aortic regurgitation. Thirty-day mortality rates were similar in women and men (6.5 percent for both) but female sex was an independent predictor of reduced mortality at follow-up at a median of 387 days (adjusted HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.73-0.86). </p><p>The largest single study of sex-specific outcomes included 2559 high-risk and inoperable patients with AS undergoing TAVI in the randomized and nonrandomized portions of the PARTNER trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-therapy-for-symptomatic-severe-aortic-stenosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Thirty-day mortality rates were similar in women and men (6.5 versus 5.9 percent) but the one-year mortality rate was significantly lower in women (19 versus 24.9 percent).

SAVR or TAVI are not indicated in patients with comorbidities that would preclude an expected benefit from correction of AS. (See <a href=\"#H542516773\" class=\"local\">'Approach to choosing therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multidisciplinary heart valve team (including cardiologists, structural valve interventionalists, cardiovascular surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses) should collaborate to optimize care for patients with symptomatic severe AS. The heart valve team should assess an individual patient&rsquo;s life expectancy, frailty, comorbidities, specific anatomy, values, and preferences.

In patients with a relative contraindication to SAVR not captured by STS-PROM, an individualized risk-benefit assessment of SAVR versus alternate access TAVI is performed.

A key issue influencing the choice of TAVI versus SAVR is lack of data on very long-term outcomes with TAVI. Clinical factors influencing the choice between TAVI and SAVR include the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences, age, estimated life expectancy with AVR, as well as presence of concurrent conditions. Factors favoring SAVR include other indications for surgery, lack of femoral access, and younger age (longer life expectancy), while factors favoring TAVI include relative contraindications for surgery and older age (shorter life expectancy).
