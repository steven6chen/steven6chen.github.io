Preparation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, the procedure itself, postoperative management, and outcomes following pulmonary thromboendarterectomy are reviewed here. The general approach to the treatment of CTEPH is described separately.

The decision to proceed to pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is based upon four criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgical accessibility of the thrombi</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence and severity of the hemodynamic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventilatory impairment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of the patient's comorbidities on the risks of the surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The willingness and motivation of the patient to undergo surgery</p><p/><p>Evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension#H19764309\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy'</a>.)</p><p>The decision to proceed to surgery is a complex one, best undertaken at a center experienced in the care of these patients. The decision is based on the location and extent of chronic thromboembolic obstruction, the associated hemodynamic impairment, and comorbidities that might contribute to risk. Advanced parenchymal lung disease, either obstructive or restrictive, represents an absolute contraindication in that reperfusion of abnormal pulmonary parenchyma will result in minimal symptomatic improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine placement of IVC filters prior to thromboendarterectomy is a subject of some controversy. In centers which do so, it is routinely placed prior to surgery, unless an obvious non-leg or non-pelvic source was the cause of the pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is generally done several days prior to surgery, in order to avoid bleeding complications at the insertion site during the perioperative period. Percutaneous transjugular vein insertion is preferred. The purpose of inferior vena caval filter insertion is to protect patients from recurrent pulmonary emboli both during the high-risk perioperative period and over the long-term, in the event that thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulant therapy has to be discontinued due to bleeding complications or the need for other surgical procedures.</p><p>Coronary angiography is routinely performed prior to surgery in patients who are at risk for coronary artery disease. This is usually done at the same time as right heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography. Coronary artery bypass grafting can be performed during the same operation as the pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy involves median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and periods of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/1,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-9</a>]. The median sternotomy allows access to the pulmonary arteries, assures more complete removal of the chronically obstructing material, and decreases the likelihood that bronchial artery collateral flow will be disrupted. Dissection of the pulmonary arteries takes place intrapericardially, and neither pleural cavity is entered. Cardiopulmonary bypass with periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest provides the bloodless operative field essential for meticulous lobar and segmental dissections.</p><p>Periods of circulatory arrest are limited to 20-minute intervals (an entire unilateral endarterectomy can usually be accomplished within this time by an experienced surgeon). After each period of circulatory arrest, reperfusion is carried out until either the pulmonary venous saturations reach 90 percent or at least 10 minutes have passed. At the completion of the bilateral pulmonary endarterectomy, circulation is reestablished and the patient is rewarmed. The atrial septum is routinely inspected, since an atrial septal defect or persistent foramen ovale is identified and repaired in approximately 25 percent of cases. Additional procedures, such as coronary bypass grafting or valve replacement, are performed during the rewarming period if they are required.</p><p>Several alternative techniques have been explored in an effort to reduce the neurological complications of hypothermia and circulatory arrest, but none has proven superior to the traditional technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The alternative techniques include the use of moderate rather than deep hypothermia, aortic bronchial artery occlusion with a balloon catheter, antegrade cerebral artery perfusion with and without total circulatory arrest, and the application of negative pressure in the left ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>It should be emphasized that pulmonary thromboendarterectomy bears no resemblance to acute pulmonary embolectomy. The neointima in chronic thromboembolic disease is not easily recognizable as chronic thromboemboli and, thus, a true endarterectomy is necessary to restore pulmonary arterial patency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78850\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78850 \">picture 1</a>). This requires careful dissection of chronic endothelialized material from the native intima. There are several levels within the vessel where an endarterectomy plane can be established, but only one will strip easily away from the underlying media. Establishing the correct plane is essential. A plane that is too deep will result in perforation of the vessel, while a plane that is too superficial will not result in an adequate endarterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vigilant postoperative monitoring and management is necessary because the postoperative course can be complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Early management should focus on minimizing systemic oxygen consumption, optimizing right ventricular preload, and providing inotropic support.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4793743\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are maintained on lifelong anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This therapy is held preoperatively and then resumed postoperatively. For the majority of patients, thromboprophylaxis (eg, subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> [UFH] at 5000 units every 8 to 12 hours) is initiated on the evening of the surgical procedure, once the mediastinal output has decreased to approximately 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hr</span>. However, for those patients who are at particularly high risk for thromboembolic recurrence (eg, patients with a lupus anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibody), full dose anticoagulation using intravenous UFH is initiated with the goal aPTT in a low therapeutic range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4793786\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who undergo pulmonary thromboendarterectomy may experience complications that are common to other types of cardiothoracic surgery (eg, arrhythmias, atelectasis, wound infection, pericardial effusions, and delirium). They may also experience two unique complications that can significantly impair gas exchange: pulmonary artery steal and reperfusion pulmonary edema (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of postoperative pulmonary complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664046\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary artery steal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary artery steal, which occurs in approximately 70 percent of patients undergoing thromboendarterectomy, refers to the postoperative redistribution of pulmonary arterial blood flow from well perfused segments into the newly endarterectomized segments, with subsequent ventilation-perfusion mismatching and hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although incompletely understood, this is probably related to differential resistances within the pulmonary vascular bed following thromboendarterectomy. Treatment is supportive (ie, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation). Pulmonary vascular steal resolves in most patients, with supplemental oxygen no longer required within two weeks of hospital discharge in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Reperfusion pulmonary edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reperfusion pulmonary edema (RPE), which occurs in approximately 30 percent of patients undergoing thromboendarterectomy, is a type of high-permeability (ie, non-cardiogenic) pulmonary edema that typically occurs in areas of the lung from which proximal thromboemboli were removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It may appear up to 72 hours after surgery and varies in severity. Its manifestations range from mild postoperative hypoxemia to acute, hemorrhagic pulmonary edema resulting in death. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be required in patients in whom optimal medical management (diuresis, lung protective ventilator strategy) is insufficient to provide adequate oxygenation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Predicting which patients will develop RPE is difficult. The Pulmonary Edema Predictive Scoring Index (PEPSI) was reported in one study in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal pulmonary angioplasty (PTPA) as therapy for CTEPH. PEPSI is a measure of the change in pulmonary arterial blood flow before and after PTPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A higher PEPSI score (cut-off value of 35.4) was associated with a higher risk of RPE. PEPSI requires greater validation before it can be used to predict the risk of RPE, post PTPA or post-surgical thromboendarterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension#H8494452\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension&quot;, section on 'Percutaneous pulmonary balloon angioplasty'</a>.)</p><p>Management of reperfusion edema following pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is supportive (ie, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and occasionally anticoagulation), although case reports and a small case series suggest that inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/18,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20-22</a>]. It is hypothesized that the inhaled nitric oxide vasodilates the blood vessels that perfuse the well-ventilated alveoli, thereby redirecting blood flow to the well perfused alveoli, improving ventilation-perfusion matching, and reducing the severity of hypoxemia. The median ICU length of stay is four days, with a postoperative length of stay of 14 days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults&quot;, section on 'Management of hypoxemia'</a>.)</p><p>Reperfusion pulmonary edema and pulmonary artery steal can occur together. In this situation, the hypoxemia may be particularly profound because pulmonary blood flow is directed towards edematous, noncompliant areas of lung that contribute poorly to gas-exchange. (See <a href=\"#H1664046\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary artery steal'</a> above.)</p><p>Low tidal volume ventilation does not appear to reduce the incidence of reperfusion lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3756882\"><span class=\"h2\">Residual pulmonary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Residual pulmonary hypertension with persistent functional impairment may be an indication for medical therapy, as discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The morbidity and mortality of the second surgery is comparable to the primary procedure, but the improvement in hemodynamics is typically less impressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Perioperative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative mortality among patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PEA) for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) has decreased according to several observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. In a study of 500 such patients, perioperative mortality was 16 percent before 1990, 7 percent between 1990 and 1999, and 4 percent between 1998 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A subsequent study from an international registry reported an in-hospital postoperative mortality rate of 4.7 percent between 2007 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Another study reported in-hospital mortality rates as low as 2.5 percent between 2011 and 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Among low risk patients, a perioperative mortality rate of only 1.3 percent has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Reperfusion pulmonary edema and right ventricular failure due to residual pulmonary hypertension are the most common causes of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cardiac arrest, multiorgan failure, uncontrollable mediastinal bleeding, sepsis syndrome, and massive pulmonary hemorrhage also occur.</p><p>Hemodynamic improvement may be dramatic and immediate following thromboendarterectomy, with marked reductions in pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81069 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/1,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29-31</a>]. In one study, the mean reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance was nearly 70 percent and a pulmonary vascular resistance in the range of 200 to 350 dyne <span class=\"nowrap\">seconds/cm<sup>5</sup></span> was frequently achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The hemodynamic improvement is associated with improvement of symptoms and physical signs. Echocardiography demonstrates a decrease in right atrial and right ventricular chamber size, normalization of the interventricular septum, and decrease or resolution of tricuspid regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival &ndash; Mortality due to CTEPH is low among patients who survive three months post-thromboendarterectomy. In an observational study that followed 137 such survivors, only six patients (4 percent) died from CTEPH-related causes during the four year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A similar study demonstrated one- and three-year mortality rates of 1 and 6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study of 880 patients who underwent PEA, the overall survival was 86 percent at one year, 84 percent at three years, 79 percent at five years, and 72 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Few deaths were due to right heart failure; however, a mean pulmonary artery pressure &ge;38 mmHg was associated with worse survival. Similarly, another study of 239 patients reported 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival as 84, 77, and 62 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent thromboembolism &ndash; Less than 0.5 percent of all patients who have undergone a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy develop recurrent thromboembolic disease that requires a repeat pulmonary thromboendarterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Many of the individuals who develop recurrent thromboembolic disease have had inadequate management of their anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> had not undergone placement of an inferior vena cava filter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamics and symptoms &ndash; Hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement generally persist following surgery according to studies that have followed patients for up to 12 months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60924\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60924 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Long-term improvement is likely multifactorial: reduced right ventricular afterload due to improvement of the pulmonary hypertension, resolution of postoperative anemia and deconditioning, and improved ventilation-perfusion matching as postoperative pulmonary artery steal resolves. Most patients are New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class III or IV preoperatively and improve to NYHA Class I or II postoperatively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52486\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52486 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 4</a>). Many patients will resume normal activity, including employment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygenation and cardiac performance &ndash; Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy also appears to have a lasting impact on peripheral oxygen extraction and cardiac performance. This was demonstrated by a study in which serial cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed on 20 patients who had undergone pulmonary thromboendarterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Two distinct changes were noted. First, there was ongoing improvement of peak oxygen uptake. Second, ventilatory efficiency and exercise capacity improved, reaching a plateau one to six months after surgery. The increased ventilatory efficiency was a consequence of a decreased dead space to tidal volume ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(Vd/Vt),</span> during exercise. While improvement of the ventilatory efficiency correlated with the acute decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), improvement of the exercise capacity did not. The reasons for this are unknown. However, the results of another study suggested that improved exercise tolerance after surgery is associated with restoration of the stroke volume index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. General principles of cardiopulmonary exercise testing are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional exercise testing: Ventilatory gas analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual pulmonary hypertension &ndash; Persistent pulmonary hypertension occurs in 5 to 35 percent of patients who undergo pulmonary thromboendarterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/24,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,42-44</a>], likely due to unanticipated distal (ie, surgically inaccessible) thromboemboli or irreversible vasculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The variation of the estimates likely reflects the use of different definitions of persistent pulmonary hypertension. It is possible for patients with persistent pulmonary hypertension to achieve functional improvement and a survival equivalent to those who do not have persistent pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This may indicate that it is the size of the reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance that matters, rather than the final pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4793786\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The beneficial effects of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy may be immediate, dramatic, and sustained. These include improved exercise capacity, decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, and, probably, decreased mortality.
