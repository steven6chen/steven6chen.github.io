This topic will review the basic aspects of this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-approach-to-delayed-intraventricular-conduction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. More complete discussions of left and right bundle branch block are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-bundle-branch-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left bundle branch block&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-bundle-branch-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right bundle branch block&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-intraventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Intraventricular block&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Normal ventricular depolarization occurs after an impulse traverses the atrioventricular (AV) node and the bundle of His. This bundle of specialized conducting tissue splits into two main branches, the right and the left bundles, that rapidly transmit depolarization impulses to the right and left ventricular myocardium, respectively, via the Purkinje fibers. The main left bundle bifurcates into two primary subdivisions: a left anterior fascicle and a left posterior fascicle. Some patients have a third subdivision, a median fascicle. The depolarization wavefronts spread through the ventricular wall, from endocardium (inner layer) to epicardium (outer layer), triggering intracellular calcium release and myofilament contraction (electromechanical coupling).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RIGHT AND LEFT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right and left bundle branch blocks usually reflect intrinsic impairment of conduction in either the right or left bundle system, respectively (intraventricular conduction disturbances). Bundle branch block can be chronic or intermittent. As an example, transient rate-related bundle branch blocks do not uncommonly occur when the heart rate exceeds some critical value (tachycardia- or acceleration-dependent). Bradycardia or deceleration-dependent bundle branch blocks, in which conduction delay occurs when the rate falls below a certain level, are relatively rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiographic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bundle branch block leads to prolongation of the QRS interval and sometimes to alterations in the QRS vector. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-electrocardiographic-interpretation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of electrocardiographic interpretation&quot;</a>.) The degree of prolongation of the QRS interval depends upon the severity of the impairment. With complete bundle branch blocks, the QRS interval is classically stated to be greater than or equal to 120 ms (0.12 sec) in duration (three small boxes on electrocardiogram [ECG] paper); with incomplete blocks, the QRS interval is defined between 100 (or 110 by computer) and 120 ms (0.10 [or 0.11 by computer] to 0.12 sec).</p><p>The QRS vector in bundle branch block is generally oriented in the direction of the myocardial region in which depolarization is delayed. The major late QRS vector is normally directed to the left and posteriorly due to depolarization of the left ventricle. However, right bundle branch block (RBBB) delays activation of the right ventricle to the late phase of depolarization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56402\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56402 \">movie 1</a>). As a result, the terminal QRS vector is oriented anteriorly and to the right. This vector points toward the positive axis of the anterior-posterior lead V1 and away from the positive axis of left-right lead V6. Therefore, these changes are represented on the ECG by a late positive wave (rSR) in V1 and a late negative wave (qRS) in V6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64393\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64393 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61905\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61905 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is different in that it alters both early and late phases of ventricular depolarization. The late QRS vector is still directed to the left and posteriorly, since depolarization is delayed in the left ventricle. However, the normal early left-to-right pattern of septal activation is disrupted so that septal depolarization proceeds from right-to-left as well. As a result, LBBB generates wide, predominantly negative (QS) complexes in lead V1 and entirely positive (wide R wave) complexes in lead V6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61594\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef61594 \">waveform 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81484 \">table 2</a>). A pattern identical to that of LBBB, preceded by a sharp spike, is seen in most cases of electronic right ventricular pacing because of the relative delay in left ventricular activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">ST-T abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bundle branch blocks and pacemaker patterns are characteristically associated with secondary repolarization (ST-T) abnormalities. The T wave is typically opposite in polarity to the last deflection of the QRS, a discordance due solely to the altered sequence of repolarization that occurs secondary to altered depolarization. This relationship is different from that seen with primary repolarization abnormalities induced by ischemia, electrolyte disorders, and drugs such as digitalis. The ST-T changes in this setting are independent of changes in the QRS, being induced by alterations in the electrical properties of the myocardial fibers (resting membrane potential or action potential duration), not just by changes in the sequence of repolarization.</p><p>Primary and secondary T wave changes can coexist. As examples, ST depression or T wave inversion in the right precordial leads with LBBB or in the left precordial leads with RBBB may be important markers of underlying ischemia.</p><p>T wave inversions in normally conducted beats following intermittent left bundle branch block or intermittent right ventricular electronic pacing (so-called &ldquo;memory T waves&rdquo;) are discussed separately. These repolarization findings are important because they may mimic myocardial ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction#H99426042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis of ECG abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359310213\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact on the QT interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of bundle branch block on the QT interval is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-basic-principles-of-ecg-analysis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Basic principles of ECG analysis&quot;, section on 'QT interval'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Major causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bundle branch blocks can occur in a variety of conditions. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is more commonly seen in subjects without structural heart disease than LBBB. RBBB also occurs with congenital (eg, atrial septal defect) and acquired (eg, valvular, ischemic) heart disease. In comparison, LBBB is often a marker of one of four underlying conditions: advanced coronary heart disease; long-standing hypertension; aortic valve disease; or cardiomyopathy. LBBB, especially with left atrial abnormality, is a highly specific sign of underlying left ventricular hypertrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">FASCICULAR BLOCKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial (fascicular) blocks (also called hemiblocks) in the left bundle system affect the left anterior, posterior, or median fascicle, singly or in combination. They generally do not substantially prolong QRS duration, as the primary electrocardiographic change is a shift in the frontal plane QRS axis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left anterior fascicular (hemi-) block leads to a QRS axis that is usually between -45&ordm; and -90&ordm; and is probably the most common cause of marked <strong>left axis deviation</strong>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-anterior-fascicular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left anterior fascicular block&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left posterior fascicular (hemi-) block is typically associated with a QRS axis of about +120&ordm;; it is a rare cause of <strong>right axis deviation</strong>. The diagnosis of left posterior fascicular block cannot be made without first excluding other causes of right axis deviation such as normal variants, acute or chronic right ventricular overload (eg, due to pulmonary embolism or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), lateral wall myocardial infarction, and dextrocardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71386\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71386 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-posterior-fascicular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left posterior fascicular block&quot;</a>.) Artifactual right axis deviation, induced by reversal of the right and left electrodes, also must be excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some individuals are thought to have a third fascicle of the left bundle, the left median fascicle. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings simulating septal or posterior wall myocardial infarction have both been attributed to block of this fascicle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-median-middle-or-septal-fascicular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left median (middle or septal) fascicular block&quot;</a>.) However, clinical readings that cite &ldquo;median fascicular block&rdquo; are distinctly uncommon in clinical practice, and not employed by the authors of this card.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A commonly posed clinical question is whether a sustained new or an intermittent left bundle branch block (LBBB) &ldquo;causes&rdquo; a leftward shift in axis in the wide-complex beats. Left bundle branch block with left axis deviation is usually associated with underlying severe organic heart disease (eg, coronary, hypertensive, valvular). LBBB with right axis deviation is extremely rare and usually the subject of case reports. This combination in adults (excluding lead misplacement or dextrocardia) appears to be most commonly associated with cardiomyopathy and may reflect biventricular enlargement or relatively greater slowing of conduction in the left posterior fascicle. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bifascicular and trifascicular block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More complex combinations of fascicular and bundle branch blocks can occur with involvement of both the left and right bundle system. Examples of <strong>bifascicular</strong>&nbsp;<strong>block</strong> include right bundle branch block and left posterior fascicular block, right bundle branch block with left anterior fascicular block, and complete left bundle branch block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71873\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef71873 \">waveform 3</a>). Chronic bifascicular block in an asymptomatic individual is associated with a relatively low risk of progression to high-degree atrioventricular (AV) heart block. In contrast, a new bifascicular block with acute anterior myocardial infarction carries a much greater risk of complete heart block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conduction abnormalities after myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Alternating right and left bundle branch block is interpreted as a sign of <strong>trifascicular</strong>&nbsp;<strong>block</strong>. In contrast, first degree AV block plus bifascicular block does <strong>not</strong> necessarily indicate trifascicular involvement, since this combination can reflect slow conduction in the AV node with concomitant bifascicular block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF WIDE QRS COMPLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolongation of QRS duration can be induced by intrinsic (right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, or other intraventricular conduction delay) or extrinsic (&ldquo;toxic&rdquo;) factors (especially hyperkalemia and certain drugs), a ventricular beat (premature, paced or as an escape complex), or preexcitation of the ventricles via a bypass tract as in the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern and its variants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70491\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70491 \">table 4</a>). The diagnostic triad of the WPW pattern consists of a wide QRS complex, a relatively short PR interval, and slurring of the initial part of the QRS complex (delta wave) due to aberrant activation of ventricular myocardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63783\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63783 \">waveform 4</a>). The presence of a bypass tract predisposes to reentrant supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias-approach-to-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES AND DYSSYNCHRONY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a growing appreciation for the clinical significance of dyssynchronous ventricular contraction. Normal, rapid conduction of the depolarizing wavefront results in synchronous (near simultaneous) contraction of the left- and right-sided ventricular myocardium, which optimizes mechanical pump function. Delayed activation, particularly of the lateral wall of the left ventricle, can produce dyssynchronous contraction, which impairs ventricular pump efficacy.</p><p>Mechanical dyssynchrony is usually associated with abnormalities of intraventricular conduction, particularly left bundle branch block (LBBB). This correlation is imperfect; not all patients with conduction abnormalities have mechanical dyssynchrony, and mechanical dyssynchrony has been documented in some patients without QRS prolongation. Mechanical dyssynchrony can also be caused by right ventricular pacing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Implantation and other considerations&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In patients with reduced left ventricular function, mechanical dyssynchrony, and heart failure, cardiac resynchronization with biventricular pacing can improve ventricular function, symptoms, and survival. This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365088857\"><span class=\"h1\">IVCD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiologists use the term &ldquo;intraventricular conduction delay (or <span class=\"nowrap\">defect/disturbance)&rdquo;</span> (IVCD) in different contexts, creating potential confusion among some specialists and non-specialists. </p><p>IVCD refers to abnormalities in the intraventricular propagation of supraventricular impulses that give rise to changes in the shape <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duration of the QRS complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-approach-to-delayed-intraventricular-conduction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As such, this term includes classic left and right bundle branch block patterns and their variants, as well as left anterior and left posterior fascicular blocks (hemiblocks). </p><p>As defined above, this term has also been used to include Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pre-excitation patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-approach-to-delayed-intraventricular-conduction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, as indicated by the term &ldquo;pre-excitation,&rdquo; WPW patterns are initiated by early (not delayed) ventricular depolarization. Thus, WPW patterns and their variants are not usually considered as IVCDs. To avoid confusion, the authors favor considering WPW patterns as separate from the category of IVCD, but as qualifying as types of anomalous or aberrant ventricular activation. </p><p>The term &ldquo;IVCD&rdquo; is also used to refer to QRS complexes that are wide (usually with duration 0.11 to 0.12 seconds or greater in adults), but do not have a classical left or right bundle morphology, or that have features of both. The term nonspecific<em> </em>IVCD is helpful in designating this category since it implies that the QRS does not show a classic left or right bundle branch block morphology. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8106582\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of disturbances of the <span class=\"nowrap\">His-Purkinje/ventricular</span> conduction system can affect the electrocardiogram (ECG) in distinctive ways and lead to a wide QRS complex <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> axis deviation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left and right bundle branch block are examples of intraventricular conduction delays.
