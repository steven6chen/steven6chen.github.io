Synonyms include Weil's disease, Weil-Vasiliev disease, Swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, waterborne fever, nanukayami fever, cane-cutter fever, swamp fever, mud fever, Stuttgart disease, and Canicola fever.</p><p>The treatment and prevention of leptospirosis will be presented here. The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leptospirosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leptospirosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of leptospirosis are self-limited in the absence of antimicrobial therapy, although a proportion of patients do develop severe complications with significant morbidity and mortality. In general, if the illness is severe enough to come to clinical attention and the diagnosis is recognized, antibiotic therapy should be administered.</p><p>In the setting of severe illness due to leptospirosis, supportive care with renal replacement therapy, ventilatory support, and blood products may also be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In general, such management is the same as organ failure due to other causes of sepsis. In one Brazilian study of patients with complications of leptospirosis including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI), daily hemodialysis was associated with significantly lower mortality than alternate-day dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hypokalemia is common in non-oliguric AKI associated with leptospirosis and should be corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Recovery of renal function after the acute period is generally rapid and complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. For patients with ARDS, low net fluid intake to prevent pulmonary hemorrhage and lung-protective ventilation practices are appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7863015\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7863193\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic patients presenting for medical attention should receive antimicrobial therapy to shorten the duration of illness and reduce shedding of organisms in the urine. We suggest the following approach, which varies with the clinical presentation.</p><p>For outpatients with mild disease, we favor treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (adults: 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days; children &ge;8 years of age: 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in two equally divided doses [not to exceed 200 mg daily] for 7 days) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (adults: 500 mg orally once daily for three days; children: 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally on day 1 [maximum dose 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day]</span> followed by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> orally once daily on subsequent days [maximum dose 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day])</span>. These agents also have activity against rickettsial disease, which can be confused with leptospirosis. For children &lt;8 years and pregnant women, we favor treatment with either azithromycin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> (25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in three equally divided doses [maximum 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dose]</span> for 7 days).</p><p>For hospitalized adults with severe disease, we favor treatment with penicillin (1.5 million units intravenously [IV] every six hours), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg IV twice daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (1 to 2 g IV once daily), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> (1 g IV every six hours). The duration of treatment in severe disease is usually seven days.</p><p>For hospitalized children with severe disease, we favor treatment with penicillin (250,000 to 400,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> IV per day in four to six divided doses [maximum dose 6 to 12 million units daily]), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV per day in two equally divided doses [maximum dose 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day]),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV once daily [maximum dose 2 g daily]), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> (100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV per day in three to four equally divided doses). Doxycycline should be avoided in children &lt;8 years of age unless there are no other treatment options. The duration of treatment in severe disease is usually seven days.</p><p>For hospitalized children &lt;8 years of age with severe disease and beta-lactam hypersensitivity, we favor therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV on day 1 [maximum dose 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day],</span> followed by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> IV once daily on subsequent days [maximum dose 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day])</span>.</p><p>Pregnant women with severe leptospirosis may be treated with penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> should not be used.</p><p>A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction may occur following antimicrobial therapy for leptospirosis; this is an acute inflammatory response to clearance of spirochetes from the circulation and is characterized clinically by fever, rigors, and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In one series including 262 patients with leptospirosis, a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurred in 21 percent of cases; risk factors included infection with the <em>L. interrogans</em> serogroup Australis strain and &lt;3 days between symptom onset and antibiotic therapy. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Penicillin and cephalosporins lack activity against rickettsiae and so should be avoided in circumstances in which leptospirosis cannot be definitively distinguished from rickettsial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is an appropriate therapy for treatment of severely ill patients in areas endemic for both leptospirosis and rickettsial infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether antimicrobials produce a beneficial effect in mild illness remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. A Cochrane review noted that antimicrobial therapy does not affect mortality, though there was a nonsignificant trend toward quicker resolution of clinical illness (by two to four days) with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a retrospective case-control study from New Caledonia, risk factors for the development of severe leptospirosis included a delay of &gt;2 days following the start of symptoms in the initiation of antibiotic treatment, suggesting that antibiotics may reduce the likelihood of progression to severe disease in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Activity against leptospires has been observed in vitro and in animal models for penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a>, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telithromycin</a>, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that carbapenems and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a> also have excellent activity against leptospires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. Antibiotic susceptibility testing is not done routinely as it is difficult to do and, thus far, resistance does not appear to be a problem, based on susceptibility studies that have been done as well as favorable clinical response to the antibiotics generally used for treatment. The development of a new solid media (LVW agar) for leptospirosis may facilitate more routine testing, which will enable quicker identification of drug resistance should it arise in the setting of inadequate clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Studies from Thailand have noted comparable efficacy for penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for treatment of leptospirosis. In one study of 173 patients with severe leptospirosis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> (1.5 million units IV every six hours for seven days) was compared with ceftriaxone (1 g IV every 24 hours for seven days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study, 540 patients with suspected severe leptospirosis (264 serologically confirmed) were randomized to treatment with cefotaxime (1 g IV every six hours for seven days), penicillin G (1.5 million units IV every six hours for seven days), or doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours for seven days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In both studies, all regimens had similar efficacy for leptospirosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In another study, 296 patients in Thailand with suspected leptospirosis or scrub typhus were randomized to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg orally every 12 hours for seven days) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (2 g on day 1 followed by 1 g daily for two more days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There was no difference in fever clearance times; oral azithromycin was better tolerated than doxycycline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7863340\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of intravenous corticosteroid therapy has been proposed given the vasculitic nature of severe leptospirosis, particularly in the setting of pulmonary involvement; thus far, there is insufficient evidence for routine use of corticosteroids. Some reports have suggested a possible benefit to use of steroids as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]; further study is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several human vaccines have been developed; all are serovar specific, developed for specific epidemiologic circumstances. None is widely available. Prevention measures include avoiding potential sources of infection, administration of prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of exposure, and animal vaccination.</p><p>The most important control measures for preventing human leptospirosis include avoiding potential sources of infection such as stagnant water and animal farm water runoff, rodent control, and protection of food from animal contamination.</p><p>Antimicrobial prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of exposure may be useful in some settings. Among more than 700 individuals in the Andaman Islands (a highly endemic setting in Southeast Asia where outbreaks of leptospirosis related to flooding are common) randomized to prophylaxis with weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or placebo, clinical infection rates were lower among those who received doxycycline (3.1 versus 6.8 percent), although there was no difference in seroconversion rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In another study including more than 900 soldiers deployed for jungle training in Panama, fewer cases of leptospirosis were observed among those who received doxycycline prophylaxis (200 mg orally every week for two to three weeks and at the end of exposure) compared with placebo (1 versus 20 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Vaccination of domestic and farm animals against leptospirosis can provide variable levels of protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leptospirosis/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Some immunized animals become infected and excrete leptospires in their urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
