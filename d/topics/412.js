The most common group is collectively referred to as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). They are most often located in the stomach and proximal small intestine, but can occur in any portion of the alimentary tract and occasionally in the omentum, mesentery, and peritoneum. The far less common group is comprised of a spectrum of tumors that are identical to those that might arise in the soft tissues throughout the rest of the body (ie, lipomas, liposarcomas, leiomyomas, true leiomyosarcomas, desmoid tumors, schwannomas, and peripheral nerve sheath tumors). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of GISTs have mutations in the <em>KIT</em> protooncogene that lead to constitutive activation of KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). A subset of GISTs lacking <em>KIT</em> gene mutations harbors activating mutations in a related RTK, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA). Approximately 12 percent of GISTs have no mutation in either <em>KIT</em> or <em>PDGFRA</em> (&quot;wild type&quot; for these two kinase genes), and the majority of these have mutations or epigenetic silencing of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits leading to the SDH-deficient GIST. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, clinical presentation, prognostic features, and diagnostic work-up of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)&quot;, section on 'Classification and molecular pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>These findings led to the development of effective systemic therapies in the form of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), of which the prototype is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. These agents block signaling via KIT and PDGFRA by binding to the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket required for phosphorylation and activation of the receptor. The end result is inhibition of tumor proliferation. The success of these agents in advanced disease prompted interest in their use in the preoperative setting as induction therapy for patients with unresectable or borderline resectable tumors and as adjuvant treatment for patients at high risk of recurrence after complete resection of a primary GIST tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover the perioperative use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> for localized GIST tumors.

However, there is no consensus on the management of smaller tumors, and management must be individualized. Although small gastric GISTs may be followed endoscopically until they grow or become symptomatic, the optimal frequency of follow-up and specific risks of this strategy are uncertain. An algorithmic approach to management of GISTs based upon size and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] has been adopted by the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7730\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> for gastric GISTs but not those at other sites in the GI tract. We agree with this approach. When endoscopic assessment is not possible, excision is the standard approach.

While surgical resection is the treatment of choice for potentially resectable tumors, initial therapy with imatinib may be preferred if a tumor is borderline resectable, locally advanced and unresectable but nonmetastatic, or a potentially resectable primary tumor if a reduction in tumor size would significantly decrease the morbidity of surgical resection (eg, a GIST arising in the esophagus, esophagogastric junction, duodenum, or distal rectum). In such cases, a tumor biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and establish tumor genotype:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do not administer neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> to patients who have a platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (<em>PDGFRA</em>) D842V mutation, or a succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient or neurofibromatosis (NF)-related GIST, and instead proceed directly to surgery.

For the rare patient who is being considered for neoadjuvant therapy and whose tumor harbors an exon 9 <em>KIT</em> mutation (the majority of these mutations are in small bowel primaries, which are uncommonly treated neoadjuvantly), which confers relative resistance to imatinib, an initial dose of 800 mg per day may be preferred, if tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The optimal duration of neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is not established. In most cases, patients are treated to &quot;maximal response,&quot; usually not exceeding 10 to 12 months.

Regardless of the tool used for risk stratification, we reserve adjuvant imatinib for those patients who meet criteria for &quot;high-risk&quot; and who have an estimated risk of recurrence that is &gt;30 to 50 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of recurrence risk'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We perform molecular analysis on all tumors if adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is being considered. For patients with a <em>PDGFRA</em> D842V mutation, or an SDH-deficient or NF-related GIST, we do not prescribe adjuvant imatinib. For other patients, the usual dose of imatinib for adjuvant therapy is 400 mg daily. Based upon an analysis of data from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z9001 trial, for patients who harbor an exon 9 <em>KIT</em> mutation, which confers relative resistance to adjuvant imatinib, a dose of 800 mg per day may be preferred, if tolerated.

The optimal duration of adjuvant treatment is not yet established. (See <a href=\"#H1805370\" class=\"local\">'SSG XVIII trial'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For all patients undergoing neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, imatinib should be continued postoperatively to complete a total of at least three years of imatinib therapy (combined preoperative and postoperative). Use of preoperative imatinib prohibits accurate assessment of recurrence risk, based upon analysis of the surgical resection specimen.

Patients who present with metastatic disease should undergo an initial biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to establish the tumor genotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications for surgery</strong> &ndash; There is no consensus as to the indications for surgical management in patients with metastatic GIST. Surgery may be considered in patients with potentially resectable metastases who do not develop generalized disease progression while receiving therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and for the rare patient who becomes resectable after receiving neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> for initially unresectable metastatic disease at a limited number of sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Local treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Role of surgery in patients with metastatic disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;, section on 'Management of imatinib-refractory or intolerant patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Resection may also benefit selected patients with more advanced disease who are responding to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> (ie, those who have a partial response, stable disease, or focal progression, and possibly, those with isolated sites of progression). The purpose of resection in this setting is to delay or prevent the development of resistant clones by reducing tumor burden. Surgery has little to offer those who experience generalized disease progression while receiving a TKI, and it should not be attempted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All patients should resume therapy with a TKI for an indefinite period of time after resection of metastatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon data from the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SSG) XVIII trial, we recommend adjuvant treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> 400 mg daily) for a minimum of three years in patients who have a completely resected, primary, high-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The optimal duration (three years versus longer than three years) is not yet established. (See <a href=\"#H1805370\" class=\"local\">'SSG XVIII trial'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal selection of patients who are at sufficiently high risk for recurrence to warrant adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is not established. Several risk stratification tools are available, based upon tumor size, mitotic rate, location, and in some cases, the presence or absence of tumor rupture and molecular genotype. However, particularly for tools, such as nomograms, that quantify the risk of disease recurrence after complete resection as a continuous variable, it is not clear what cutoff for disease recurrence should be used to select patients for imatinib. Thus, each case must be approached individually, balancing the estimated likelihood of a disease recurrence (based upon anatomic site, size, mitotic rate, and presence or absence of tumor rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85938 \">table 1</a>)) with the risks of therapy. Adjuvant therapy is appropriate for all patients who fall into a &quot;high-risk&quot; category, regardless of the risk stratification model used. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of recurrence risk'</a> below.)</p><p>Some centers, including that of the authors, routinely genotype all patients with GIST who are being considered for adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. Adjuvant imatinib is not indicated in patients with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GIST, neurofibromatosis (NF)-related GIST, and <em>PDGFRA</em> D842V GIST. For patients whose tumors harbor a <em>KIT</em> exon 9 mutation, higher-dose imatinib (800 rather than 400 mg daily) is a reasonable option, if tolerated, although there are no prospective data upon which to base a recommendation either for or against this practice.</p><p>The standard of care for patients with a primary resectable GIST is surgery, aiming for a macroscopically complete resection with negative microscopic margins. Complete resection is possible in the majority of localized GISTs, but only approximately one-half remain recurrence-free for five or more years with surgery alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Local treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The success of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> in the setting of advanced disease prompted interest in its use in the adjuvant setting after complete resection of a primary tumor or metastatic disease. Based upon data from the randomized American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z9000 and SSG XVII trials, we recommend adjuvant treatment with imatinib for a minimum of three years in patients who have a completely resected, primary, higher risk GIST.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimation of recurrence risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimation of recurrence risk following resection of a GIST is of paramount importance when selecting patients who could possibly benefit from adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. Several criteria have been proposed, originally to classify the malignant potential of a GIST. Although the terms &quot;benign&quot; and &quot;malignant&quot; are no longer applied to GIST since all are considered to have at least some potential to behave in a malignant fashion (either with unresectable invasive recurrence or with metastatic disease), tumor size, mitotic rate, and site of tumor origin have gained the greatest acceptance as being predictive of the risk of recurrence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

As an example, largely based upon these data from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), which represent the largest published experience with GISTs diagnosed and treated in the modern era for which long-term clinical follow-up is available, a tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for GIST was developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and published in 2010&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H11883426\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> below.)</p><p>This issue was addressed in an analysis of data from 10 different population-based published series totaling 2560 patients with completely resected GIST, none of whom received adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Tumors were classified according to the NIH consensus criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53231\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53231 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], a modification of the NIH consensus criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85938 \">table 1</a>) that includes site as well as tumor rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and the AFIP criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60930 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Large tumor size, high mitotic counts, non-gastric location, presence of rupture, and male sex were all independent adverse prognostic factors. Most recurrences occurred within the first five years of follow-up, and most patients were cured by surgery alone (estimated 5-, 10-, and 15-year relapse-free survival [RFS] rates 71, 63, and 60 percent, respectively).</p><p>A comparison of the NIH, modified NIH, and AFIP criteria showed that all risk stratification schemes appropriately predicted RFS and identified high-risk patients. The proposed modified NIH criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85938 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] were best at identifying a single subgroup of patients at high-risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. With all of the different classification schemes, those patients who were identified as intermediate-risk had a clinical course that was similar to that of the low-risk group, suggesting that only the high-risk patients would likely benefit from adjuvant therapy. These investigators also developed a novel risk stratification scheme in which tumor size and mitotic counts were assessed as continuous non-linear variables; novel prognostic contour maps were generated based upon these data plus site and tumor rupture. These maps were better than conventional models at predicting 10-year risk for GIST recurrence and would be particularly useful for discussing individual risk with patients as they are graphic and easy to explain.</p><p>Whether the results of molecular testing should also be integrated into risk stratification schemes is unclear. There has been relatively little work to make predictions of risk based on genotypic subsets of primary resected GIST, although there are data to support the fact that certain genotypes (such as <em>KIT</em> wild-type GISTs that are SDH-deficient or NF-related, or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha [<em>PDGFRA</em>] D842V-mutant tumors) are less aggressive with a lower risk of recurrence or metastasis following primary resection than are other molecular subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Furthermore, there are no data demonstrating the benefit of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> in these subtypes nor basic scientific rationale for antitumor activity.

In this trial, 713 adults with a completely resected primary gastrointestinal GIST at least 3 cm in maximal diameter and immunohistochemically positive for KIT protein were randomly assigned to one year of adjuvant imatinib (400 mg daily) or placebo.

Two important issues are the value of longer duration imatinib following complete resection and the definition of subsets of patients who derive the most benefit from adjuvant imatinib. Patients with GIST of more than 3 cm are a highly heterogeneous population within which the risk of relapse and death varies considerably. Furthermore, as noted above, the risk of relapse is affected not only by size, but also by mitotic index, location of the primary site, and molecular factors.

The primary endpoint was originally overall survival, but the protocol was modified in 2009 to change the primary endpoint to imatinib failure-free survival (IFFS, the time to death or starting a TKI other than imatinib); the accrual target was subsequently also increased. At a median follow-up of 4.7 years, five-year IFFS was 87 percent in the imatinib arm compared with 84 percent in the control arm (HR 0.79, 98.5% CI 0.50-1.25), three-year RFS was 84 versus 66 percent, and five-year overall survival was 100 versus 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Similarly, when risk was stratified according to modified NIH risk stratification criteria to include primary tumor site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85938 \">table 1</a>), the difference in IFFS between the treated and control groups was still not statistically significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1805370\"><span class=\"h4\">SSG XVIII trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SSG) XVIII trial compared 36 versus 12 months of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (400 mg daily) in 400 patients with high-risk resected GIST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Approximately 80 percent have mutations in the <em>KIT</em> protooncogene that lead to constitutive activation of KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). A subset of GISTs lacking <em>KIT</em> gene mutations harbors activating mutations in a related RTK, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA). Approximately 12 percent of GISTs have no mutation in either <em>KIT</em> or <em>PDGFRA</em> (&quot;wild type&quot; for these two kinase genes), and the majority of these have mutations or epigenetic silencing of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits, leading to the SDH-deficient GIST. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard of care for patients with a primary resectable GIST is surgery, aiming for a macroscopically complete resection with negative microscopic margins. Complete resection is possible in the majority of localized GISTs, but only approximately one-half remain recurrence-free for five or more years with surgery alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, block signaling via KIT and PDGFRA, thus halting tumor proliferation. The success of these agents in advanced disease has prompted interest in perioperative use in patients with earlier stage disease. An approach to treatment of GISTs, integrating the use of adjuvant (postoperative) and neoadjuvant (preoperative) imatinib, is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104075\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104075 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H93127227\" class=\"local\">'Overview of approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon data from the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SSG) XVIII trial, we recommend adjuvant treatment with a TKI (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> 400 mg daily) for a minimum of three years in patients who have a completely resected primary high-risk GIST (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The optimal duration (three years versus longer than three years) is not yet established. (See <a href=\"#H1805370\" class=\"local\">'SSG XVIII trial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal selection of patients who are at sufficiently high risk for recurrence to warrant adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is not established. Several risk stratification tools are available, based upon tumor size, mitotic rate, location, and in some cases, the presence or absence of tumor rupture and molecular genotype. However, particularly for tools, such as nomograms, that quantify the risk of disease recurrence after complete resection as a continuous variable, it is not clear what cutoff for disease recurrence should be used to select patients for imatinib. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of recurrence risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, each case must be approached individually, balancing the estimated likelihood of a disease recurrence (based upon anatomic site, size, mitotic rate, and presence or absence of tumor rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85938 \">table 1</a>)) with the risks of therapy. Adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is appropriate for all patients who fall into a &quot;high-risk&quot; category, regardless of the risk stratification model used. (See <a href=\"#H11883426\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some centers, including that of the authors, routinely genotype all patients with GIST who are being considered for adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. Adjuvant imatinib is not indicated in patients with SDH-deficient GIST, neurofibromatosis (NF)-related GIST, and <em>PDGFRA</em> D842V GIST. For patients whose tumors harbor a <em>KIT</em> exon 9 mutation, higher-dose imatinib (800 rather than 400 mg daily) is a reasonable option, if tolerated, although there are no prospective data upon which to base a recommendation either for or against this practice. (See <a href=\"#H6457205\" class=\"local\">'Imatinib dosing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;, section on 'Influence of mutations on response to therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus as to the indications for neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. For patients with apparently localized tumors, we suggest initial treatment with imatinib for patients with locally advanced unresectable or borderline resectable tumors; for potentially resectable primary tumors, if a reduction in tumor size would significantly decrease the morbidity of surgical resection; and for most patients with a rectal GIST, unless the tumor is small and sphincter-preserving surgery is possible upfront (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If possible, such patients should be enrolled in a clinical trial. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H97257749\" class=\"local\">'Rectal GISTs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> at a dose of 400 mg daily. At the authors' institutions, tumor genotyping is performed for all patients being considered for neoadjuvant imatinib. If an exon 9 mutation is identified in a rare patient being considered for neoadjuvant imatinib, the option of a higher daily dose (800 mg per day) should be discussed with patients, although there are no prospective data upon which to base a recommendation either for or against this practice. Most of these patients will have a small bowel primary tumor and be referred for upfront surgery rather than neoadjuvant imatinib.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with a <em>PDGFRA</em> D842V mutation or those with wild-type tumors (neither <em>KIT</em> nor <em>PDGFRA</em> mutations), we do not use neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> and, instead, proceed directly to surgery. If routine genotyping is not practiced, it is probably wise to check for an early response to neoadjuvant imatinib using computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or contrast-enhanced ultrasound. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Response assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal duration of neoadjuvant TKIs is not established. The decision as to how long to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> and when to operate (ie, at first resectability versus after achieving maximal response) must be individualized and based upon drug tolerance, tumor location and extent, the results of periodic radiographic assessment, and the urgency of surgical treatment. In general, we treat to maximal response and try to limit neoadjuvant treatment to no more than 10 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H108702617\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients undergoing neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, we continue imatinib postoperatively to complete a total of at least three years of imatinib therapy (combined preoperative and postoperative). (See <a href=\"#H337217509\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with potentially resectable metastatic GIST who do not have a <em>PDGFRA</em> D842V mutation or a wild-type GIST, we suggest neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> rather than upfront resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The optimal duration of neoadjuvant imatinib is uncertain, and we individualize this decision based upon drug tolerance, tumor location and extent, and radiographic assessment during neoadjuvant imatinib.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Selected patients with unresectable metastatic GIST may also be considered for resection. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery should be offered only to patients whose disease is stable or responding to TKI therapy, or who have only focal progression. Patients with extensive disease progression while on TKI therapy gain little benefit from surgery, and it should not be pursued. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Local treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Role of surgery in patients with metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cytoreductive surgery in this setting often requires extensive potentially morbid procedures, such as gastrectomy, hepatectomy, and pancreatic resection, and should be carried out in centers of excellence. All patients should resume therapy with a TKI after resection. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Patients with metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong> &mdash; The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge George Demetri, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sepe PS, Brugge WR.
