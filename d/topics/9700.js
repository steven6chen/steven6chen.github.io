Knowledge of subtle clinical features and laboratory abnormalities that accompany LEMS permits the early identification of the disorder. Early recognition is particularly important because of its strong association with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Although LEMS can occur at any point in the course of SCLC, it may serve as a marker for early disease.</p><p>This topic will review the pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of LEMS. Treatment and prognosis of LEMS is discussed separately.

Lambert and Elmqvist, through a series of elegant intracellular muscle recordings, found that patients with what is now called LEMS had the following unique features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal miniature endplate potential amplitude, demonstrating normal postsynaptic sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markedly reduced evoked endplate potential amplitude, suggesting a significant reduction in ACh release</p><p/><p>Acetylcholine release was increased by increasing calcium concentrations but not by potassium-induced membrane depolarization.

However, non-paraneoplastic LEMS is associated with underlying immune-mediated diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. One study found that autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorders, occurred in 27 percent of LEMS patients without cancer and 11 percent of those with LEMS and SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Families of patients with non-paraneoplastic LEMS had an increased frequency of autoimmune diseases, with affected family members linked through the maternal line; in contrast, families of patients with paraneoplastic LEMS had no increased frequency of autoimmune diseases. In another study, patients with non-paraneoplastic LEMS had an increased incidence of organ-specific autoantibodies to thyroid, gastric, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skeletal muscle compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of LEMS is unknown, but the condition is uncommon and occurs much less frequently than myasthenia gravis, the other major disorder of neuromuscular junction transmission. In a population-based study from a region of Holland with 1.7 million inhabitants, 220 cases of myasthenia gravis and 10 of LEMS were identified over a nine-year period; the annual incidence and prevalence of LEMS was 0.5 and 2.3 per million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A similar prevalence for confirmed cases of LEMS (2.6 per million) was reported in a later population-based study of 12.5 million patients in the US Veterans Affairs health system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Most cases of LEMS occur among middle-aged adults, but LEMS can affect younger and older adults, and rare cases have been reported in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, the age of LEMS onset is earlier in patients without cancer (non-paraneoplastic LEMS) compared with those with cancer (paraneoplastic LEMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Approximately one-half of LEMS cases are associated with a malignancy, mainly small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and less often with lymphoproliferative disorders.

Occasional patients have a subacute or acute presentation. The clinical signs of LEMS parallel the symptoms.</p><p>Most often, LEMS has a pattern more suggestive of a myopathy than a neuromuscular junction disorder, with slowly progressive proximal lower extremity weakness, distinctive autonomic findings, a smattering of oculobulbar findings, and recovery of lost deep tendon reflexes or improvement in muscle strength with vigorous, brief muscle activation.</p><p>The paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic forms of LEMS have similar signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, those with an underlying malignancy may experience more rapid progression of neurologic symptoms than those without cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28</a>].</p><p>Some patients have combined paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and LEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a series of Japanese patients with LEMS, 9 of 65 patients (14 percent) with SCLC had appendicular ataxia, probably from associated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. All nine patients had high titers of voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies compared with none of the 45 patients without cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4283891375\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients typically describe an alteration in gait or difficulty arising from a chair or managing stairs caused by proximal leg weakness. Upper extremity complaints are usually modest and typically involve proximal muscle function. Many describe aching or stiff muscles. Muscle fatigability or cramping is common, particularly after protracted exercise.</p><p>Proximal limb weakness without significant muscle atrophy is the most frequent finding. The degree of weakness is often less than the functional difficulty would lead one to expect, a discrepancy that sometimes leads to a misdiagnosis of conversion reaction. There tends to be relative preservation of distal muscle function. Deep tendon reflexes are almost always depressed or absent. Ptosis is the most common cranial nerve finding in LEMS; extraocular, pharyngeal, tongue, and neck muscles are less often affected. (See <a href=\"#H4154845334\" class=\"local\">'Ptosis and cranial nerve involvement'</a> below.)</p><p>Compared with patients who have non-paraneoplastic LEMS, patients with paraneoplastic LEMS and small cell lung cancer typically have a more rapidly progressive course with a greater degree of weakness involving proximal and distal arm muscles and distal leg muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Symmetrical muscle involvement is the most common pattern in LEMS. However, there are observations of patients presenting with regional weakness (eg, weakness in one area only, such as the proximal legs alone, or weakness isolated to limb, ocular, oropharyngeal, or respiratory muscles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931002177\"><span class=\"h2\">Postexercise facilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recovery of lost deep tendon reflexes or improvement in muscle strength with vigorous, brief muscle activation is a unique aspect of LEMS. Maximal isometric contraction of the relevant muscle for 10 to 15 seconds can sometimes lead to temporary reappearance of previously depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes, and to temporary improvement of muscle weakness. This phenomenon, referred to as postexercise or postactivation facilitation, is often the defining bedside clinical observation and should be part of the routine examination of a patient with proximal muscle weakness or even complaints of weakness, especially when hyporeflexia or areflexia are conjoined. Postexercise or postactivation facilitation are also applied to an increase in compound muscle action potential amplitude that may be seen with repetitive nerve stimulation or brief exercise in patients with LEMS. (See <a href=\"#H1145395837\" class=\"local\">'Electrodiagnostic studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of possible facilitation after exercise, reflexes and muscle power testing are best performed after a period of rest. More sustained physical activity can often induce muscle weakness (fatigable weakness). At times, this pattern can appear to represent an inconsistent effort on the part of the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3935533503\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autonomic dysfunction is often present in patients with LEMS and can be an important clue to the diagnosis, though it is rarely a defining feature. Dry mouth from reduced salivation is the most common autonomic symptom and is occasionally the presenting complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Symmetric, sluggish pupillary light responses are also common, as is erectile dysfunction in men with LEMS. In a study of autonomic dysfunction in LEMS involving 30 patients, dry mouth was identified in 77 percent of patients, and impotence was present in 45 percent of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Abnormalities were found in tests of sudomotor function (83 percent), cardiovagal reflexes (75 percent), salivation (44 percent), and adrenergic function (37 percent). Other autonomic symptoms may include blurred vision and constipation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4154845334\"><span class=\"h2\">Ptosis and cranial nerve involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial nerve involvement is present in a minority of patients with LEMS but is typically less severe and less striking than that seen in myasthenia gravis. Ocular symptoms, particularly ptosis and diplopia, are the most common cranial nerve manifestation with LEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Oropharyngeal symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia, and difficulty chewing have also been occasionally observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>A useful clinical sign is that excessive or paradoxical eyelid elevation may occur after sustained upgaze in patients with LEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This finding is in contradistinction to the fatigable ptosis commonly seen in patients with myasthenia gravis during the same maneuver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initial eye muscle weakness is uncommon in LEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], but patients with LEMS can develop prominent ocular or oropharyngeal manifestations, during the course of their illness. One retrospective report found initial extraocular muscle weakness occurred in none of the 38 patients with LEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another retrospective series of 23 patients with LEMS, the presenting symptoms were ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, or dysphagia in 7 (30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. During the course of LEMS, ptosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diplopia were noted in 15 patients (65 percent), and dysphagia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysarthria in 12 (52 percent). There is also a case report of a patient with pure ocular weakness due to LEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most patients with LEMS do not have significant diaphragmatic involvement, particularly in the early stages of the illness, respiratory failure can occur late in the course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. Thus, LEMS must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with neuromuscular respiratory failure.</p><p>Even in patients without respiratory symptoms, detailed investigations into respiratory muscle function with transdiaphragmatic pressure recording, sustained inspiratory force measurements, and phrenic nerve stimulation may reveal mild to moderate respiratory weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1780066161\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of LEMS deserves careful consideration for any patient who presents with proximal muscle weakness. The collection of limb weakness, dry mouth, hyporeflexia, and any combination of oropharyngeal muscle weakness or ptosis should strongly suggest the diagnosis. A significant degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to recognize the atypical patient with LEMS, such as those who present with isolated respiratory insufficiency or regional weakness isolated to limb, ocular, or oropharyngeal muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692195893\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirming the diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected LEMS should have electrodiagnostic studies, including repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-P/Q-type</span> voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody testing to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>The diagnosis of LEMS is confirmed on low frequency RNS by a reproducible postexercise increase in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude of at least 100 percent compared with pre-exercise baseline value (see <a href=\"#H189349519\" class=\"local\">'Repetitive nerve stimulation and exercise testing'</a> below). A high titer <span class=\"nowrap\">P/Q-type</span> VGCC antibody result is strongly suggestive of LEMS in the appropriate clinical setting (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'VGCC antibody testing'</a> below). However, <span class=\"nowrap\">P/Q-type</span> VGCC antibodies are present in a variety of clinical situations where LEMS is not present. If these studies are not definitive, single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) can be diagnostic for a neuromuscular junction disorder but is less specific for LEMS than the above studies (see <a href=\"#H1053200390\" class=\"local\">'Single fiber electromyography'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145395837\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrodiagnostic evaluation of suspected LEMS typically involves the following elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine motor and sensory nerve conduction studies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-frequency RNS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exercise testing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needle electromyography (EMG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SFEMG for selected patients only</p><p/><p>All patients suspected of LEMS require a routine set of nerve conduction studies (NCS) and a conventional EMG in addition to either a post exercise motor nerve test or a high-frequency RNS test.

SFEMG is very sensitive for a neuromuscular junction disorder but not as specific for a presynaptic localization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191569971\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CMAP of resting muscle in patients with LEMS usually has a significantly reduced baseline amplitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In fact, the presence of unexpectedly low motor amplitudes, especially with normal sensory amplitudes, should suggest the possibility of a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder. At times, excessive variability in maximum CMAP amplitude from stimulus to stimulus should be a hint to consider LEMS as well. In patients with LEMS, distal latencies and conduction velocities are normal.</p><p>Occasionally, an electrophysiologist makes the diagnosis of LEMS when it was not suspected clinically on the basis of isolated low CMAP amplitudes. For patients with low or borderline-low CMAP amplitudes at rest, repeating the motor nerve conduction distal motor stimulation after 10 seconds of maximal exercise is recommended to look for post-exercise facilitation of the CMAP amplitude, which is a characteristic finding in LEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189349519\"><span class=\"h3\">Repetitive nerve stimulation and exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During high-frequency (10 to 50 Hz) RNS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58848\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef58848 \">waveform 1</a>) or after brief (eg, 10 seconds) maximal isometric muscle activation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66509\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66509 \">waveform 2</a>), patients with LEMS typically have a significant increment with a marked increase in the CMAP amplitude. The increase in the CMAP amplitude with high-frequency stimulation is referred to as postactivation facilitation, and the increase in CMAP amplitude after brief isometric exercise (compared with the baseline pre-exercise CMAP amplitude) is called postexercise facilitation.</p><p>An increase in the CMAP amplitude &gt;100 percent after exercise or with high-frequency RNS is considered diagnostic of a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>], and the increase is frequently even greater.

However, when there is a strong level of clinical suspicion for LEMS, the high-frequency RNS test is indicated for patients who do not show a diagnostic incremental increase in CMAP amplitude after the exercise test.
