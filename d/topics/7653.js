Some specific cytogenetic abnormalities are closely, and sometimes uniquely, associated with morphologically and clinically distinct subsets of leukemia or lymphoma, as well as with their prognosis.</p><p>Because of the ease of obtaining and processing bone marrow or peripheral blood samples, more information is available about the relationship between cytogenetic abnormalities and the pathogenesis and natural history of the leukemias than for other malignancies.

The importance of these cytogenetic abnormalities in individual disease states is discussed in detail in the appropriate topic reviews. A review of the available cytogenetic diagnostic tools is also available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromosomal abnormalities are described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following terminology will be used in this review.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal cells have 46 chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes, X or Y). The male karyotype is 46,XY and the female is 46,XX.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trisomy is the gain of an extra chromosome (eg, trisomy of chromosome 8 is denoted +8).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monosomy is a form of genetic loss (also seen in deletions) in which an entire chromosome is lost. As an example, deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 is denoted as del(7q) and monosomy for chromosome 7 as -7.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal translocation (t) is the process by which a break occurs in the DNA in at least two different chromosomes, with exchange of genetic material between the chromosomes. Reciprocal or balanced translocation refers to an exchange in which there is no obvious overall loss of chromosomal material. An example of a reciprocal translocation is the rearrangement giving rise to the Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22), seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Standard notation for reciprocal translocations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal deletion (del) results in the loss of chromosomal material. A deletion results from two breaks in either the short arm (p) or long arm (q) of the chromosome, with the loss of intervening material (interstitial deletion). An example of an interstitial deletion is the myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q) (formerly known as the 5q- syndrome), in which a variable portion of the long arm of chromosome 5 is lost. A loss of genetic material also occurs as a result of loss of an entire chromosome (monosomy, see above), or from other structural abnormalities, such as unbalanced translocations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H256828282\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytogenetics and molecular genetics of myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Deletions of chromosome 5'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal inversion (inv) requires two breaks in the same chromosome with rotation of the intervening material. An example is the inv(16)(p13.1q22). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H993131070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytogenetics in acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Inv(16) and t(16;16)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal bands are alternating light and dark segments due to various staining procedures. The banding pattern of each chromosome is unique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A recurring abnormality is a numerical or structural abnormality noted in multiple patients who have a similar disease. Such abnormalities are characteristic or diagnostic of distinct subtypes of leukemia or lymphoma that have unique morphological <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunophenotypic features. Many recurring abnormalities have prognostic significance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard notation for reciprocal translocations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, chromosomal translocation (t) is the process by which a break occurs in the DNA in at least two different chromosomes, with exchange of genetic material between the chromosomes. Reciprocal or balanced translocation refers to an exchange in which there is no obvious overall loss of chromosomal material. An example of a reciprocal translocation is the t(9;22) seen in CML, giving rise to the Philadelphia chromosome.</p><p>In the case of the Philadelphia chromosome, the most common (reciprocal) translocation is between the long arm of chromosome 9 at band q34.1 (9q34.1) and the long arm of chromosome 22 at band q11.2 (22q11.2). Standard nomenclature is to designate the involved chromosomes in the first set of parentheses and the breakpoints in a second set. Thus, this specific translocation would be denoted as t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62227\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62227 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>This chromosomal rearrangement yields a shortened chromosome 22, denoted as der(22), and results in the translocation of the ABL1 proto-oncogene, located at 9q34.1, to a position adjacent to the <em>BCR</em> gene, located at 22q11.2. Sometimes a three-way translocation can occur [eg, t(9;22;17)], but <em>ABL1</em> is always juxtaposed with <em>BCR</em> in CML. This gives rise to the chimeric <em>BCR-ABL1</em> gene, the product of which (the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein) has increased tyrosine kinase activity and has been implicated in the malignant transformation to CML. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Novel fusion proteins'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'The Philadelphia chromosome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of clonality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature, an abnormal clone is identified if one of the following is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least two cells with the same structural rearrangement (eg, translocations, deletions, or inversions) or gain of the same chromosome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three cells, each of which shows loss of the same chromosome</p><p/><p>One cell with a normal karyotype is considered evidence for the presence of a normal cell line. One abnormal cell is usually not considered evidence for an abnormal clone, since sporadic numerical abnormalities (primarily chromosome loss) may result from technical artifact. An exception to this general rule is a single cell with a well characterized recurring abnormality (eg, one cell with a Philadelphia chromosome), which probably represents the karyotype of the malignant cells in that patient, or a single cell in a post-treatment sample with one or more aberrations observed in the pre-treatment sample. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Remission criteria in acute myeloid leukemia and monitoring for residual disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION OF TUMOR SPECIMENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytogenetic analyses of malignant diseases must be based on direct evaluation of the tumor cells. Among patients with lymphoma, tissue can be obtained from involved lymph nodes, tumor mass specimens, or malignant effusions. For patients with leukemia, the specimen is usually obtained by bone marrow aspiration or, if necessary, bone marrow biopsy. Alternatively, a sample of peripheral blood may be used for the cell cultures for patients with leukemia who have a white blood cell count higher than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> with more than 10 percent immature myeloid or lymphoid cells. In this setting, the karyotype of the dividing cells in the blood generally reflects that of cells obtained from the bone marrow.</p><p>The specimen is processed immediately, typically by culturing for 24 to 48 hours. Mitosis-inducing substances (mitogens) such as phytohemagglutinin are not generally used when culturing specimens (bone marrow or peripheral blood) from patients with acute leukemia, since stimulation of division of normal lymphocytes may interfere with the analysis of spontaneously dividing malignant cells. In contrast, T or B cell specific mitogens may be used in culturing cells from lymphoid neoplasms, particularly low-grade T and B cell neoplasms, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Obtaining the sample</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytogenetic studies can be performed only on specimens that contain viable dividing cells; samples of blood, bone marrow, or tumor immersed in preservatives or fixatives cannot be used. Blood or bone marrow (5 mL) should be aspirated into a syringe coated with preservative-free heparin, and transferred to a tube containing an appropriate culture medium. Other anticoagulants, such as EDTA, which chelates calcium, should be avoided in the collection medium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: Indications and technique&quot;, section on 'Materials'</a>.)</p><p>It is critical that the specimen be transported at room temperature to the cytogenetics laboratory without delay. For optimally handled specimens, 95 to 98 percent should be adequate for cytogenetic analysis. Although cytogenetic analyses can be performed on specimens that have been transported by overnight delivery services, there is frequent loss of cell viability with a high proportion of inadequate analyses. Other methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be performed on fixed samples or on blood or marrow smears if one knows in advance which aberration to probe for. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'FISH'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reaction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods of detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytogenetic abnormalities may be detected using conventional metaphase cytogenetic analysis, FISH analysis, RT-PCR, microarray-based gene expression profiling, genomic copy number analysis, or DNA or RNA sequencing.</p><p>Conventional cytogenetic analysis of human tumors is often technically difficult because of the presence of multiple abnormal cell lines, the complexity of the chromosomal pattern, and the requirement for highly skilled personnel. These factors have led investigators to seek alternative methods for identifying chromosomal abnormalities, such as FISH or RT-PCR analysis of RNA from tumor cells.</p><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques can be incorporated into the diagnostic evaluation of leukemia and lymphoma, and allow the detection of recurring gene fusion transcripts and gene mutations with high sensitivity. Targeted or whole RNA level NGS can precisely detect recurring leukemia-specific gene fusion transcripts, or identify novel gene fusions that define specific leukemia entities, such as BCR-ABL1-like B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. NGS analysis of DNA using gene panels of targeted exon mutations has become part of the routine diagnostic procedures in clinical laboratories for hematologic malignancies, and allows better risk stratification and selection of targeted therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction'</a>.)</p><p>However, molecular methods, such as RT-PCR or NGS techniques assess the entire cell population, whereas FISH provides analysis at the single cell level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1070126543\"><span class=\"h3\">Metaphase cytogenetic analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional metaphase cytogenetic analysis is technically difficult, but allows for the examination of the entire tumor genome. This is of particular importance for the evaluation of hematologic malignancies that have many potential genetic abnormalities (eg, acute myeloid leukemia). To perform chromosome analysis by metaphase analysis, the tumor sample is typically cultured in vitro without mitogens that stimulate cellular division. Once the cells divide readily, a chemical is added to arrest mitotic division in metaphase. Chromosomal banding is then performed using various enzymes and histological stains. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H15538624\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Chromosomal analysis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">FISH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, labeled DNA probes are hybridized to either metaphase chromosomes or interphase nuclei, and the hybridized probes are detected with fluorochromes. This technique is a rapid and sensitive means of detecting recurring numerical and structural abnormalities.</p><p>FISH is dependent on the ability of single-stranded DNA to anneal to complementary DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The target DNA is the nuclear DNA of interphase cells or the DNA of metaphase chromosomes that are affixed to a glass microscope slide. FISH can also be accomplished with bone marrow or peripheral blood smears, freshly prepared touch preparations, cytospin slides, or fixed and sectioned tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H15538631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization'</a>.)</p><p>Commercially available probes are typically several hundred kilobase bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, directly labeled with fluorochrome, and are hybridized to the target DNA. Often several BAC probes spanning &gt;1 megabase of DNA are pooled. With the development of dual- and triple-pass filters, most laboratories now have the capacity to hybridize and detect two to three probes simultaneously.</p><p>In general, there are three types of probes that are used to detect chromosomal abnormalities by FISH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Centromere-specific probes, unique to the repetitive sequences that flank the centromere of each human chromosome, have been used to identify monosomy, trisomy, and other aneuploidies in both leukemias and solid tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locus-specific probes, such as the <em>BCR</em> and <em>ABL1</em> probes. These are usually BAC clones flanking the entire or a partial genomic region of the relevant gene, labeled in single- or dual-color. This type of probe is very useful in detecting genomic aberrations, such as translocations or inversions, as well as deletions or gain of gene copy number. Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, this technique can be used to detect the presence of residual disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosome-specific libraries, which paint the entire chromosome, chromosome arm, or specific chromosomal bands, are particularly useful in identifying marker chromosomes (rearranged chromosomes of unidentified origin) or structural rearrangements, such as translocations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FISH can be used to detect allele loss in tumor cells, such as deletion of the TP53 gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>In some cases, FISH is more sensitive than morphological and conventional cytogenetic analyses (such as analysis of Giemsa banded metaphase chromosomes to detect the Philadelphia chromosome). FISH is most useful when the analysis is targeted towards those abnormalities that are known to be associated with a particular tumor or disease. Thus, in the clinical setting, complete cytogenetic analysis can be performed at the time of diagnosis to identify the chromosomal abnormalities in the malignant cells of a particular patient. FISH with the appropriate probes can then be used to detect residual disease or early relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>], and to assess the efficacy of therapeutic regimens.</p><p>FISH can be used as the primary method of confirming the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies with distinctive morphology such as acute promyelocytic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia. However, additional abnormalities or multiple clones will not be detected by this method alone. Therefore, the FISH technique serves in most clinical cases as a complement to conventional cytogenetic analysis.</p><p>FISH probes are available for the detection of all of the common recurring chromosomal abnormalities in hematologic malignant diseases, including chromosome gains or losses, deletions and translocations. FISH probes are available that distinguish the different chromosome 22 breakpoints among patients with the Philadelphia chromosome and the <em>BCR-ABL1</em> fusion gene. This distinction can also be made using different primer sets from the three principal <em>BCR</em> breakpoint regions and RT-PCR techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Detecting the Philadelphia chromosome or its products'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can markedly increase the sensitivity of detection of chromosomal abnormalities. PCR can detect abnormalities in marrow or blood samples at a level of 1 in 10<sup>5</sup> to 1 in 10<sup>6</sup> normal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Translocations that result in fusion genes are especially suited for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), a technique in which the fusion mRNA is copied into cDNA and then, with appropriate primers from each gene, the fusion gene is amplified by PCR. The identity of the amplified product can be confirmed by DNA sequencing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction'</a>.)</p><p>The high sensitivity of PCR means that patients in clinical remission can be tested to detect minimal residual disease. It is possible, however, that the sensitivity is too high to be clinically applicable. It is not yet known whether patients in clinical remission who are persistently positive by sensitive PCR methods are always destined to relapse (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Quantitative changes'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. On the other hand, it seems likely that patients who are negative by current PCR methods are cured of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Microarray technology has enabled high-resolution genome-wide genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This technology facilitates genome-wide association studies for the identification of disease susceptibility loci, as well as the identification of acquired abnormalities, such as genetic imbalances (eg, cryptic deletions and duplications, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) that occurs without concurrent changes in the gene copy number) which can be attributed to somatic mitotic recombination (referred to as copy-neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy).</p><p>Several studies have validated the diagnostic utility of this technology, and many laboratories offer this test as an adjunct to cytogenetic and FISH analysis for genomic profiling of individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a genomic analysis of clonal origins of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), it was found that genomic abnormalities contributing to ALL relapse are selected for during initial treatment, perhaps pointing to new targets for therapeutic intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of targeted gene fusions or mutations has become feasible for routine clinical laboratory tests in both myeloid and lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma. These techniques are highly sensitive at single nucleotide resolution and allow the analysis of multiple genes in a panel reaction. RNA-based NGS assays detect various recurring chromosome translocations and gene fusions in leukemia and lymphoma, and may reveal novel gene fusions that are therapeutically targetable, such as multiple tyrosine kinase gene fusions in Ph-like B-ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The detection of specific chromosome <span class=\"nowrap\">translocations/gene</span> fusions enable a precise diagnosis of leukemia, whereas the detection of recurring gene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and ALL provides important genetic information regarding prognosis, and informs the selection of targeted therapies. Combining conventional cytogenetic analysis, FISH tests, microarray, and NGS studies offers an informative genetic landscape of leukemia or lymphoma, and enables personalized genetic-based treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC CONSEQUENCES OF CHROMOSOMAL TRANSLOCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in the expression of the genes that are located at the breakpoints of the chromosomal translocations or in the properties of the encoded proteins play an important role in the process of malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

Although the t(9;22) may be the initiating event in CML, progression to blast crisis is often accompanied by the acquisition of other chromosomal changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/20,24,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,38</a>].

Some specific cytogenetic abnormalities are closely, and sometimes uniquely, associated with morphologically and clinically distinct subsets of leukemia or lymphoma, as well as with their prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytogenetic analyses are based upon the direct evaluation of the tumor cells. Among patients with lymphoma, tissue can be obtained from involved lymph nodes, tumor mass specimens, or malignant effusions. For patients with leukemia, analyses can be performed on material from a bone marrow aspiration, bone marrow biopsy or a sample of peripheral blood. The specimen is typically cultured for 24 to 48 hours. Conventional cytogenetic studies can be performed only on specimens that contain viable dividing cells; samples of blood, bone marrow, or tumor immersed in preservatives or fixatives cannot be used. Blood or bone marrow (5 mL) should be aspirated into a syringe coated with preservative-free heparin, and transferred to a tube containing an appropriate culture medium. It is critical that the specimen be transported at room temperature to the cytogenetics laboratory without delay. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining the sample'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytogenetic abnormalities may be detected using conventional metaphase cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), microarray-based genomic copy number analysis, or DNA or RNA sequencing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conventional metaphase cytogenetic analysis is technically difficult, but allows for the examination of the entire tumor genome. This is of particular importance in the evaluation of hematologic malignancies that have many potential genetic abnormalities (eg, acute myeloid leukemia). (See <a href=\"#H1070126543\" class=\"local\">'Metaphase cytogenetic analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>FISH is a rapid and sensitive method of detecting recurring numerical and structural abnormalities. FISH is most useful when the analysis is targeted toward those abnormalities that are known to be associated with a particular tumor or disease. However, additional abnormalities or multiple clones will not be detected by this method alone. Therefore, the FISH technique serves in most clinical cases as a complement to conventional cytogenetic analysis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'FISH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>RT-PCR has high sensitivity and is ideally suited to detect fusion genes. The identity of the amplified product can be confirmed by DNA sequencing. The high sensitivity of RT-PCR means that patients in clinical remission can be tested to detect minimal residual disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reaction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genomic microarray technology using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) allows genome-wide association studies for the identification of disease susceptibility loci, and the identification of acquired abnormalities, such as genomic imbalances (eg, cryptic deletions and duplications), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) that occurs without concurrent changes in the gene copy number as copy-neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy. Numerous studies have validated the diagnostic utility of this technology in hematologic malignancies; however, this technology is generally suboptimal for the detection of the balanced chromosome translocations or inversions. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Microarray analysis and sequencing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in the expression of the genes that are located at the breakpoints of the chromosomal translocations or in the properties of the encoded proteins play an important role in the process of malignant transformation. Of these, genes that encode proteins that regulate transcription are the most commonly involved. There are several mechanisms by which chromosomal translocations result in altered gene function, such as impaired regulation of gene expression and expression of a novel fusion protein. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of altered gene function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specific clinical use of cytogenetic analyses differs among hematologic malignancies. Cytogenetic studies are used to confirm certain diagnoses (eg, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute prolymphocytic leukemia); to predict the clinical course and the likelihood of responding to particular treatments (eg, acute myeloid leukemia); to detect minimal residual disease and assess treatment response; and to identify transformation to more aggressive disease.
