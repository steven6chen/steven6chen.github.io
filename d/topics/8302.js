Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs all over the body that make and store cells that fight infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63854 \">figure 1</a>). These infection-fighting cells are also called &quot;white blood cells.&quot;</p><p>When people have lymphoma, their white blood cells become abnormal, grow out of control, and travel to different parts of the body. The abnormal cells often collect in small, bean-shaped organs called lymph nodes. This causes the lymph nodes to swell.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6934019\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with Hodgkin lymphoma first notice a swollen, painless lymph node in the neck. People can also have swollen lymph nodes above the collar bone, or in the armpit or groin.</p><p>Lymph nodes deeper in the body can become swollen and cause symptoms. For example, swollen lymph nodes in the chest can cause a cough, trouble breathing, or chest pain.</p><p>Some people can also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Night sweats that soak their clothes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6934026\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Hodgkin lymphoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will also do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lymph node biopsy &ndash; A doctor will remove one of the swollen lymph nodes. Then another doctor will look at the cells under a microscope to see if cancer cells are present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6934033\"><span class=\"h1\">What is lymphoma staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoma staging is a way in which doctors find out how far the lymphoma has spread in the lymphatic system or in the body.</p><p>Hodgkin lymphoma usually starts in lymph nodes in the neck or chest. If the cancer spreads, it usually spreads to nearby lymph nodes, and then to organs such as the spleen or liver.</p><p>To check how far your Hodgkin lymphoma has spread, your doctor will do an exam, blood tests, and an imaging test, such as a CT or PET scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. </p><p>Your doctor might also do a bone marrow biopsy. For this test, a doctor will take a small sample of bone marrow (the tissue in the center of your bones). Another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if it has cancer.</p><p>The right treatment for you depends a lot on the stage of your Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6934040\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Hodgkin lymphoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Doctors can use different chemotherapy medicines to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. Your doctor will work with you to choose the ones that are right for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p>People whose Hodgkin lymphoma doesn't get better with treatment or comes back after treatment might have a bone marrow transplant. This is also called a &quot;stem cell transplant.&quot; This treatment replaces cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation.</p><p>Most of the time, Hodgkin lymphoma can be cured with treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6934047\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma can increase a person's chance of getting another type of cancer in the future. For example, women who get radiation therapy to the chest can have an increased chance of getting breast cancer years later. Talk with your doctor about what you can do to check for or prevent other cancers in the future. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6934054\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for Hodgkin lymphoma involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when. </p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks to this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6934061\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lymphoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hodgkin lymphoma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hodgkin lymphoma in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
