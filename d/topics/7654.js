Similarly, several randomized trials have shown the efficacy of these agents in patients with peripheral SpA, including patients who have failed to respond to a traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-guidelines-for-use-of-anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-agents-in-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-in-peripheral-and-non-radiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Other than recognized medical contraindications to anti-TNF therapy (eg, untreated latent tuberculosis, active infection, and moderate or severe heart failure), there are no convincing evidence-based indications to exclude any patients with AS from such treatment. However, the very high cost of these therapies is a major impediment to their more widespread use in symptomatic SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-guidelines-for-use-of-anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-agents-in-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-in-peripheral-and-non-radiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. To control healthcare costs, government agencies and health insurance payers have imposed restrictions on the use of these agents. These policies vary by payer. In some countries, such as the US, each health payer formulates its own rules regarding patient characteristics that are required to have the cost of anti-TNF therapy covered.</p><p>The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) working group, an international organization of more than 100 experts from a variety of countries, first published a set of guidelines for use of anti-TNF agents in axial SpA in 2003, updated them in 2006 and 2010, and published a literature review in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-guidelines-for-use-of-anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-agents-in-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-in-peripheral-and-non-radiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. The guidelines address patient selection, monitoring, and discontinuation of these drugs in patients with AS and other axial SpA, including nr-axSpA. The ASAS guidelines represent an opinion of the majority of ASAS members. Although some questions have been raised in the context of these recommendations, they provide general guidelines that are helpful in making decisions regarding individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-guidelines-for-use-of-anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-agents-in-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-in-peripheral-and-non-radiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Most other guidelines (eg, from individual countries) use a similar approach to the ASAS guidelines. Many of the existing guidelines define practice for a particular region or for the patients covered by a particular payer. Thus, clinicians in each region need to consult the regulatory or insurance guidelines of their own country, region, insurer, or other payer to determine the criteria that patients must meet to have anti-TNF therapies approved by the responsible agency or insurer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-guidelines-for-use-of-anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-agents-in-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-in-peripheral-and-non-radiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the ASAS guidelines for cost-conscious use of TNF inhibitors in patients with AS and nr-axSpA, and addresses additional related issues.

These radiographically negative axial SpA patients with axial symptoms were designated previously as having undifferentiated SpA or &ldquo;early ankylosing spondylitis,&rdquo; but these terms have been replaced by the term &ldquo;non-radiographic axial SpA&rdquo; (nr-axSpA) because patients do not necessarily progress to develop the characteristic changes of classic AS. There are also a very small number of patients with early axial SpA who show only MRI changes of inflammation in the spine but do not fulfill ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-guidelines-for-use-of-anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-agents-in-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-in-peripheral-and-non-radiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The consensus of these experts is that patients who are being considered for anti-TNF therapy should have a clinical diagnosis of AS or axial SpA according to formal classification criteria. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only patients with active disease, who have failed to respond to at least two different nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during four weeks of treatment, should be considered candidates for treatment with anti-TNF agents. Disease activity should be assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) score, as well as a clinician assessment. A BASDAI score of &ge;4 (on a scale of 0 to 10) or an ASDAS score of &gt;2.1 is indicative of active disease that warrants consideration of anti-TNF therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Active disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'BASDAI score'</a> above and <a href=\"#H450224396\" class=\"local\">'ASDAS score'</a> above and <a href=\"#H275545870\" class=\"local\">'Clinician assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2444368\" class=\"local\">'Prior therapeutic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with predominantly peripheral arthritis should generally have had an unsuccessful therapeutic trial of at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), preferably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, prior to the use of a TNF inhibitor. Additionally, glucocorticoid injection of one or more symptomatic peripheral joints or enthesitis sites is warranted before initiating anti-TNF therapy.
