It is sometimes called &quot;radiofrequency catheter ablation,&quot; &quot;cryothermal ablation,&quot; or &quot;cold ablation.&quot; This procedure is done in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834301\"><span class=\"h1\">How do normal heartbeats happen?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal heartbeat happens when an electrical signal starts in one spot near the top of the heart. This electrical signal follows a path to spread across the heart. As it spreads, the signal causes the heart muscle to squeeze. Each time the heart squeezes (&quot;beats&quot;), blood is sent all over the body. Normally, the heart beats in a regular way 60 to 80 times a minute.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834308\"><span class=\"h1\">What can cause the heart to beat too fast?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heart can beat too fast when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electrical signal starts in the wrong part of the heart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electrical signal follows the wrong path as it spreads across the heart</p><p/><p>People with heart problems as well as those with healthy hearts can have heartbeats that are too fast.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834315\"><span class=\"h1\">How does catheter ablation work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter ablation destroys the part of the heart that is creating or spreading abnormal electrical signals. After the procedure, the heart can beat normally again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834322\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I get ready for the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will tell you what to do to get ready for the procedure. For example, you might need to stop taking certain medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834329\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the procedure starts you will get medicines to make you sleepy. Then the doctor will insert a thin tube called a &quot;catheter&quot; into a large blood vessel in your leg or another part of your body. Next he or she will guide the catheter into your heart. Using wires that are inside the catheter, the doctor will try to destroy the small parts of the heart causing the fast heartbeat. At the end of the procedure, the doctor removes the catheter and wires.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834336\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the procedure, your doctor or nurse will tell you which medicines you should take. He or she will also tell you which activities you should avoid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834343\"><span class=\"h1\">What are some downsides of the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Downsides of the procedure can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding, bruising, or getting an infection in the area where the catheter was put in</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to the heart from the wires</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the heartbeat &ndash; Some people who have changes in their heartbeat might need to have a pacemaker put in. A pacemaker is a device that can keep a person's heartbeat normal. It is put under the skin in the upper chest and has wires that connect to the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots that form and then travel to the lungs or brain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834350\"><span class=\"h1\">Is catheter ablation the only treatment for a fast heartbeat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Doctors can use other treatments for a fast heartbeat. These can include medicines, other procedures, or surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26834420\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-abnormal-heartbeats-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for abnormal heartbeats (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
