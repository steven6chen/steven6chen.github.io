Patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia who require mechanical ventilation after the onset of infection do not meet the definition of VAP. VAP is a common and serious problem in the intensive care unit that is associated with an increased risk of death. Accurate diagnosis is important so that appropriate treatment can be instituted early while simultaneously avoiding antibiotic overuse and consequently, antibiotic resistance.</p><p>The clinical presentation and diagnosis of VAP are reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk factors for VAP as well as its prevention and treatment are discussed separately.

In particular, fever and respiratory distress are common among intubated patients with a wide variety of etiologies that must also be considered.

A diagnosis of VAP cannot be made without the identification of an infiltrate on chest imaging, particularly one where the filtrate is new or progressive. Common radiographic abnormalities in VAP include alveolar infiltrates, air bronchograms, and silhouetting of adjacent solid organs. The chest radiograph can also help determine the severity of the disease (multilobar versus unilobar) and identify complications, such as pleural effusions or cavitation. </p><p>A normal radiograph, which is unusual in ventilated individuals, lowers the suspicion for VAP. Chest CT may be appropriate to detect an infiltrate in this setting (eg, patients with fever plus leukocytosis and purulent tracheobronchial secretions). CT may also be appropriate in those with a previous CT diagnosis of pneumonia to look for new or progressive changes. </p><p>Chest imaging abnormalities alone are insufficient to diagnose VAP because the findings are nonspecific (ie, imaging is frequently abnormal even in the absence of VAP). This was illustrated by an observational study in which only 43 percent of patients who had clinical and radiographic evidence of VAP at the time of their death were subsequently confirmed to have VAP by postmortem examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2756495\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2632276373\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect ventilator-associated pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VAP should be suspected in patients with a new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate on imaging PLUS supportive clinical findings of infection (eg, fever, secretions, leukocytosis) (see <a href=\"#H340210395\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above).

However, not uncommonly, severe illness or delays in sampling requires that empiric antibiotic therapy be initiated prior to diagnostic sampling. Nonetheless, once respiratory specimens have been obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy is indicated for suspected VAP, targeting the suspected organism using local antibiograms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109525\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109525 \">algorithm 1</a>), the details of which are discussed separately.

However, experts disagree on how the respiratory sample should be obtained (invasive versus noninvasive sampling) and whether or not cultures should be quantitative or nonquantitative. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4131106291\"><span class=\"h4\">Our preferred approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors favor the approach set out by the 2017 guidelines issued by The European Respiratory Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ERS)/European</span> Society of Intensive Care Medicine <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESCIM)/European</span> Society of Clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">Microbiology/Infectious</span> Diseases <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESCMID)/Asociaci&oacute;n</span> Latinoamericana del T&oacute;rax (ALAT), which state a preference for invasive sampling methods (eg, mini-bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchoscopic BAL, or protected specimen brush [PSB]) with quantitative cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This preference is based upon the high value that we place on diagnostic accuracy and the potential to reduce antibiotic exposure, thereby promoting good antibiotic stewardship when compared with noninvasive sampling (ie, endotracheal aspiration) and nonquantitative cultures. In contrast, other experts prefer the approach set forth by The Infectious Diseases Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">America/The</span> American Thoracic Society, which state a preference for noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative cultures for the diagnosis of VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]; this preference is based upon evidence that demonstrates no difference in mortality or length of stay with either approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1484279637\" class=\"local\">'Alternative approach'</a> below.)</p><p>However, practice varies widely and is often institution-, physician-, and patient-specific. The wide variation in practice is partially explained by a lack of gold standard for the diagnosis of VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and differences in opinion regarding the relative importance of specific clinical outcomes (mortality, length of stay, antibiotic resistance). Additional factors include the ability of the patient to tolerate invasive sampling, and the presence of other indications for bronchoscopy (eg, endobronchial obstruction, bleeding, cancer, invasive pneumonia in an immunosuppressed patient, suspicion for a second organism [eg, patients with bronchiectasis], noninvasive methods are unhelpful), available expertise, and institutional availability and cost of quantitative cultures. As an example, while bronchoscopy may be preferred in an immunosuppressed patient with hemoptysis, endotracheal aspiration may be preferred in patients in whom the suspicion for VAP is low or in whom the risk of bronchoscopy is high (eg, patients with barotrauma, high peak pressures, severe hypoxemia). (See <a href=\"#H2574377441\" class=\"local\">'Society guideline links'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2673132852\"><span class=\"h5\">Invasive respiratory sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive methods of sampling generally involve nonbronchoscopic methods (eg, mini-BAL) or a bronchoscopic methods (eg, bronchoscopic BAL or PSB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/13-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-21</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopic BAL is our preferred method of lower respiratory tract sampling. The rationale for this approach is that BAL, compared with PSB (and probably mini-BAL), is a larger sample that obtains a dominant alveolar component with minimal airway contamination. When compared with noninvasive sampling techniques (endotracheal aspirates), bronchoscopic sampling has been shown in several studies to reduce antibiotic overuse and result in more rapid de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy without impacting mortality or length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2724942608\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below). A larger sample is also especially helpful in immunocompromised patients where additional microbiologic studies are typically warranted. In addition, cytospin and differential cell count can be performed on BAL fluid which may be helpful in non-neutropenic hosts where the identification of less than 50 percent neutrophils would make acute bacterial pneumonia unlikely. Additional advantages include the ability to inspect the airways for purulence and exclude conditions like malignancy and hemorrhage. PSB is an alternative to BAL. Rarely, both BAL and PSB are obtained, in which case many experts do the PSB first. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BAL involves the infusion and aspiration of sterile saline through a flexible bronchoscope that is wedged in an affected bronchial segmental or subsegmental orifice (eg, fourth order bronchus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104076\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076 \">figure 1</a>)). The technique of bronchoscopy and BAL are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-preparation-procedural-technique-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Preparation, procedural technique, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PSB is a brush that is contained within a protective sheath, which minimizes the likelihood that the brush will be contaminated during bronchoscopy. The procedure involves placing the bronchoscope tip next to the affected bronchial segmental orifice, pushing the sheath through the bronchoscope under direct visual guidance, and then advancing the brush out of the sheath and into the airway. Specimens are collected by brushing the airway wall, withdrawing the brush into the sheath, and then removing the sheath from the bronchoscope. The distal end of brush can be cut and sent for microscopic analysis and culture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One disadvantage of bronchoscopic sampling is that it is only performed by physicians with expertise in the procedure and cannot be performed by ancillary staff. In addition, it is more invasive and ventilated patients are at risk of complications including worsening hypoxemia and barotrauma. However, indirect data suggest that the invasive approach incurs minimal added risk to the patient, although these data are likely influenced by selection bias in favor of bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mini-BAL is performed by advancing a catheter through the endotracheal tube blindly until resistance is met, infusing sterile saline through the catheter (typically three 50 mL aliquots) and then aspirating using the syringe (the catheter is estimated to be located in the distal endobronchial airway (eg, second or third order bronchus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104076\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076 \">figure 1</a>)). We generally reserve mini-BAL for those in whom bronchoscopy is too risky or not available. This procedure requires less expertise and training than bronchoscopy and it is often performed by ancillary staff (eg, nurses and respiratory therapists) rather than clinicians. Complications are rare but include hypoxemia, endobronchial perforation, and barotrauma. While mini-BAL samples are likely to be less contaminated by the airway than endotracheal aspirates, they are less likely to contain a deep alveolar sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/15,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4034120423\"><span class=\"h5\">Microscopic analysis and quantitative culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All respiratory tract samples should be sent for microscopic analysis and our preference is that quantitative cultures be obtained: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microscopic analysis</strong> &ndash; This involves semi-quantitative analysis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other cell types, as well as the Gram stain.

The presence of abundant neutrophils is consistent with VAP and the bacterial morphology may suggest a likely pathogen (eg, Gram-negative rods). In a prospective cohort study of 39 patients who underwent BAL, VAP was correctly excluded in all patients in whom neutrophils were fewer than 50 percent of the total nucleated cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quantitative cultures</strong> &ndash; Bacteria can be counted on any respiratory specimen.

This was best illustrated in a meta-analysis of three randomized trials (1240 patients), which found that semiquantitative cultures from noninvasive samples did not alter mortality, days of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, or antibiotic use when compared with quantitative invasive strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, many of the included studies did not use a de-escalation strategy for antimicrobials which may have biased the data favoring the noninvasive strategy. </p><p>Endotracheal aspiration typically has the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of VAP but lower specificity when compared with invasive strategies, which may potentially lead to the over diagnosis and over treatment of VAP; these data are discussed above.

Pulmonary hemorrhage tends to present with frank bleeding while VAP often appears as blood mixed with purulent secretions, but this distinction is imperfect. Definitively distinguishing pulmonary hemorrhage from VAP requires that the cause of the hemoptysis be identified, typically on bronchoscopy.

The former develops approximately 4 to 12 weeks after irradiation, with symptoms and signs that mimic VAP; it is distinguished from VAP by history (ie, prior irradiation) and negative microscopic analysis and culture of respiratory secretions.

The clinical manifestations of pulmonary drug toxicity can be identical to VAP and the timing of the onset of symptoms and signs is highly variable (ie, days to months after receiving the medication). Pulmonary drug toxicity is distinguished from VAP by history (ie, received a potentially toxic agent within the past months) and negative microscopic analysis and culture of respiratory secretions.

Patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia who require mechanical ventilation after the onset of infection do not meet the definition of VAP. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VAP typically presents with the gradual or sudden onset of a new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate on imaging and supportive clinical findings of infection including fever, purulent tracheobronchial secretions, leukocytosis, increased respiratory rate, decreased tidal volume, increased minute ventilation, and decreased oxygenation. Clinical features alone are nonspecific for the diagnosis of VAP. (See <a href=\"#H340210395\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected VAP, most experts agree that the lower respiratory tract should be sampled and peripheral blood cultures should be sent obtained <strong>prior</strong> to the initiation of antibiotics or change of antibiotic therapy (in those already receiving antibiotics). Once the respiratory specimens have been obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should be administered. (See <a href=\"#H132997803\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory tract sampling'</a> above and <a href=\"#H358470086\" class=\"local\">'Timing of sampling and empiric antibiotics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experts disagree on how the respiratory sample should be obtained (invasively or noninvasively) and whether or not cultures should be quantitative or nonquantitative. No approach has demonstrated superiority over the other with regards to clinical outcomes including mortality or length of stay. (See <a href=\"#H826097128\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory tract sample type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We favor invasive sampling methods (eg, mini-bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchoscopic BAL, or protected specimen brush [PSB]) with quantitative cultures rather than noninvasive sampling (ie, endotracheal aspiration) with nonquantitative cultures. This preference is based upon the high value that we place on diagnostic accuracy and the potential to reduce antibiotic exposure, thereby promoting good antibiotic stewardship. (See <a href=\"#H4131106291\" class=\"local\">'Our preferred approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative cultures is an acceptable alternative approach.

VAP cannot be confirmed or excluded until the culture results are complete, which generally takes two to three days.
