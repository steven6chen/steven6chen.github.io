A trauma is an intense event that involves serious injury or death, or the chance of serious injury or death. This can include medical events, such as a heart attack, surgery, or treatment in a hospital's intensive care unit (&quot;ICU&quot;). PTSD can cause nightmares, upsetting memories, anxiety, and other symptoms.</p><p>Not everyone who sees or lives through a trauma will get PTSD. Doctors do not know why some people get PTSD and others don't.</p><p>PTSD can happen at any age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30116664\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PTSD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of PTSD include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reliving the trauma through thoughts and feelings &ndash; People can have upsetting memories, nightmares, or flashbacks. Flashbacks are when people &quot;see&quot; or feel the trauma over and over again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling &quot;numb&quot; and avoiding certain people or places &ndash; People avoid thinking about the trauma and avoid people and places that remind them of it. Some people also feel &quot;numb.&quot; They might not enjoy activities they used to enjoy or feel part of the world around them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having intense feelings, such as anger, fear, or worry &ndash; People might frighten or startle easily. Many people have trouble sleeping.</p><p/><p>These symptoms can start right after the trauma. If they last longer than 3 days, they could be symptoms of a related condition called acute stress disorder (ASD). If they last longer than a month, they could be symptoms of PTSD. Sometimes, though, symptoms of PTSD start years later. The symptoms often affect a person's job, relationships, or daily life.</p><p>Symptoms of PTSD can come and go. They might return when people are under stress or see or hear something that reminds them of the trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30116687\"><span class=\"h1\">How can my doctor or nurse tell if I have PTSD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms, asking you questions, and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30116702\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PTSD treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PTSD is treated with one or both of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A type of therapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy, or &quot;CBT&quot; &ndash; CBT involves meeting with a therapist to talk about your feelings and thoughts.
