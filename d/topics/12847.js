It is also one of the most under-reported and undertreated symptoms in such patients, as well as in other palliative care populations, including those with end-stage heart failure. Fatigue has substantial adverse physical, psychosocial, and economic consequences for both patients and caregivers. However, due to its subjective nature and multidimensional causes, assessment and treatment of fatigue in the palliative settings can be complex.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the clinical evaluation and treatment of fatigue in palliative care. Although the focus is on fatigue in cancer patients receiving palliative care, the principles of assessment and management are similar in other end-stage disease states. A more extensive discussion of fatigue in patients with cancer and of the assessment and management of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), are presented elsewhere.

Demoralization is a frequent syndrome of existential distress in patients with cancer (13 to 18 percent). Early identification of this syndrome using a demoralization scale<strong> </strong>would be helpful to distinguish it from fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Psychomotor retardation involves a slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movements in an individual, while weakness is a term commonly used to describe a state of lack of physical, muscle, or motor strength.</p><p>Fatigue in palliative care settings can be broadly defined as &ldquo;a subjective state characterized by feelings of tiredness and a perception of decreased capacity for physical or mental work&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Possible contributors to fatigue in patients with advanced cancer are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F86222\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86222 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>In palliative care patients, fatigue is most often a multidimensional symptom, often with multiple causes. Correlative studies have shown an association of fatigue with pain, dyspnea, anorexia, psychological symptoms, gastroparesis symptoms (such as upper abdominal discomfort, bloating, and abdominal distension), and constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The intensity of the individual symptom in a given patient may determine the ultimate contribution of that symptom to causation of fatigue. Other major contributors are anemia and medications.

In such patients, fatigue is typically multidimensional and the main contributors are psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression, pain, cachexia, medications, physical inactivity, infection, and hypogonadism. As the severity of these factors increases progressively at the end of life, the relative contribution of anemia to the causation of fatigue diminishes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29611086\"><span class=\"h2\">Polypharmacy including opioids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications (side effects, cumulative effects of multiple drugs, and drug-drug interactions) are an often-overlooked contributor to fatigue.

The inflammatory cytokines may also induce disturbance in the hypothalamic pituitary axis, affecting the levels of corticotrophin stimulating hormone and ACTH. These hormones, in turn, may influence adrenocorticoid hormone secretion by the adrenals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29611093\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of fatigue in palliative care patients can be complex, given its multidimensional nature. In general, in cases of acute onset of fatigue in patients with a serious life-threatening illness, identification of the cause (eg, infection, cardiac decompensation), and treatment for the specific underlying condition may successfully reverse fatigue. In more chronic causes of fatigue such as that seen in patients with advanced cancer, fatigue is often multifactorial, so a multidimensional interdisciplinary approach is preferable.</p><p>A comprehensive history and physical examination should be undertaken to ascertain the various organ systems affected by the underlying disease and the impact of fatigue on activities of daily living and quality of life, to search for potentially reversible or treatable contributory factors, and to direct the diagnostic work-up. Review of all medications (both prescribed and over the counter, including <span class=\"nowrap\">complementary/alternative</span> therapies) is important and may reveal potential side effects, cumulative effect of multiple drugs, or drug-drug interactions that may be contributing to fatigue. If a medication is identified as being a potential contributor to fatigue, simply altering the dose or dosing interval may substantially improve fatigue. (See <a href=\"#H29611086\" class=\"local\">'Polypharmacy including opioids'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with cancer, accurate assessment of the patient&rsquo;s current disease status, type of treatment, and response to treatment is an important component of the initial evaluation. Factors that are often causally related to cancer-related fatigue should be specifically assessed, including anemia, uncontrolled pain, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, nutrition and electrolyte disturbances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64018\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64018 \">table 4</a>), and the presence of other comorbidities. Comorbidities that are unrelated to the cancer or its treatment (eg, infection, cardiopulmonary, renal, hepatic, neurologic, or endocrine dysfunction) may contribute significantly to symptoms of fatigue. Optimizing treatment for conditions that have been previously unrecognized (eg, hypothyroidism in a patient who previously had neck irradiation or who is receiving therapy with certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>) or suboptimally treated (eg, recurrent heart failure because of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy) may improve fatigue.</p><p>For patients with a non-cancer diagnosis, in addition to a thorough assessment of comorbidities, medications, and other potentially contributory causes, as with patients with cancer, diagnostic testing such as blood tests and radiographic imaging, may be needed, and should be based upon clinical suspicion. For patients with obvious findings due to end organ failure (eg, cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, or renal disease), the diagnostic work-up for fatigue should focus on assessment of the specific underlying cause. For cases where there are no obvious findings, physicians may evaluate for anemia, metabolic abnormalities, malnutrition, and infections. </p><p>A more in depth discussion of clinical assessment of fatigue in patients with cancer is provided elsewhere.

However, scales such as these are not useful to sort out causality. From a clinical perspective, a patient presenting with a fatigue score of &ldquo;9 out of 10&rdquo; on a 0 to 10 scale may have anemia and cachexia as the main cause, while another patient with the same intensity of fatigue may have depression as the main cause.

If a potentially treatable cause cannot be identified, treatment options include red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, or for selected patients, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). </p><p>Transfusions of packed red blood cells can improve fatigue that is due to anemia, at least in the short-term.

As an example, in one study of 4382 anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, improvement of hemoglobin &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> after treatment with an ESA was significantly correlated with improvement of fatigue, with maximum benefit occurring when the hemoglobin improved to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Although treatment of anemia has been shown to decrease fatigue in patients receiving ESAs along with palliative chemotherapy, this has not been demonstrated in other groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Furthermore, use of these agents has become controversial in certain patients with cancer, in particular those with anemia unrelated to chemotherapy and in those receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with the intent of cure, because of concerns about thromboembolic side effects, higher mortality rates, and the possibility of adverse cancer outcomes.

A randomized placebo controlled trial of 84 evaluable patients with advanced cancer, oral dexamethasone (8 mg per day for 14 days) significantly improved fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The mean (standard deviation) improvement in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue subscale (FACIT-F) at day 15 was significantly higher in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo (mean and standard deviation were 9 [10.3] versus 3.1 [9.59] for dexamethasone and placebo, respectively, p = 0.008). The numbers of grade &ge;3 adverse effects did not differ between groups (17 out of 62 versus 11 out of 58, p = 0.27).

Other suggestions for improving sleep patterns include taking a warm bath or drinking a glass of warm milk prior to bedtime, avoiding caffeinated beverages following dinner, emptying the bladder just before going to bed, and scheduling naps earlier in the day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50224 \">table 9</a>).

This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-treatment#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Cognitive-behavioral and psychosocial interventions'</a>). Further well-designed studies are needed in a broad variety of palliative care patients before this approach can be recommended in advanced serious illnesses other than cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29612237\"><span class=\"h3\">Multimodal interventions for refractory fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic treatment should be considered in all cases in which fatigue is not effectively managed by treatment of reversible causes. In these cases, due to the complex, multidimensional nature of fatigue, it is unlikely that fatigue can be effectively mitigated using a single pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic intervention. Patients are likely to benefit from a combination of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, increased physical activity, and pharmacologic therapy aimed at countering inflammation, changes in body composition, or brain function. In these cases, therapy must be individualized.</p><p>Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of the multimodal intervention in patients with fatigue, particularly those with advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. </p><p>Management of fatigue in patients receiving palliative care for a non-cancer diagnosis such as end-stage heart disease, COPD, and AIDS requires a multidimensional, interdisciplinary approach. In addition to measures to treat the causative mechanism of fatigue in these end-stage disease states (such as optimization of ejection fraction in end-stage heart disease and bronchodilators for end-stage COPD), efforts to improve <span class=\"nowrap\">function/physical</span> condition and mobility (eg, the use of assistive devices such as walkers) should be considered so as to maintain independence. Pharmacologic interventions may include trials of psychostimulants and corticosteroids. Counseling techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and expressive supportive counseling to help patients adapt to progressive disease and physical decline, and for family support, should be considered. It is important to address fatigue as a subjective symptom and not as a physical syndrome; treatment should not focus solely on strategies to increase <span class=\"nowrap\">function/physical</span> function. Lastly, patients suffer considerable distress if there is a gap between the patient&rsquo;s expectation for improved physical function through intervention and the reality of actual decline in function over time; ultimately most patients who are terminally ill will become bedridden. Measures that help adjust a patient&rsquo;s expectation may include changing the focus from physical functioning to other enjoyable, non-physical activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29611194\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue (asthenia, weakness) is the most common symptom in palliative care; it is also one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated. Untreated or undertreated fatigue significantly affects the quality of life of patients receiving palliative care; appropriate assessment and management of fatigue is essential. (See <a href=\"#H29611051\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue is a typically a multidimensional symptom. Among patients seen in a palliative care setting, acute fatigue may be due to an acute, potentially reversible medical condition (eg, cardiac decompensation, infection), while chronic fatigue, as typified by fatigue related to cancer, may have multiple contributing causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F86231\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86231 \">table 8</a>) (see <a href=\"#H4310459\" class=\"local\">'Causes and pathophysiology'</a> above). Some of the common treatable causes of fatigue in cancer patients at end of life include deconditioning, infection, dehydration, metabolic and endocrine disorders and cancer-related symptoms such as pain, anorexia, insomnia, and psychological symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Anemia is a particularly important contributor in patients undergoing cancer treatment. Anemia is a less common contributor to fatigue in cancer patients nearing the end of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intensity of fatigue can be assessed using a &ldquo;0 to 10&rdquo; visual analog scale or instruments, such as the Brief Fatigue Inventory, which measure not only intensity but also functional impact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54810 \">table 5</a>). A comprehensive history and physical examination is indicated to identify potentially reversible etiologies. Review of all medications, both prescription and over the counter, is particularly important to identify side effects and potential drug-drug interactions that may be contributing to fatigue. Simply altering the dose or dosing interval may substantially improve fatigue. (See <a href=\"#H29611086\" class=\"local\">'Polypharmacy including opioids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29611093\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When considering how to treat fatigue, a multidimensional approach is preferred. It is important to determine whether the etiology is reversible and to treat these reversible causes as best as possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F86231\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86231 \">table 8</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal management of symptomatic anemia requires an accurate diagnosis to identify potentially remediable causes (eg, ongoing blood loss, hemolysis, or deficiency of iron, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, or vitamin B12). If a potentially treatable cause cannot be identified, treatment options include red blood cell transfusion, or for selected patients (chronic kidney disease, HIV infection, patients receiving palliative chemotherapy for cancer), an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) (see <a href=\"#H29611107\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of anemia'</a> above). ESAs should not be given in patients not fitting these categories, due to the excess death risk with thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a specific cause cannot be identified, we suggest symptomatic management:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients should be counseled as to coping strategies that conserve energy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73183\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73183 \">table 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53415\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53415 \">table 11</a>), and about good sleep hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50224 \">table 9</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are in the terminal phase of their illness who have a high symptom burden that includes fatigue, we suggest a two-week trial of a glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 8 mg daily) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In our view, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> needs to be carefully considered given its modest degree of benefit and the potential for significant side effects and increased mortality. (See <a href=\"#H29611129\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29611136\" class=\"local\">'Megestrol acetate'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The role of psychostimulants is not well defined, particularly for patients with serious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life-threatening illnesses other than cancer. However, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a> is reasonable for patients with opioid-related sedation, and for patients with severe fatigue who do not respond to a glucocorticoid or megestrol or who have a contraindication to the use of these classes of drugs. (See <a href=\"#H29611151\" class=\"local\">'Psychostimulants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have moderate to severe fatigue who are undergoing active anticancer therapy, a therapeutic trial of American ginseng is reasonable as long as the patient is not receiving drugs that may interact unfavorably with ginseng, such as anticoagulants. (See <a href=\"#H29612230\" class=\"local\">'Complementary medicines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other nonpharmacologic approaches that may be helpful include moderate exercise, yoga, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, including mindfulness-based stress reduction.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Robinson S, Kissane DW, Brooker J, Burney S.
