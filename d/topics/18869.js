It is caused by mutations in the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>XLP is characterized by severe dysregulation of the immune system, often but not always in response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The three most common clinical manifestations are FIM, dysgammaglobulinemia, and lymphoma, usually of B cell origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additional presentations include lymphocytic vasculitis, aplastic anemia, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency was initially considered a form of XLP (XLP type 2, or XLP2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, after further characterization of the disorder, it appears that XIAP deficiency may be better classified as X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Other combined immunodeficiencies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combined-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combined immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>XLP is estimated to affect one to three of every million males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, the disease is probably underreported since males with fatal fulminant infectious mononucleosis (FIM) are not always evaluated for XLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There is no racial or ethnic predilection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>A worldwide XLP registry was established in 1980 as a resource for diagnosis, treatment, and research. By 1995, there were 272 males from 80 families registered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Most females who carry heterozygous mutations in the XLP gene, encoding the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP), are clinically unaffected. Random inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes during embryogenesis in females, termed Lyonization, usually leaves an adequate number of lymphocytes with active wild-type X chromosomes to prevent phenotypic disease. However, unbalanced or skewed X chromosome inactivation can lead to predominant expression of a mutated SAP allele and, therefore, clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, any condition associated with loss of an X chromosome (such as in Turner syndrome) or deletion of the part of the X chromosome containing the SAP gene can, in the presence of a mutation-bearing X chromosome, lead to clinical XLP in a female.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>XLP (MIM #308240) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP, also called Src homology 2 domain protein 1A [<em>SH2D1A</em>] or <em>DSHP</em>, MIM #300490) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] in approximately 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/3,7,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,17,18</a>], although studies have found <em>SH2D1A</em> defects in virtually all cases of XLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>].</p><p>XLP is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. De novo mutations are rare. There is a broad spectrum of <em><span class=\"nowrap\">SAP/SH2D1A</em></span> mutations that lead to abnormal or absent SAP protein expression, including deletions or insertions, single nucleotide substitutions, and splice-site abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/12,13,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,17,18</a>]. Mutations can cause early stop codons, leading to nonsense mediated decay of the mRNA message and absent SAP protein, abnormally truncated SAP protein with altered function, or destabilized protein due to misfolding or alteration of critical conserved motifs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>An important aspect of genetics concerns the relationship between genetic defects (genotypes) and clinical manifestations (disease phenotypes). There is no consistent correlation between <em>SH2D1A</em> genotypes and phenotypes in XLP, as exemplified by the observation of considerable variability in phenotype within families sharing the same genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact mechanisms underlying the clinical features of XLP remain unclear, even though a genetic defect has been identified that causes this syndrome. The clinical manifestations may be related to lack of immune surveillance for or control of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or other unidentified antigenic stimuli or due to ineffective T and natural killer (NK) cell interaction with B cells. There is dysfunction of both cellular immunity (cytotoxic T lymphocyte [CTL] and NK cell dysfunction resulting in decreased cytokine production) and humoral immunity (abnormal immunoglobulin levels and abnormal antibody responses to infections and vaccinations) in XLP. EBV infection is particularly prominent in patients with XLP, perhaps because of the B cell trophism of this virus. However, even though clinical manifestations of XLP are often triggered by EBV infection, most immunologic abnormalities seen in this disorder are not dependent upon the presence of, or prior exposure to, EBV.</p><p>Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP) is expressed in T cells, NK cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, and some B cells. SAP binds to the intracellular domains of most members of the SLAM family of receptors, which are immunoglobulin-like receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. SLAM (CD150) is a costimulatory receptor that triggers T cell activation via a protein tyrosine phosphorylation signal that is dependent upon SAP expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>]. SAP assists in the recruitment of the Src-related protein tyrosine kinase, Fyn, to SLAM and activation of Fyn. XLP-associated mutated SAP protein molecules have significantly decreased binding to SLAM peptides and to Fyn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>SAP also interacts with other members of the SLAM family, including CD84, CD229, CD244 (2B4), NTBA (NK, T, and B cell antigen), and CS1 (CD2 subset 1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These cell surface receptors are adhesion molecules that are located in the immunologic synapse regions formed between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and between NK cells and their target cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. SAP regulates these cellular interactions, which are required for normal development and function of the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, SAP plays a role in the development of T cell populations that have innate immune cell features, such as iNKT cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/13,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25-27</a>]. iNKT cells are absent in patients with SAP deficiency.</p><p>Activation of T cells via the SLAM-SAP signaling pathway can alter the profile of cytokines produced. As an example, interleukin 10 (IL-10) production by CD4+ T cells is defective in patients with XLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These T cells do not provide adequate B cell help, which may contribute to the hypogammaglobulinemia and humoral immunodeficiency seen in patients with XLP. Most immunologic abnormalities are not dependent upon the presence of or prior exposure to EBV. In addition, XLP patients are defective in generating a specific T cell subset, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thf cells are antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that are predominantly located in close proximity to follicles and germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs and express the chemokine receptor, CXCR5. These CCR5+ cells are important in the formation and maintenance of germinal centers and the establishment of memory B cells and plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The primary immune response in normal individuals infected with EBV is characterized by proliferation of CD8+ CTLs and NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There are at least three potential mechanisms to explain the abnormal response to EBV infection in patients with XLP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SAP enhances apoptosis in T and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Apoptosis plays a role in lymphocyte homeostasis and elimination of DNA-damaged cells. This important process constrains T cell expansion during antigen-induced immune responses. A decrease in apoptosis due to deficiency of SAP may underlie the intense, unchecked CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity stimulated by acute EBV infection in patients with XLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Defective apoptosis is due in part to abnormal restimulation-induced cell death (RICD), which is a self-regulatory form of apoptosis independent of EBV infection that is directly linked to the <span class=\"nowrap\">SAP/NTBA</span> signalling pathway and which may constitute a therapeutic target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another explanation for the increased cytotoxic cellular responses to EBV is that SAP-deficient CD8+ CTLs from patients with XLP manifest a failure to lyse autologous EBV-infected B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The lytic machinery normally polarizes to the area where CTLs contact EBV-infected cells, but this does not occur in SAP-deficient CTLs. Other studies have confirmed the impairment of CD8+ T cell response to EBV-transformed B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The receptor 2B4 can activate, costimulate, or inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity, depending upon its interactions with other molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/26,31,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31,41,42</a>]. SAP normally inhibits interactions between the 2B4 receptor and negative regulatory molecules. Thus, NK cell activation is inhibited by 2B4 when SAP is absent, leading to reduced NK cell lysis of EBV-infected B cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average age at presentation, usually triggered by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, is 2.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most affected individuals have no apparent disease prior to presentation, despite their immunologic abnormalities that are present prior to EBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a retrospective series of 91 patients with confirmed XLP<em>,</em> the median age of presentation was four years in patients who were EBV positive and three years in those who were EBV negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The three most common phenotypes of XLP are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fulminant infectious mononucleosis (FIM) due to an abnormal immune response to EBV infection (58 percent) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysgammaglobulinemia (22 to 31 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphoma, usually of B cell origin (30 percent)</p><p/><p>It was previously thought that these clinical manifestations of XLP always occurred as a consequence of EBV infection. However, the second and third of these manifestations can occur without prior EBV infection, suggesting that there are other stimuli that can also trigger abnormal immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/12,15,22,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,22,44</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series, 18 of 82 (22 percent) males with XLP and lymphoma had no evidence of prior EBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series of 309 males with XLP from 89 families found that 12 percent developed dysgammaglobulinemia, lymphoproliferative disease, or aplastic anemia, despite having no evidence of EBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a previously mentioned report, approximately 35 percent of patients with known EBV status were EBV negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Dysgammaglobulinemia and lymphoma were the most common disease manifestations among these patients (52 and 25 percent, respectively), while a positive family history for XLP was the most common presenting feature that prompted evaluation and diagnosis of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Fulminant infectious mononucleosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FIM is the most common clinical manifestation of XLP and also has the worst prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/6,22,43,44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22,43,44,46</a>].</p><p>EBV infection causes a dysregulated and exaggerated immune response in patients with XLP, with excessive proliferation of EBV-infected B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and macrophages in various tissues, including hematopoietic organs, liver, brain, and heart. Massive infiltration of these cells into lymphoid and other organs, in combination with abnormal cytokine release, can cause extensive parenchymal damage, including hepatic necrosis and bone marrow failure. Thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatic dysfunction, and meningoencephalitis are common in patients with FIM. Many patients develop fulminant hepatitis and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS), also referred to as acquired or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H2530801\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>FIM and HLH are sometimes listed as separate clinical manifestations of XLP. In the context of EBV infection, FIM and HLH are in essence linked entities and cannot reliably be distinguished from each other. Secondary HLH can occur without the presence of FIM if the offending virus (or infectious trigger in the broader sense) is something other than EBV, such as another herpes family virus. HLH without FIM was observed in approximately 21 percent of EBV-negative patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The minority of patients who survive FIM may have fulminant hepatitis upon re-exposure to EBV. They usually also have residual immune dysfunction, such as abnormal immunoglobulin levels (increased immunoglobulin A [IgA] or immunoglobulin M [IgM], decreased immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1] or immunoglobulin G3 [IgG3]) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired antibody responses, as well as defective natural killer (NK) cell function.</p><p>In one series<em>,</em> FIM and HLH were the most common presenting manifestations of XLP (approximately 40 percent), with an additional 6 percent developing <span class=\"nowrap\">FIM/HLH</span> at a later date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this series, the mortality of <span class=\"nowrap\">FIM/HLH</span> was approximately 65 percent, which is lower than the historically reported mortality of up to 96 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysgammaglobulinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysgammaglobulinemia occurs in approximately one-third of XLP-affected males and has the best prognosis, especially when treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy.</p><p>In one cohort of 91 patients with XLP<em>,</em> dysgammaglobulinemia was the presenting manifestation in 22 percent, while more than 50 percent demonstrated dysgammaglobulinemia at any given time (enriched in the subpopulation of EBV-negative patients), with a mortality of approximately 5 percent (compared with the previously published mortality of approximately 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This percentage of dysgammaglobulinemia in EBV-negative XLP patients is significantly higher than the one-third of patients originally reported and could be related to increased awareness of dysgammaglobulinemia in the context of XLP, as well as the recognition that disease manifestations in XLP do not depend on EBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/28,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,43</a>].</p><p>Patients with dysgammaglobulinemia typically have decreased levels of IgG1 and IgG3, whereas levels of IgA and IgM are elevated, possibly secondary to decreased ability to class-switch from IgM to IgG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/15,22,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22,47</a>]. Dysgammaglobulinemia can progress over time to include deficiencies of all subclasses of immunoglobulins. Patients often have minimal antibody response to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids after multiple immunization attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. B and T cell numbers are normal, although abnormalities of B, T, and NK cell function can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/6,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,44</a>]. Furthermore, dysgammaglobulinemia can also be reflected in abnormal EBV serology following EBV infection, including persistent IgM positivity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of IgG positivity to EBV-associated antigens (eg, viral capsid antigen [VCA] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> EBV nuclear antigen [EBNA]).</p><p>Some patients with dysgammaglobulinemia secondary to XLP are erroneously diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. One study reported a 17-year-old male with a history of multiple infections and hypogammaglobulinemia leading to a diagnosis of CVID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. He later developed pancytopenia and died from fulminant infection (without evidence of prior EBV infection). Genetic analysis identified a mutation in <em>SH2D1A</em>. Another study reported two unrelated boys with recurrent respiratory tract infections and dysgammaglobulinemia that led to the diagnosis of CVID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Further reviews of patient and family histories, including multiple male family members who died at young ages in the family of the second boy in this report, raised suspicions for XLP. Genetic testing in both boys showed <em>SH2D1A</em> mutations.

These are primarily non-Hodgkin type, B cell lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. The excessive proliferation of B cells may be due to impaired immune surveillance and elimination by T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Lymphomas are often extranodal, with 75 percent occurring in the ileocecal region. They can also occur in the central nervous system, liver, and kidneys. Histologic classes of lymphomas include Burkitt lymphoma (53 percent of all B cell lymphomas), immunoblastic lymphoma, small cleaved or mixed cell lymphoma, and unclassifiable lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/6,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,50,51</a>].</p><p>Lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease was the presenting manifestation in approximately 14 percent and occurred at any time in approximately 24 percent of cases in an XLP cohort of 91 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

This clinical variability, despite the generally accepted lack of genotype-phenotype relationships, suggests that others factors may modify disease manifestations, severity, and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>One possible explanation for these findings is somatic reversion, which occurs in other immunodeficiency disorders as well. Somatic reversion is a spontaneous genetic change in a disease-causing mutation at the level of a single lymphoid precursor cell that reverts the gene back to normal. Reverted cells that showed signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP) expression and function, indicating a reversion process, were identified in 12 XLP patients from 10 different kindreds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Somatic reversion was found exclusively within CD8+ T cells with an effector memory phenotype. The acquired somatic reversion resulted in wild-type nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The reverted CD8+ T cell populations were maintained in vivo over a period of many years, as measured by persistent SAP expression. These revertant, or spontaneously &quot;gene-corrected,&quot; CD8+ T cells showed in vitro cytotoxicity against EBV-infected target cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with XLP demonstrate vigorous cytotoxic cellular responses, predominantly involving polyclonally activated alloreactive cytotoxic CD8 T cells, during acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Those who survive acute EBV infection usually have extensive immune defects. B and T cell numbers are normal to increased, but function is abnormal. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is low, and immunoglobulin M (IgM) is often increased. Natural killer (NK) cell activity is reduced. Anemia and thrombocytopenia may also be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for XLP should be considered in all males diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or other hypogammaglobulinemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with early mortality (especially if Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] associated), severe infectious mononucleosis, or lymphoma (especially B cell, non-Hodgkin lymphoma affecting extranodal sites). Males with a family history of known or suspected XLP should also be tested. Carrier testing is possible in female relatives of a male with a known or suspected XLP genetic mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Patients are generally first screened for mutations in the Src homology 2 domain protein 1A (<em>SH2D1A</em>), which encodes the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP). Although demonstration of a gene mutation is the gold standard for diagnosing XLP, gene sequencing may take weeks to complete, and delayed diagnosis of XLP could be detrimental to treatment. A more rapid assay that detects presence or absence of SAP protein expression via flow cytometry is also available as a screening tool to quickly diagnose cases of XLP in which protein is not expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. One study showed that flow-cytometric measurement of SAP accurately identified patients with <em>SH2D1A</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Flow-cytometric SAP determination can be combined with a functional measurement of 2B4-mediated NK cell killing of EBV-infected cells when SAP expression is reduced but not absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. As mentioned above, 2B4 promotes killing of EBV-infected cells in normal NK cells, whereas 2B4 interaction results in inhibition of NK cell function in SAP-deficient NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

HLH was the most common clinical manifestation of XIAP deficiency and was usually triggered by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. In addition, dysgammaglobulinemia (hypogammaglobulinemia) was also observed in patients with XIAP deficiency. However, the disease course in patients with XIAP deficiency appeared less severe than in XLP, with less frequent neurologic involvement and better prognosis. In addition, there was an association between XIAP deficiency and chronic colitis that was not seen with XLP, and lymphoma was not a feature of XIAP deficiency.
