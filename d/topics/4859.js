This includes situations in which the victim is unable to consent because of intoxication, inability to understand the consequences, misperceptions because of age, or other incapacities.</p><p><strong>Rape</strong> &ndash; The legal definition of rape varies from state to state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-risk-factors-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Date rape can occur when the victim is alert and rational or irrational, semiconscious, or unable to respond due to alcohol or other drug use. It can occur between two individuals who have had prior consensual sexual intercourse or other forms of intimacy. Verbal coercion, threats or use of physical force, or the use of alcohol or illicit drugs may occur as precipitating events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In many cases, date rape occurs within the context of a heterosexual dating relationship, with the male as perpetrator and the female as the victim. Same gender and female to male sexual violence also occur in dating relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-risk-factors-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Young women may endorse some of the same cultural stereotypes and attitudes reported by date rapists.

A male may perceive that if his female dating partner plays with her hair, looks into his eyes, or engages in discussions about sex, she wants to have intercourse.

It is important to avoid lectures. Instead, present facts and listen to the concerns and reactions of the patient.</p><p>To promote disclosure and encourage open and honest conversation about the topic of dating violence, providers can use an &quot;icebreaker&quot; before screening for dating violence. As an example, one could start by saying, &quot;Unfortunately, many of my patients have been hurt physically or sexually, either as children or during more recent relationships. Because I want to help my patients, I ask every patient who I see about these issues. I also know that it may be hard for some patients to talk about being hurt in their lives&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-risk-factors-and-prevention/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>The health care provider must take all concerns seriously and answer questions honestly. In addition, the provider must confront distortions and myths. As an example, providers can say, &quot;While it is okay for a dating partner to be jealous, jealousy is not the same as love. A partner who tries to tell you what to do or who to hang out with, puts you down, or makes you feel guilty or bad about yourself is not acting out of love.&quot; Young patients need to be encouraged to trust their instincts about a given dating situation or partner: &quot;If your partner or relationship feels uncomfortable to you, talk about it with an adult you trust.&quot;</p><p>Empathy induction is a tool that can be used to facilitate attitudinal and behavioral changes in males and females with regard to sexual assault prevention and may be particularly helpful for adolescents who believe they are invulnerable to sexual assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-risk-factors-and-prevention/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Empathy induction involves asking the patient what it would be like for them, their sister, or their close friend to experience date rape. This allows the patient to better understand and listen to the information that the provider is sharing and allows the provider to make attributions to the patient's personal behaviors without being confrontational.</p><p>Finally, it is useful to encourage the parent to be an active participant in discussions about dating violence and to provide information <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resources to the parents for these discussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-risk-factors-and-prevention/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]. Parents can continue and extend the conversations after the visit; they can also monitor for signs that their adolescent may be in a violent dating relationship.

One program for male undergraduate students also reported that program participants had less hostility toward women, had less positive views of nonconsensual sex, and less comfort with other men's inappropriate behaviors than nonparticipants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-risk-factors-and-prevention/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377866414\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resources related to <span class=\"nowrap\">date/acquaintance</span> rape for patients, parents, and providers are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/datingviolence/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsUm3kblGvPozSmcJ2qB5Nz9OZdtdXHozsdUWz/m/qc1HXq4d/ydk7+l/EFtHdk9Svw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14315\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Teen Dating Violence</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/teen-dating-violence-2014-a.pdf&amp;token=2GK5//GCXFaswXdh8rGAin2CbKNmNNIntEslyX1tuR4vabvxUsrFQnfFPtsIpl+/yyLRDzSBhGfFMMcYu41PC8FQye4LbwncoQKpvteNcVU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=14315\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Understanding Teen Dating Violence Fact Sheet</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://ncemch.org/guides/datingviolence.php&amp;token=HhVwHMKmC1wsP5pMAn59wjK+qjugkerWDJAcRJE4zMO4wZRXj4YBpK6J27zFytN2PlD1r7C6AwyRXM5evdVDyg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14315\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Center for Education in Maternal and Child Health (Georgetown University)</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims/get-help-bulletins-for-crime-victims/bulletins-for-teens/dating-violence&amp;token=FWbWfZGdCZAcEpYvoud/QuPyvdshiXdO26168glUT0R6Kv4fUYh2yJtglxEBLyH9zFLz6tNMnjwwjkESZOfMS8QTqOYO6T8yAfp6TcdyN737RcpJipfWejk+gy+CZPR/&amp;TOPIC_ID=14315\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The National Center for the Victims of Crime</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.nsvrc.org/&amp;token=+CotSUwOOemG5tAK1JKE7d3cIlMEh69L70UM/9p6gBQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=14315\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_mind/relationships/date_rape.html&amp;token=flSdOC993tIZFF9pkasJqWIUbP2RArG62MXMF7xZHSYee94BxPGe3TvyY0Lb4FTnOp265QaA6LSI5mvKqnYSLw3PxUOXClcp5xitQY/i0ZM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=14315\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">TeensHealth from Nemours</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19095781\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Date rape refers to nonconsensual sexual penetration that occurs between two people who are in a romantic relationship. (See <a href=\"#H19095688\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Date rape occurs predominantly in adolescent and young adult women (age 16 through 24 years). Other risk factors for date rape are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75628 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19095695\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors that contribute to date rape include acceptance of rape myths (prejudiced, stereotyped, or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists), strong belief in traditional gender roles, perceptions that forced sexual activity is acceptable in certain circumstances (eg, the victim has led the perpetrator on), the belief that sexual rights and responsibilities are inherent in a dating relationship, and the misperception of nonverbal cues or signals for desired sexual intimacy. (See <a href=\"#H64192887\" class=\"local\">'Other contributing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents and young adults should be provided with anticipatory guidance to prevent date rape. This includes promoting healthy dating relationships by helping patients learn to communicate effectively about sexual beliefs, desires, and boundaries; dispelling rape myths; educating patients to avoid risk factors for date rape; and advising them about what to do if they are sexually assaulted despite their precautions. (See <a href=\"#H19095744\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"#H377866414\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437416112\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Vaughn Rickert, PsyD, who passed away in June 2015.
