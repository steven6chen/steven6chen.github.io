Each step of development can be influenced by a variety of processes, including genetic endowment; the biologic clock; cellular, neural, and hormonal regulatory mechanisms; and the environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>On a cellular level, these mechanisms most likely are regulated by the homeobox (Hox) genes, cell-to-cell interactions, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and transcription factors. As a general rule, maturation tends to occur along craniocaudal and proximodistal axes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65282 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Determination of the specific program of an intestinal region (ie, anterior, mid, or posterior) occurs first, followed by detailed differentiation within that region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The signal pathways for mid-gut development may be a default pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], with plasticity imposed on the anterior or posterior regions by Hox genes.

They, in turn, are controlled by Gaf-1, a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) gene family. Pitx2 (and its partner Isl1) has been identified in the dorsal mesentery, which anchors the gut to the embryo. It is in this area that extracellular matrix proteins first show asymmetry, tilting the gut to the left [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The Pitx2 control of the development of the cecum also involves fibroblast growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The intracellular events are not fully elucidated, but involve hedgehog proteins and retinoic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Primary ciliary dyskinesia also is associated with situs inversus but through different mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-ciliary-dyskinesia-immotile-cilia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary ciliary dyskinesia (immotile-cilia syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both absorptive and digestive functions of the intestine are present at term in the human neonate. Disaccharidases expressed in the brush border become active in mid-gestation, and are all active during infancy in healthy children. Because lactase activity in the fetus increases late in gestation, premature infants born at 28 to 32 weeks of gestation have reduced lactase activity. After about five years, lactase activity declines in many racial groups as part of a normal process of gene inactivation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Acquired primary lactase deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H415113837\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Developmental lactase deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Active electrogenic transport of glucose is present in the human fetal small intestine due to the high-affinity sodium-dependent system (SGLT1 co-transporter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The duodenum-to-ileum gradient of glucose absorption is established between the 17th and 30th weeks of gestation. The developmental expression of facilitated glucose transporter isoform GLUT2, which is responsible for exit of glucose across the basolateral membrane, follows that of SGLT1. Amino acid transporters follow a similar developmental trajectory and are fully active at birth.</p><p>Prenatal expression of genes that code for nutrient transporters and disaccharidases occurs in both colon and small intestine, but the expression disappears from the colon during the third trimester, when the villous structure of the colon turns into a flat mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULARIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The supportive elements that will provide the vascular supply, the neural and hormonal regulation, and the host defenses of the GI tract evolve concurrently with its anatomic development. The arterial bed develops as three ventral outbuddings from the aorta to form the celiac axis, and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80755\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80755 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>Mesenteric blood flow is regulated at two points (the arteriole and the precapillary sphincter) and controlled at two levels (intrinsic and extrinsic). Intrinsic control by local factors regulates blood flow in response to changes in arterial pressure and tissue oxygenation, such as those caused by vascular constriction or feeding. Extrinsic regulation is mediated by sympathetic input from the splanchnic nerves.</p><p>Several other factors are important. Circulating endogenous and exogenous factors (eg, hormones) may modulate vascular tone. The mesenteric blood flow also exhibits &quot;autoregulatory escape,&quot; which refers to the restoration of gut blood flow in the face of extrinsic regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. When gut blood flow is decreased artificially by stimulating periarterial mesenteric nerves (ie, the extrinsic system of control) or by infusing norepinephrine, blood flow is restored within minutes by the intrinsic system of control, which is triggered by local changes (eg, tissue hypoxia). The clinical advantages of this phenomenon have long been debated, but it is likely that they relate to the unique functions of the mesenteric vasculature. The mesenteric venous system not only removes the products of tissue metabolism (as do other vascular beds), but it also transports molecules and electrolytes that have been absorbed by the intestine. An escape from arteriolar constriction will enhance the distribution of absorbed nutrients at a time when blood flow would otherwise have been reduced by increased systemic sympathetic activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NEURAL AND MOTOR FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neural structures of the alimentary tract are formed when neural crest cells migrate into the rapidly growing gut. Precursors migrate from the embryonic central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The neural crest cells and muscle cells differentiate to form the three layers of muscle that surround the mucosa and the neural network that regulates its function.</p><p>Control of motor function is provided primarily by the enteric nervous system (a subsystem of the autonomic nervous system), which is composed of a variety of plexuses of nerve cell bodies and interneuronal circuits. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates the presence of neurotransmitters by 24 weeks gestation, but the adult distribution may not be achieved until near term. Abnormalities in the migration and differentiation of neural crest cells result in an array of GI problems, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hirschsprung disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (pigmentary abnormalities in association with aganglionic megacolon; this condition is also called Waardenburg syndrome type IV and Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-genodermatoses#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The genodermatoses&quot;, section on 'Waardenburg syndrome'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Haddad syndrome (with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome [CCHS]; this condition is also called Ondine-Hirschsprung syndrome) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and other causes of sleep-related hypoventilation in children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal neuronal dysplasias (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704000513\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other causes'</a>)</p><p/><p>Motor activity is immature in the preterm infant.

Regulation of lower esophageal sphincter tone and small intestinal motor contractions are also immature, and continue to develop into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Gastric contents are emptied more slowly in preterm infants than in term infants, and small intestinal transit is slower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONAL REGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone interact with cellular signals in the maturation of the intestinal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Numerous regulatory gut peptides are also produced in the developing GI tract. Some of these peptides function as true hormones (eg, gastrin, cholecystokinin, motilin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin), whereas others have paracrine or neurocrine function (eg, gastric inhibitory peptide, bombesin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neurotensin, enteroglucagon, and peptide YY). All of these peptides are present by the end of the first trimester in the fetus, but adult distribution may not be established until term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Many of these hormones are released in response to feeding. The release of some of these is limited in the newborn compared with the adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In older (prepubertal) children, GI hormones have been implicated in the development of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. For example, glucagon-like peptide-1 has an inverse relationship to body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HOST DEFENSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many aspects of host defense are mechanical in nature and appear early in gestation. Mucus production, for example, is present in the very preterm infant. Transcription factors involved in early ontogeny, such as FOXQ, regulate genes that control mucin expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. On the other hand, gastric emptying and peristalsis, which prevent stasis of intestinal contents, appear later and may not be fully functional in the preterm infant.</p><p>T cells and B cells are produced as early as 14 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, antigenic stimulation of the lamina propria cells does not occur until after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) is present in very low concentrations in fetal life, as the newborn intestine has few IgA-producing plasma cells. Therefore, preterm infants are unable to form antibodies to exogenous protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the production and release of cytokines are brisk. &#160;</p><p>Until the advent of technologies able to identify microbiota with rapid DNA sequencing (which allows detection of non-culturable bacteria), the gut was believed to be sterile in utero. Bacteria have been identified in both placenta and amniotic fluid in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. While the major phase of bacterial colonization begins at birth, the pattern of bacteria (at least in the meconium of infants born by caesarian section) is influenced by maternal intra-uterine bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A variety of other factors influence colonization, including mode of delivery, type of feeding, and use of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In healthy infants, aerobic organisms become abundant within a few hours, and anaerobic organisms by 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These organisms are capable of metabolizing bile acids, nonabsorbed proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Thus, they potentially may play an important role in the processing of nutrients in preterm infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants&quot;, section on 'Advantages of human milk'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the microbiota directs the maturation of the host immune system, including direct interaction with dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and the regulation of T cell maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].
