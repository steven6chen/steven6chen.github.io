Primary prevention, screening, and techniques of skin examination are discussed separately.

In 2011, the overall age-adjusted incidence of melanoma was 19.7 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. From 1982 to 2011, melanoma incidence rates doubled in the United States, while mortality rates remained&nbsp;constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence rates increased with age and were highest among non-Hispanic whites (24.6 per 100,000). Among white individuals, the incidence rates of invasive melanoma were 27.<span class=\"nowrap\">4/100,000</span> men and 16.<span class=\"nowrap\">7/100,000</span> women per year in the years 2006 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Lentigo maligna melanoma has been increasing at a higher rate compared with other subtypes of melanoma combined for patients aged 45 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the incidence of melanoma in the United States may be underestimated because many cases diagnosed and treated in private practices are not reported to cancer registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of melanoma is also rising worldwide. The estimated age-standardized incidence rates of melanoma in men and women worldwide increased from 2.3 and 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/100,000</span> people, respectively, in 1990 to 3.1 and 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/100,000</span> people in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Between the early 1970s and 2000, the estimated incidence of melanoma in Central Europe increased from 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/100,000</span> inhabitants per year to 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/100,000</span> inhabitants per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An analysis of data from 18 European cancer registries showed that between 1995 and 2012 the incidence of both invasive and in situ melanoma increased annually by 4 and 7.7 percent, respectively, in men and by 3 and 6.3 percent, respectively, in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The overall increase in the incidence of invasive melanoma was predominantly due to an increase in the incidence of thin tumors.</p><p>Data from the Queensland Cancer Registry for the period 1995 to 2014 confirmed that the incidence of melanoma in Queensland, Australia, is the highest in the world (72 per 100,000 per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While the incidence of in situ melanoma increased over the 20-year period across all age groups, the incidence of invasive melanoma decreased among individuals under the age of 40 years, was stable in the age group 40 to 60 years, and increased among individuals older than 60 years.</p><p>Some investigators have suggested that the reported increase in melanoma incidence results at least in part from of an increasing number of skin biopsies and significant variability in the histologic interpretation of early evolving lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, this explanation does not account for the increase in melanoma mortality rates, particularly in older men.</p><p>Others have speculated that the increasing incidence of melanoma is related to a rise in screening for melanoma, leading to the detection of thinner, more indolent lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, a study of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data (1992-2004) from non-Hispanic whites found increasing incidence of melanoma of all thicknesses and among all socioeconomic levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Individuals of low socioeconomic status, who were believed to be less likely to have access to screening services, exhibited the highest increase in melanoma incidence when compared with subjects with higher socioeconomic status. In a study of a population-based screening program, the incidence of in situ and invasive melanomas in the screened population increased throughout the one-year screening period, but returned to baseline levels in the three years after the screening program was discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the control region, by contrast, a small increase in incidence was observed throughout the study period. These results suggest that screening accounts for some, but not all, of the increase in melanoma incidence.</p><p>Melanoma is rare in children and adolescents, and approximately 90 percent of these cases are in those &ge;10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].

An analysis of data from the Queensland Cancer Registry for the period 1995 to 2014 showed decreased or stable mortality rates in all age groups except in men aged 60 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the United States, the overall mortality from melanoma has remained stable from 1982 to 2011, with over 9000 individuals dying from it every year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. From 2002 through 2006, the mortality rates decreased in men and women younger than 65 years, but increased for older individuals (+6.6 percent for men and +0.6 percent for women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The decline in mortality noted in younger patients may represent the effects of public education on early detection and treatment.</p><p>There are no clinical trials demonstrating that screening decreases the mortality from melanoma. However, five years after the completion of a screening program involving about 400,000 participants in Germany, the mortality rates from melanoma in the screened area were 50 percent lower than those observed in the nonscreened regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The majority of melanomas develop on sun-exposed skin, particularly in areas that are more susceptible to sunburn. Individuals with naturally dark skin or whose skin darkens easily upon sun exposure have lower rates of melanoma, supporting the concept that greater penetration of UV light into the skin results in a higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Intermittent exposure and sunburn in adolescence or childhood were strongly associated with an increased risk of melanoma, while occupational exposure did not confer an increased risk. These findings support the hypothesis that melanoma risk is affected primarily by intermittent intense sun exposure.

This is supported by the higher incidence of melanoma in equatorial regions than in latitudes farther from the equator, as UVB radiation is most intense at the equator while UVA intensity varies less across latitudes.</p><p>Although UVB appears to be more important than UVA as a risk factor, a causal link to UVA exposure is also supported by data from patients using tanning beds <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treated with psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) for psoriasis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Indoor tanning'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'PUVA therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3494124484\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenetic mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two independent pathogenetic pathways for UV-induced melanomagenesis have been postulated: a melanin-independent pathway associated with direct UVB-induced DNA damage and a UVA-initiated, pigment-dependent pathway associated with indirect oxidative DNA damage in melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. UVB-induced mutations are typically cytosine-to-thymine transitions arising from cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) that are rapidly formed in the DNA as an effect of UVB irradiation. In contrast, UVA radiation generates CPDs in melanocytes for over three hours after exposure (&quot;dark CPDs&quot;) by a mechanism that involves melanin, in particular pheomelanin, and reactive oxygen species as cofactors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Furthermore, in experimental studies, both UVA and UVB radiation have been shown to accelerate <em>BRAF</em>-mediated melanomagenesis through <em>TP53</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and pattern of sun exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern and timing of sun exposure appear to be important for skin cancer. Nonmelanoma cancers are associated with cumulative sun exposure and occur most frequently in areas maximally exposed to the sun (eg, face, dorsal hands, forearms).</p><p>In contrast, melanomas tend to be associated with intense, intermittent sun exposure and sunburns and they frequently occur in areas exposed to the sun only sporadically (eg, the back in men, the legs in women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. This association with intermittent sun exposure may not be true for all body sites; for example, melanomas of the head and neck are more frequent in patients with high occupational sun exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Exposure early in life seems particularly important. Individuals who have had five or more severe sunburns in childhood or adolescence have an estimated twofold greater risk of developing melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/36,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40</a>]. Moreover, the incidence of melanoma is higher among people who migrate from northern to more equatorial latitudes; this effect is seen predominantly among those who were children at the time of migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>It is not clear why intermittent extreme sun exposure appears to increase the risk of melanoma, whereas chronic suberythemogenic exposure is associated more with nonmelanoma skin cancer. After severe UV radiation-induced DNA damage, keratinocytes (from which squamous and basal cell carcinomas arise) undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. In contrast, melanocytes are resistant to this level of radiation, and their survival results in the propagation of mutated genes, especially if damaged DNA is not fully repaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/27,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,43</a>].</p><p>This may be an evolutionarily selected advantage for the organism, as the melanocytes survive a sunburn and can protect regenerating keratinocytes. However, on a cellular level, melanocytes that have suffered mutation of growth-regulating genes may have an unwanted growth advantage, resulting in disordered control of cell cycling and replication. Despite the high mortality associated with melanoma, the mechanisms that diminish melanocyte apoptosis may paradoxically be evolutionarily selected, as melanomas most often arise after the age of childbearing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Indoor tanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1920s, &quot;sun therapy&quot; gained popularity as a cure for multiple maladies. The French fashion designer Gabrielle &quot;Coco&quot; Chanel further glamorized the deep tan as a status symbol. Fifty years later, commercial tanning beds, which emit UVA light, became widespread. </p><p>Results from the United States 2010 National Health Interview Survey and 2011 <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6104.pdf&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsajzExPs42ugYu31o9z/k3lau7hYcsCr+12toEgKNOan&amp;TOPIC_ID=4844\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Youth Risk Behavior Survey</a> (YRBS) reveal that nearly a third of white women aged 18 to 25 years reported indoor tanning in the past year, with approximately 15 percent engaging in frequent indoor tanning (&ge;10 sessions in the previous year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].&nbsp;A subsequent analysis of data from the 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 YRBS, however, showed a substantial decrease in the rate of high school students engaging in indoor tanning, from 15.6 percent (95% CI 13.7-17.6) in 2009 to 7.3 percent (95% CI 6.0-8.9) in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The decrease was significant among both female (from 25.4 to 10.6 percent) and male students (from 6.7 to 4 percent). Indoor tanning was also positively associated with sunburn, with 82 percent of indoor tanners reporting in 2015 at least one sunburn during the preceding year versus 54 percent of those who did not engage in indoor tanning. </p><p>The reasons for the decline in the use of indoor tanning among high school students in the United States is incompletely understood. It is possible that multiple factors, including the acknowledgment of the role of UV-emitting tanning devices as a carcinogen to human skin by the World Health Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], increased taxation on indoor tanning implemented in 2010, and restriction of minors from accessing indoor tanning in most states, may have increased the awareness of the health risks associated with indoor tanning in the general population. </p><p>A systematic review of 88 observational studies with nearly 500,000 participants from 16 Western countries found a summary prevalence of ever exposure to indoor tanning of 36 percent among adults, 55 percent among university students, and 19 percent among adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Regulations restricting the access to indoor tanning facilities to young individuals have been implemented worldwide; they are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

No effect was found for decaffeinated coffee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A subsequent analysis of data from a large cohort from 10 European countries including nearly 500,000 individuals aged 25 to 70 years participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study confirmed an inverse association between caffeinated coffee and melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. In this analysis, the consumption of caffeinated coffee or tea was associated with a decrease in melanoma risk among men but not among women (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.69 and HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.62-1.47, respectively), after adjusting for education, smoking habit, alcohol intake, diet, body mass index, reproductive history, and use of exogenous hormones. No association was found for decaffeinated coffee or tea. However, the significance of these results remains uncertain because data on known risk factors for melanoma, including light phenotype, number of nevi, family history of melanoma, and ultraviolet radiation exposure, were not available for the participants in this study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An analysis of data from over 100,000 individuals participating in the Nurse's Health Study found a modest increase in melanoma risk associated with high dietary intake of citrus fruit or juice (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14-1.63), after adjusting for recognized risk factors for melanoma, such as family history of melanoma-phenotypic characteristics, number of nevi, and lifetime number of blistering sunburns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. A potential explanation for the association between melanoma and citrus fruit consumption is that citrus fruits are a source of psoralens, chemical compounds present in plants known to be photosensitizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. However, the results of this study need further confirmation, because, given the small increase in risk, residual confounding cannot be excluded. In the meantime, changes in dietary advice to the public are not warranted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smoking</strong> &ndash; Although skin changes may be related to smoking, smoking has not been found to be an independent risk factor for melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone therapy</strong> &ndash; Multiple studies have assessed the risk of melanoma associated with oral contraceptives (OCPs), with some finding an elevated risk, particularly with prolonged use. However, two meta-analyses of observational studies showed no evidence for an increased risk of melanoma with the use of OCPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>].

The risk of melanoma was also evaluated in approximately 17,000 siblings of PD patients and 84,000 siblings of PD-free individuals. PD patients had a 60 percent higher risk of melanoma than PD-free individuals (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.35-1.92). In contrast, the risk of melanoma was similar in siblings of PD patients and in those of PD-free individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A retrospective United States study using data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records from 1976 to 2013 identified a cohort of 974 PD patients, of whom 26 had a diagnosis of melanoma preceding the diagnosis of PD, whereas 6 had a melanoma following the diagnosis of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. Compared with controls, PD patients had a 3.8-fold increased likelihood of having a history of melanoma. Patients with melanoma identified from the same database had a 4.2-fold increased risk of developing PD after the diagnosis of melanoma, compared with controls. While these findings suggest that melanoma and PD may share environmental or genetic risk factors, the underlying cause of this association remains to be clarified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although early case reports mentioned levodopa (a common therapy for PD) as a potential etiologic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>], an increased risk for melanoma precedes the diagnosis and treatment of the neurologic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. In addition, a systematic review and a subsequent case-control study found no association between melanoma and this drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/140,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,141</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History of prostate cancer</strong> &ndash; The United States Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study, including over 40,000 participants, found that a personal history of prostate cancer was associated with an increased risk of melanoma (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.32-2.54, adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>, skin phototype, nevus count, family history of melanoma, and history of sun exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].

A 2011 systematic review and meta-analysis of two studies from cancer registries found an increased risk of melanoma associated with TNF (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.92-2.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>BRAF inhibitors</strong> &ndash; Case reports have been published describing secondary cutaneous melanoma in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors. It is unclear if this association is based on a direct BRAF inhibition effect or due to the identification of synchronous melanomas that might have already been present at the time treatment was initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sildenafil</a> &ndash; A study of nearly 26,000 men participating in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed up from 2000 to 2010, found an association between sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase-5 [PDE5] inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction) and invasive melanoma after controlling for potential melanoma risk factors, such as age, number of moles, and severe sunburns (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.04-3.22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution because of the lack of control for other confounders (eg, health status, lifestyle practices) and lack of information about the dose, frequency, and duration of sildenafil use or the use of other PDE5 inhibitors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A modest 14 to 30 percent increase in risk of melanoma for men who had at least one prescription of a PDE5 inhibitor was also found in a nested case-control study in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and the Swedish&nbsp;Melanoma&nbsp;Register including over 4000 men with a diagnosis of melanoma and 20,000 cancer-free male controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. However, the absence of a dose-response effect for PDE5 inhibitors and the lack of information on important personal and lifestyle-related melanoma risk factors raise the question on whether this association is causal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Finally, a large population-based matched cohort study using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink and including over 145,000 men with &ge;1 PDE5 inhibitor prescription and 560,000 unexposed matched controls found only a weak association between PDE5 inhibitor use and incidence of melanoma (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.29) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. However, the study found a similar weak association of PDE5 inhibitors with basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis but not colorectal cancer. These findings, in addition to the absence of a dose-response effect between PDE5 inhibitors and melanoma and the lack of information on personal sun exposure habits, suggest that the association between PDE5 inhibitors and melanoma is likely explained by the confounding effect of sun exposure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> &ndash; Melanoma in situ has been reported in two patients during long-term therapy with voriconazole, an antifungal drug that has been associated with cutaneous photosensitivity and squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>].

In the United States, melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh most common cancer in women. (See <a href=\"#H5112797\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence suggests that ultraviolet light is a major risk factor for melanoma. Although ultraviolet B radiation plays a greater role in the development of melanoma, exposure to ultraviolet A radiation (including tanning beds and psoralen-ultraviolet A radiation [PUVA] therapy) also appears to be a risk factor. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ultraviolet radiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanoma tends to be associated with a history of intense, intermittent sun exposure, and most frequently occurs on areas that are exposed to the sun sporadically, such as the back in men and legs in women. However, chronic sun exposure may contribute to the development of melanoma on other sites, such as the head and neck. A history of multiple severe sunburns in childhood also is associated with increased melanoma risk. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Timing and pattern of sun exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of several studies have implicated tanning beds as a risk factor for melanoma. In 2009, the World Health Organization classified ultraviolet light emitted from tanning beds as a human carcinogen. Ultraviolet A therapy with high doses of psoralens (PUVA) has also been identified as a risk factor for melanoma. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Indoor tanning'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'PUVA therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient-specific factors influence the risk for melanoma. High numbers of typical nevi, the presence of atypical nevi, a personal history of melanoma, and genetic factors can increase risk. Patients with the familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome have a risk of melanoma much greater than that of the general population. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Typical nevi'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3231403696\" class=\"local\">'Atypical nevi'</a> above and <a href=\"#H55103422\" class=\"local\">'Personal history of melanoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H55103208\" class=\"local\">'Genetic background'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at high risk for melanoma should be counseled about sun protection and skin self-examination and should be followed with periodic dermatologic evaluation, including dermoscopy and digital imaging where available, according to melanoma risk stratification protocols.
