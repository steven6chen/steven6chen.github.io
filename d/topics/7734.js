If psychotic features (eg, delusions or hallucinations) are also present, resolution of these features is required for remission. For patients who do not achieve remission, a reasonable goal is response, which is defined as stabilization of the patient&rsquo;s safety and substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of psychotic and mood symptoms; response is often operationalized as a reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent, using standardized assessment scales. (See <a href=\"#H3844407258\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580146996\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for geriatric bipolar patients begins with a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory and imaging studies. The evaluation establishes the bipolar symptoms and comorbid disorders that require treatment, as well as any contraindications to treatment (eg, renal impairment and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, or hepatic disease and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>). The assessment for late-life bipolar disorder is discussed separately.

Hospitalization may be required for safety and stabilization, particularly for severely ill patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suicidal ideation with a specific plan and intent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delusions or hallucinations that place the patient at imminent risk of coming to harm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance use that is exacerbating the mood episode</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired functioning (eg, inability to feed or clothe oneself) </p><p/><p>Moderately ill patients with late-life bipolar disorder can generally be treated in a partial hospital (day) program or residential facility (eg, nursing home), including patients with suicidality that does not pose an imminent risk (eg, fleeting thoughts of killing oneself with vague or nonexistent plans and no intent). An outpatient clinic may be suitable for less acutely ill patients (eg, thoughts that family members would be better off if the patient was dead, with no plan or intent to commit suicide). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3476857680\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should &ldquo;start low and go slow&rdquo; when prescribing medications for geriatric bipolar patients, especially frail, medically compromised patients who have difficulty tolerating medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Comorbid diseases, concomitant medications, and age-related physiologic changes can alter a drug&rsquo;s pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, which often affect therapeutic and adverse responses. Thus, we suggest that clinicians:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start the drug at a low dose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase the dose by small increments every one to seven days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise caution regarding side effects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordinate care with other clinicians who are managing general medical comorbidity </p><p/><p>Older bipolar patients taking multiple medications due to comorbid illnesses are at risk for drug-drug interactions. Specific interactions of any particular drug with other medications may be determined by using the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions.</p><p>A review of 34 treatment guidelines from 19 countries found that recommendations for choosing medications for geriatric bipolar disorder are generally similar to recommendations for younger adults, with the caveat that general medical comorbidity and concomitant medications can render older adults more vulnerable to adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The relative lack of recommendations that are specific to older adults with bipolar disorder is due in part to the lack of randomized trials in this population. Choosing medications for patients with geriatric bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric bipolar disorder: Acute treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-bipolar-disorder-maintenance-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric bipolar disorder: Maintenance treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of medications includes subgroup analyses of results for geriatric patients enrolled in randomized trials conducted with mixed-age adult bipolar patients (18 to 65 years). These studies generally show that response is comparable for older and younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Other evidence consists of prospective observational prospective studies, retrospective studies, and case reports. </p><p>Treatment of geriatric mania and bipolar major depression may require a combination of two psychotropic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, mood episodes with psychotic symptoms generally require treatment with a second-generation antipsychotic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, either as monotherapy or combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3844407258\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with younger patients, geriatric bipolar patients suffer more general medical comorbidity and medication side effects, and thus often require more vigilant treatment monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Hospitalized geriatric patients are monitored daily. Outpatients are commonly seen on a weekly basis until they have responded (eg, the number, intensity, and frequency of mood symptoms has improved by at least 50 percent) and have tolerated the medication regimen for two to four weeks. At that point the patient can be seen every two to four weeks until they remit. Following remission, patients receive maintenance treatment and the schedule for monitoring is decreased.

The group program met weekly during year 1 and monthly during year 2, and focused upon social rehabilitation and social skills training; usual care included pharmacotherapy and case management.

Bipolar disorder in both geriatric and younger patients is characterized by episodes of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91398\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398 \">table 1</a>), mania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106 \">table 2</a>), and hypomania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1124194109\" class=\"local\">'Definition of geriatric bipolar disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for geriatric bipolar patients begins with a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory and imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H3580146996\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacotherapy for older age bipolar disorder generally requires starting the drug at a low dose, increasing the dose by small increments every one to seven days, caution regarding side effects, and coordinating care with other clinicians who are managing general medical comorbidity. Treatment guideline recommendations for choosing medications for geriatric bipolar disorder are generally similar to recommendations for younger adults, with the caveat that general medical comorbidity and concomitant medications can render older adults more vulnerable to adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H3476857680\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with younger patients, geriatric bipolar patients often require more vigilant treatment monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H3844407258\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with geriatric bipolar disorder may possibly benefit from adding group psychoeducation to pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H1258328159\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive psychoeducation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of acute, geriatric bipolar mood episodes that do not respond to initial treatment generally includes verifying that the patient has bipolar disorder rather than a different condition, asking about adherence with treatment, determining whether there are significant life stressors that need to be addressed, and establishing if comorbid psychopathology is present. (See <a href=\"#H3437150415\" class=\"local\">'Managing nonresponse'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary care clinicians often treat geriatric patients with bipolar disorder. However, the diagnosis may not be clear or these clinicians may not be comfortable managing the disorder and thus refer patients to psychiatrists. In addition, referral is usually indicated for patients with severe mood episodes, numerous recurrent episodes, suicidal ideation or behavior, aggressive behavior, psychotic features, catatonia, mixed features, poor judgment, psychiatric comorbidity, nonresponse to treatment, or bipolar major depression. (See <a href=\"#H566999148\" class=\"local\">'Making referrals'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several specific treatments are available for geriatric bipolar disorder.
