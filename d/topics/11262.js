These receptors are members of a family of nuclear hormone receptors that include receptors that bind other steroids, thyroid hormone, and retinoids, and receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and liver X receptor (LXR) that mediate metabolic processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], as well as many &quot;orphan&quot; receptors for which no ligands have been identified. All these receptors function as ligand-modulated nuclear transcription factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>Two ER molecules have been identified: the original ER-alpha, and the ER-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Their structures are similar to those of the other members of this family of receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The key components are the C or DNA-binding domain, which binds with high affinity and specificity to DNA sequences (estrogen response elements [EREs]) to regulate transcription rates of target genes, and the E or ligand-binding domain, which binds estrogens and estrogen analogues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of action of selective estrogen receptor modulators and down-regulators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The consensus ERE is a 13-base-pair inverted-repeat DNA sequence (GGTCAnnnTGACC), to which dimers of ER complexes bind with high affinity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], with one receptor molecule in contact with each five-base-pair segment of the response element [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dimerization of ER complexes is facilitated by receptor binding to a response element. Additional sequences located in the ligand-binding domain of the receptor also are involved in dimerization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>], as demonstrated by the formation of homodimers by truncated receptors containing only a ligand-binding domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The ERs contain two regions, termed activation functions (AF): AF-1, located toward the amino-terminal end of the receptor, acts independent of ligand, whereas AF-2, located in the ligand-binding domain, is ligand dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Steroid receptor co-regulators (SRCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>] interact with ERs and function together with massive multimeric complexes that facilitate access to chromatin, and dynamically coordinate the steps of transcription, including initiation, elongation, termination, and clearing or turnover of the transcriptional modulators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94624 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Regulation of access to chromatin is facilitated or impeded in part by modifications of histones, the proteins that &quot;package&quot; DNA. Acetylation of histone tails is mediated by histone acetyl transferases (HATs), which increase access, and deacetylation by histone de-acetylases (HDACs), which increase chromatin compaction. SRC itself has HAT activity, and ER-SRC interacts with other HATs and with HDACs. Targeting of HDAC with inhibitors is an emerging therapy in breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>When an estrogen or estrogen analogue reaches the cell nucleus and binds to an ER, the conformation of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor is altered, allowing interaction with coactivator molecules if the ligand is an agonist, but preventing this interaction if the ligand is an antagonist, ultimately altering transcriptional rates of estrogen-responsive genes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94624 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/5,17,19,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,19,27</a>].</p><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with next generation sequencing, called ChIP-seq, allows comprehensive analysis of all the sites of interaction between ER-alpha and DNA in a cell or tissue. These types of studies have indicated that most ER-alpha binding does not occur at gene promoters, but often in regions more than 100,000 base pairs from transcribed genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. It was through this approach that FoxA1's role as a pioneer factor, facilitating ER-alpha binding in breast cancer cells, was discovered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Although estrogen greatly increases ER-alpha recruitment to chromatin and is needed to regulate transcription of target genes, ER-alpha ChIP-seq analysis of mouse uterine tissue demonstrated that some ER-alpha is pre-bound to DNA in the absence of estrogen, with the number of sites per gene increased with hormone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative mechanisms of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the classic mechanism of ER function, ERs can sometimes regulate expression of genes that lack an estrogen-response element. As an example, in cultured cells, ERs can modulate the transcriptional activity of heterodimers of the transcription factors fos and jun, resulting in activation of reporter genes containing activator protein 1 (AP-1) elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, complexes of ERs and specificity protein 1 (SP1) molecules can activate some reporter genes, such as those for <em>c-FOS</em> and transforming growth factor alpha, which lack a full estrogen-response element, by binding respectively to half sites of these response elements and guanine cytosine (GC)-rich sequences in the regulatory regions of these genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/13,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,35-37</a>]. How much importance such gene regulatory mechanisms contribute to physiological responsiveness will require further studies with additional models. A mouse with ER-alpha mutations that prevent its interaction with DNA lack estrogen responses, including uterine and mammary gland development and growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In addition, these mice lack estrogen-induced gene regulation, indicating that ER-alpha DNA-binding independent mechanisms of response are not sufficient to support normal physiologic functions.</p><p>ERs can also function independently of estrogen. Specifically, both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), acting via their extracellular membrane bound receptors, can couple cell signaling mechanisms to stimulate transcription of ER target genes in the absence of estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/13,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,40-42</a>]. Thus, cross-talk and signal amplification can be coupled between membrane-bound growth factor receptor pathways and nuclear receptors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-GENOMIC ACTIONS OF ESTROGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estrogens bind with high affinity to other cell components, including plasma membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Some effects of estrogen, such as rapid induction of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, appear to involve direct action of estrogen receptors (ERs) at the plasma membrane rather than genomic modulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/45-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-52</a>].</p><p>As these rapid effects occur without ER-gene interaction, they are called &quot;non-genomic,&quot; although the signals initiated by these mechanisms ultimately result in regulation of genes. These responses are observed in diverse tissues, including the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, and in breast cancer cells. Several models have been developed that describe mechanisms for these non-genomic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>In some cases, the same ER molecule (ER-alpha or ER-beta) that interacts with genes in the nucleus becomes associated with the plasma membrane by interacting with membrane proteins such as caveolin, growth factor receptor-binding proteins such as Shc, or with guanosine (G) nucleotide-binding proteins. Alternatively, a G protein-coupled receptor, <em>GPR30</em>, may be activated at the membrane by estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>]. The physiological significance of these rapid effects and how they are integrated with the nuclear responses to estrogen are important questions that are currently being investigated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC ROLES OF ESTROGENS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550658657\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical examples of estrogen insensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to produce gene-targeted mice and rats in which the estrogen receptor (ER) genes or the gene for aromatase, the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens, have been knocked out or altered to selectively disrupt signaling in specific cells or disable one aspect of estrogen signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/38,59-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,59-80</a>], and the identification of a limited number of patients with mutations in these genes, has allowed study of the physiological processes that require estrogen in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-84</a>]. The mechanisms of ER-mediated regulation of target genes have been extensively characterized using isolated cells or cell components.</p><p>There is one clinical case of ER resistance in a male patient who harbored a mutation in the <em>Esr1</em> gene resulting in a premature stop codon and no expression of ER protein. Clinical observations of this 28-year-old patient were similar to the experimental ER-knockout animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>]. The male patient was infertile, with low normal sperm counts and low sperm viability, and gonadotropin dysregulation with elevated serum estrogen levels. He also had open epiphyses, osteopenia, obesity, insulin resistance, and premature coronary artery disease. The patient was homozygous for this mutation, which was not spontaneous but resulted from a consanguineous marriage of parents who were second cousins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Genetic analysis of the family members showed Mendelian distribution with two heterozygous sisters who were fertile and non-phenotypic, similar to the animal models.</p><p>A recent report describes a second clinical case of an 18-year-old female with estrogen insensitivity from a point mutation in her <em>Esr1</em> gene resulting in alteration of a glutamic acid residue in the ligand-binding pocket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Unlike the male patient who, like the knockout mouse, did not express ER protein, this female patient expresses a mutated <em>Esr1</em> protein that is functionally inactive. She is unresponsive to her elevated circulating serum estrogen and, like the male patient, has many of the same characteristics as the ER-knockout experimental animal models. She presented with no breast development, delayed puberty, infertility, osteopenia, delayed epiphyseal closure, multicystic ovaries due to pituitary hormonal dysregulation, and high serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-amenorrhea#H272347384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary amenorrhea&quot;, section on 'Estrogen resistance'</a>.)</p><p>Taken together, these two cases of estrogen resistance indicate that mutations in the <em>Esr1</em> gene are not lethal as was previously proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>], and that in both males and females, estrogen and ER are required for epiphyseal closure, maintenance of bone density, and fertility. Identification of additional patients and evaluation of other clinical end points associated with estrogen activity, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular responsiveness, will be needed in order to draw further comparisons of experimental models and clinical estrogen insensitivity.</p><p>As might be expected, the most important defects in these patients and in mouse models are in the reproductive system. Both male and female mice lacking the ER-alpha gene or ER-alpha and -beta genes are infertile, whereas in animals lacking only the ER-beta gene the males are fertile and the females are subfertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. Both male and female ER-alpha knockout rats are infertile as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Mice lacking the membrane guanosine (G) nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor <em>GPR30</em> are fertile, indicating that this receptor is not necessary for reproductive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In mice lacking aromatase, the males are infertile and the females are anovulatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464367590\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene targeted models</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Female reproduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deletion of ER-alpha or aromatase in female mice (or deletion of ER-alpha in rats) results in complete infertility. Deletion of ER-beta in mice results in subfertility, as a result of failure of several components necessary for successful reproduction. Normally, gonadotropin secretion by the pituitary is regulated by a negative feedback loop in which rising serum estrogen concentrations down-regulate transcription of the gene for the beta-subunit of LH, and withdrawal of estrogen by ovariectomy results in an increase in LH secretion. Thus, mice with deletion of ER-alpha or aromatase, rats with ER-alpha deletion, and patients lacking aromatase or ER-alpha have high serum LH concentrations. In contrast, serum LH concentrations are normal in ER-beta-deficient mice, indicating that the negative feedback is mediated by ER-alpha. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the ER-alpha-deleted female mice and rats are normal, and FSH increases in wild type (WT) and ER-alpha-deleted female mice following ovariectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Female mice with mutations that disrupt ER-alpha DNA-binding activity, signaling via activation function (AF)-1 or AF-2, or membrane signaling are also infertile, indicating the importance of all components of ER-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/38,74-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,74-80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Ovary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both ER-alpha and -beta are present in normal mouse ovaries, but their distribution varies. ER-beta is found predominantly in the granulosa cells of the follicles, whereas ER-alpha is found principally in the thecal and interstitial regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>The ovaries of ER-alpha-deficient mice and rats develop hemorrhagic cysts and lack mature follicles and corpora lutea, indicating the absence of ovulation, but they secrete increased amounts of estrogen and testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/61,72,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,72,89</a>], like the ovaries of transgenic mice that overexpress LH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>], indicating that the changes in the ovaries of the ER-alpha-deficient mice are due to LH hypersecretion. Similarly, mice with mutations that disrupt ER-alpha DNA-binding activity, signaling via AF-2, or membrane signaling also exhibit elevated LH and hemorrhagic cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/38,74-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,74-80</a>]. In support of this hypothesis, treatment of ER-alpha-deficient mice with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH) decreases LH secretion and also prevents the ovaries from developing hemorrhagic cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>], similar to the effect from treatment of the ER mutant female patient.</p><p>The ovaries of mice with ER-beta deficiency are morphologically normal. Administration of gonadotropins to these animals also leads to formation of fewer oocytes than are produced by similarly treated WT mice, indicating a role for ER-beta in ovulation as well. When ER-beta-deficient follicles were cultured in vitro, they grew normally until they reached the antral stage, at which time their growth was significantly diminished. In addition, their ovulation rate was significantly lower than that of WT follicles, indicating that in the case of ER-beta deficiency, the defect is intrinsic to the follicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initiation and maintenance of pregnancy are dependent upon ovarian hormones.

The ER-alpha-deficient uterus does not respond to estrogen treatment in terms of weight increase, epithelial proliferation, or induction of estrogen-responsive genes, and therefore cannot support implantation of donor embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/61,72,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,72,89</a>], whereas the aromatase-deficient mouse uterus is estrogen responsive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Mice with mutations that disrupt ER-alpha DNA-binding activity lack uterine responses to estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/38,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,98</a>]. Mice with selective deletion of ER-alpha in uterine epithelial cells initially exhibit a uterine growth response to estrogen, but are unable to maintain the growth, and show a blunted increase in uterine weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Estrogen induces a full uterine growth response in mice with disrupted membrane signaling, indicating that non-genomic signaling does not impact uterine response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Mice with disruption in signaling via AF-2 lack uterine responses to estrogen, but exhibit growth and regulation of transcripts when the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> or the pure antagonist ICI 182 780 are used because of their ability to activate this receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Thus, ovarian dysfunction is not the only component of infertility in ER-alpha-deficient mice and rats.</p><p>In contrast, inefficient ovarian function in ER-beta-deficient mice alone can explain the subfertility in these animals. Overall, it is apparent that ER-alpha is the receptor subtype required for uterine reproductive function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Mammary tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At birth, the rodent mammary gland consists of a rudimentary ductal tree, which, as female rodents mature, elongates in response to estrogen and branches in response to progesterone to fill the stroma.

In mice with the combined deficiency, the ovaries contain some normal follicles, each containing an oocyte, and the granulosa cells and surrounding theca are normal. However, many follicles are abnormal, and when viewed in a two-dimensional section appear similar to seminiferous tubules. These follicles most often lack an oocyte and granulosa cells, but rather have Sertoli-like cells, located along the basement membrane. These latter changes emerge progressively with age, suggesting that these tubular structures represent &quot;ghosts&quot; of follicles in which the oocyte died and the remaining granulosa cells were &quot;trans-differentiated&quot; into Sertoli-like cells.
