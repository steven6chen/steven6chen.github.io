As compared with transthoracic echocardiography, TEE offers superior visualization of posterior cardiac structures because of close proximity of the esophagus to the posteromedial heart with lack of intervening lung and bone. This proximity permits use of high-frequency imaging transducers that afford superior spatial resolution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69251\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69251 \">image 1</a>). </p><p>TEE displays most of the left ventricle (LV) with definition that is equal or superior to that achieved with transthoracic echocardiography. In particular, the full thickness of the myocardium, including the endocardium with its complex endo-architecture, is seen with clarity. However, most TEE views do not fully display the apical portion of the LV, which is truncated or foreshortened. This shortcoming lowers the sensitivity of TEE for detecting a wall motion abnormality limited to the apex, leads to underestimation of chamber volume, and may result in misinterpretation of global LV systolic function. Importantly, the presence of apical thrombus may be missed on TEE alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The use of TEE for the evaluation of the LV will be reviewed here. The specific roles for TEE in ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, and aortic pathology are discussed in detail separately. However, a brief section on the emerging role of TEE in patients with LV assist devices is included here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-aortic-valve-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of aortic valve disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of mitral valve disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1017196716\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT VENTRICULAR ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Linear measurements of the LV diameter are best performed in the transgastric views at the midventricular level. Accuracy is enhanced using simultaneous multiplane views of the short and long axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These measurements should be performed at end-diastole and end-systole and can be used to calculate fractional shortening.</p><p>LV wall thickness can also be measured in these views at end-diastole to detect LV hypertrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTOLIC FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While quantitative methods to measure LV systolic function and ejection fraction by TEE have been described, most TEE evaluation of the LV is qualitative. Studies by anesthesiologists in the operating room have documented the validity of this approach for recognizing hypovolemia, the adverse effects of proximal cross-clamping of the aorta, and the influence of various anesthetic regimens on LV systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. When evaluating LV function, it is important to consider the patient's overall condition. Volume status, sedating medications, and general anesthesia may alter both systolic and diastolic function through their effects on preload and afterload.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ejection fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calculation of end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes by TEE using the biplane method of discs (ie, Simpson's rule) has generally been shown to underestimate LV size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, one study was able to demonstrate a close correlation between TEE and transthoracic echocardiographic measurements of LV volumes and ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A non-volumetric method has been described that accurately estimates LV ejection fraction using the descent of the mitral annulus toward the apex as an index of the shortening of the ventricular long axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Estimates of LV function (global and segmental) should also include a transgastric short-axis view. Although this view must be used with some degree of caution because it excludes the longitudinal motion of the heart (ie, basal descent), it remains a reliable approach for judging LV systolic function. With multiplane and three-dimensional TEE, this view can be supplemented with long-axis gastric views that approach the LV apex in some patients, and reliably image the basal inferior wall. In a study comparing several two-dimensional echocardiographic methods with three-dimensional echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], the ejection fraction obtained using a single-plane method of discs had the best correlation with three-dimensional measurements. In another intraoperative study of 63 patients, three-dimensional echocardiography was feasible approximately 95 percent but provided no clear advantage over two-dimensional methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractional area change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In lieu of LV ejection fraction, the fractional area change or area ejection fraction (normal &gt;36 percent) has been used, mainly for research purposes, for quantifying changes in the short-axis image of the LV. Using manual planimetry of the area circumscribed by the endocardium at end-diastole (EDA) and end-systole (ESA), the fractional area change can be calculated according to the formula:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160;Fractional area change = (EDA - ESA) &divide; EDA</p></div></div><p>The validity of utilizing the fractional area change was evaluated in one study that compared radionuclide blood pool imaging with TEE area ejection fraction in a group of 10 patients in the postsurgical intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. With LV ejection fractions below 45 percent, the correlation between the reference standard blood pool image and the short-axis measured by planimetry was linear; the correlation was poorer when ejection fractions were normal or above normal. However, discriminating among high ejection fractions is of minor clinical importance, and, as a result, use of the fractional short-axis area change can be considered a valid approach. Fractional area change has also been corrected for afterload using the following formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p>FAC afterload corrected (FACac) = FAC x log<sub>10</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">([MAP-RAP]/CI)</span> x 100%</p><p>Studies applying this method in comparison with pressure-volume loops intraoperatively have validated this method as being relatively independent of loading conditions.</p><p>In addition, if one considers that the descent of the cardiac base represents longitudinal muscle function and is among the first properties to be altered in patients with systolic dysfunction, it is to be expected that an index that is blind to longitudinal changes in cardiac dimensions would be less effective once that vector of motion had been suppressed. The reproducibility of measuring the area and fractional change of the short-axis appears to be acceptable for clinical and investigational use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1034768788\"><span class=\"h2\">Strain analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two clinically applicable methods for measuring myocardial deformation and deriving indices of systolic function are tissue Doppler and speckle tracking. These methods have now been applied to transesophageal imaging. Available studies have primarily been performed in the intraoperative setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In one study, tissue Doppler in 19 intraoperative patients was successful in measuring radial strain and strain rate in the transgastric views in contrast to the speckle-tracking method, which was less successful. However, a second study demonstrated that speckle tracking measurements of radial and longitudinal strain were more successful at differentiating between perfused and non-perfused myocardial segments when compared with visual estimation of wall motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Normal values for global strain rate have not been established by transesophageal echocardiography. Normal values for global longitudinal strain using various techniques applied to transthoracic echocardiography range between -16 and -19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Normal radial strain values are between 45 and 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Cardiac output has been measured from the pulmonary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] and LV outflow tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] with the use of velocity-time integrals obtained by pulsed-wave Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] combined with outflow tract diameter estimates of area. Other flow signals, such as transmitral inflow, may also provide cardiac output information. Tissue Doppler measurements of peak systolic myocardial velocity using the basal lateral wall were validated as a measure of systolic LV function against intraoperative pressure-volume loops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Unlike <span class=\"nowrap\">dP/dt</span> derived from the mitral regurgitant jet, the peak systolic myocardial velocity was relatively independent of loading conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6508067\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of regional wall motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in wall motion associated with myocardial ischemia or infarction are characterized by diminished or absent inward endocardial motion and by impaired systolic myocardial thickening. TEE is sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia or prior infarction and is therefore useful for assessment of regional wall motion as well as global LV function.</p><p>As an example, the continuous high-quality imaging of the LV afforded by TEE during surgical procedures makes it ideally suited for the early detection of ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Intraoperative changes in wall motion are more predictive of postoperative ischemia or infarction than ECG changes or hemodynamic abnormalities as documented with Swan-Ganz catheter measurements, such as an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31</a>]. In a study of 98 patients studied before and after the induction of anesthesia prior to coronary artery bypass graft surgery, ischemia as defined by TEE was associated with a small elevation in PCWP (3.5 mmHg); however, a rise in PCWP itself had a low sensitivity and predictive value for myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6508074\"><span class=\"h3\">Views used for evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transverse and longitudinal plane transgastric views are the most widely used for evaluating wall motion abnormalities. Available three-dimensional echocardiographic matrix array transducers can provide simultaneous visualization of multiple planes, which can facilitate rapid assessment of wall motion. The standard transesophageal LV short axis view (horizontal plane) is obtained at the level of the papillary muscle tips. At this level, the myocardium is supplied by all three major coronary vessels and can be divided into four or six segments for standardization purposes: anterior, anterolateral, inferolateral, inferior, inferoseptal, and anteroseptal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104113%7EANEST%2F104112\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104113 graphicRef104112 \">figure 1A-B</a>).</p><p>Continuous imaging of this cross-sectional view forms the basis of monitoring wall motion before and immediately after coronary artery bypass surgery and in high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The longitudinal transgastric view, as well as the esophageal views, provide incremental value in detecting additional ischemic segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6508081\"><span class=\"h3\">Measurement of wall motion abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely employed method for measuring segmental wall motion uses qualitative analysis of endocardial wall motion and segmental thickening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104113%7EANEST%2F104112\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104113 graphicRef104112 \">figure 1A-B</a>).

However, in a study of 102 patients, there was poor correlation between the systolic fraction of pulmonary venous flow, the mitral <span class=\"nowrap\">E/A</span> ratio, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a regression analysis, the limits of agreement exceeded 10 mmHg, rendering this method unreliable for estimating filling pressures intraoperatively. Additionally, there are numerous other conditions that impact pulmonary venous flow patterns including atrial fibrillation and severe mitral regurgitation, in which systolic flow reversal has been described as one of the signs of severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Transmitral inflow and pulmonary vein flow patterns are complementary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As an example, restrictive mitral inflow is characterized by a short isovolumic relaxation time, a normal or slightly elevated peak velocity, a short deceleration time, and a low A wave velocity. These features result in an increased E to A ratio and a pattern known as &quot;pseudonormalization&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72146 \">table 1</a>). A restrictive pattern on mitral inflow and decreased systolic fraction on pulmonary vein inflow permit confident recognition of elevated filling pressure. A prolonged retrograde pulmonary venous A wave and a shortened A wave on mitral inflow also confirm elevated pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1034768875\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue Doppler measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral e' and a' velocities can be measured during transesophageal echocardiography at the lateral annulus.

They may be used as a bridge to transplantation, a bridge to recovery of ventricular dysfunction, or increasingly, as destination therapy. There are a number of devices which all provide continuous flow from the LV to the ascending aorta. TEE is usually performed during the operative insertion of the device. The most common LVAD used in the United States is the HeartMate II, which consists of an inflow cannula in the apex of the LV, the pump, and an outflow cannula to the ascending aorta. On the preimplantation examination, it is important to exclude the presence of thrombi in LV apex and left atrium, to evaluate valvular function, and to examine for the presence of an intracardiac shunt. Postimplantation, the position of the cannula within the LV is evaluated to insure that it is not abutting a wall. It is important to insure adequate but not excessive decompression of the LV. The flow rate of the LVAD should be adjusted such that the position of the intraventricular septum is midline and the aortic valve opens only every third or fourth cycle. The degree of aortic regurgitation should be reassessed and, if significant, aortic valve repair or replacement may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In general, TTE will be adequate in the subsequent follow-up of these patients. Indications for TEE in patients with implanted LVADs include suspected device infection or thrombus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

However, most TEE views do not fully display the apical portion of the LV, which is truncated or foreshortened. This shortcoming lowers the sensitivity of TEE for detecting a wall motion abnormality limited to the apex, leads to underrepresentation of chamber volume, and may result in misinterpretation of global LV systolic function. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While there are well validated quantitative methods to measure LV systolic function and ejection fraction when performing transthoracic echocardiography, most evaluation of the LV by TEE is qualitative. However, qualitative assessment of LV systolic function is generally accurate and has been validated. For the most thorough and accurate estimate of LV systolic function, a transgastric short-axis view of the LV should be obtained in addition to long-axis gastric views that approach the LV apex and demonstrate the basal inferior wall. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Systolic function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TEE can be a useful modality for identifying regional wall motion abnormalities of the LV associated with acute ischemia or prior infarction. (See <a href=\"#H6508067\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of regional wall motion'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apical wall motion abnormalities and, potentially, LV thrombus, may be missed by TEE due to failure to adequately visualize the LV apex. (See <a href=\"#H6508088\" class=\"local\">'Limitations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LV diastolic function can also be evaluated with a combination of techniques, including the transmitral inflow pattern, pulmonary vein inflow, and tissue Doppler imaging.
