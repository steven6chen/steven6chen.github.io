The global burden of tuberculosis (TB), risk factors for transmission, and the epidemiology of TB in the United States will be reviewed here. The epidemiology of drug-resistant TB is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-molecular-mechanisms-of-drug-resistant-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and molecular mechanisms of drug-resistant tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6462182\"><span class=\"h1\">M. TUBERCULOSIS COMPLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. tuberculosis</em> is a member of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex; other members include <em>Mycobacterium africanum</em> and <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em>.</p><p><em>M. africanum</em> is most commonly found in West African countries; it causes up to a quarter of cases of tuberculosis (TB) in the Gambia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The symptoms of infection resemble those of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. The infectivity is similar to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, and it is an important opportunistic pathogen in the setting of advanced immunosuppression due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other causes. Management is identical to management for disease due to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>.</p><p><em>M. bovis</em> is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycobacterium-bovis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOBAL BURDEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than two billion people (about 30 percent of the world population) are estimated to be infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The global incidence of tuberculosis (TB) peaked around 2003 and appears to be declining slowly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, 10.4 million individuals became ill with TB and 1.7 million died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology of TB varies substantially around the world (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55097 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F111123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111123 \">table 1</a>). The highest rates (100 per 100,000 or higher) are observed in sub-Saharan Africa, India, and the islands of Southeast Asia and Micronesia. Intermediate rates of TB (26 to 100 cases per 100,000) occur in China, Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and northern Africa. Low rates (less than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) occur in the United States, Western Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia.</p><p>Poverty, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and drug resistance are major contributors to the resurging global TB epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Approximately 95 percent of TB cases occur in developing countries. Approximately 1 in 9 new TB cases occur in individuals who are infected with HIV; 74 percent of these cases occur in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An estimated 600,000 cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR-) TB or rifampin-resistant TB also occur annually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Strategies and targets for control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After decades of relative neglect, global efforts to control TB were reinvigorated in 1991 when a World Health Assembly resolution recognized TB as a major global health problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The five-element directly observed therapy, short course (DOTS) strategy was developed by the WHO as a response in the mid-1990s; the components included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Government commitment to TB control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Case detection among symptomatic patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standardized chemotherapy for all sputum smear-positive cases under proper case management conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular drug supply</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring system for program supervision and evaluation</p><p/><p>The DOTS framework was subsequently implemented in 184 countries. This change vastly improved the quality and outreach of national TB programs. By 2012, over 83 percent of TB patients treated in DOTS programs worldwide were cured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Several challenges emerged during the implementation of DOTS that were not fully addressed in the original World Health Assembly recommendations. To address these problems, a new plan entitled Stop TB Partnership: The Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015 was developed by the WHO and its partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] and was consistent with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for TB for 2006 to 2015. In addition to enhancing the original elements of DOTS (with a stronger focus on diagnostic accuracy and patient-centered treatment adherence), the following additional control components included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collaborative activities implemented jointly by TB and <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> programs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New treatment strategies to manage MDR-TB</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New community approaches to engage all relevant partners in national TB program implementation, for expansion of equitable access to diagnosis and treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health system strengthening to address impediments to national TB program implementation (eg, limited human resources, financial and managerial capabilities)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Global Drug Facility and the Green Light Committee to improve global access to affordable and quality-assured first- and second-line drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensified research to develop better TB diagnosis, prevention, and treatment tools</p><p/><p>The MDG goals for 2006 to 2015 were to achieve a reduction in global TB incidence, to reduce the number of patients infected with MDR-TB, to increase the number of TB patients who were tested for HIV, to increase the number of HIV-infected TB patients enrolled on antiretroviral treatment, and to increase the number of HIV-infected individuals enrolled in treatment for latent TB infection.</p><p>One difficulty in achieving these goals was the dramatic TB resurgence that occurred in some areas during the 1990s. In Africa, this resurgence was largely due to the HIV epidemic and was compounded by poor access to health services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In Eastern Europe, the resurgence can be attributed to widespread economic decline, secondary declines in the overall quality of health services, poor living conditions, alcoholism, and the emergence of infection due to MDR strains of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>WHO recognizes that controlling the TB epidemic will require programs addressing the large global burden of TB infection, and the 2015 WHO guidelines on management of latent TB infection (LTBI) outline a strategy for identification and treatment of individuals with LTBI at increased risk for progression from latent infection to active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These recommendations, aimed largely at middle- and upper-income countries, recommend focusing efforts on case contacts and individuals with HIV infection, initiating anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment, receiving dialysis, preparing for organ or hematologic transplantation, or with silicosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Progress toward targets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2015 MDG target of reversing TB incidence was achieved, with TB incidence falling globally for several years beginning around 2006, at a rate of 1.5 to 2 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Globally, the TB mortality rate has fallen by 45 percent since 1990. If the slow rate of decline in TB incidence and mortality is not accelerated, TB will continue to be a substantial source of global morbidity and mortality for decades.</p><p>Therefore, new TB goals have been established as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2016 to 2030. The new goals are addressed by the WHO End TB Strategy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F99089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99089 \">table 2</a>) and include a 90 percent reduction in TB deaths and an 80 percent reduction in TB incidence rate by 2030. Accomplishing these goals will require accelerating the decline in TB incidence from the current rate of 1.5 to 2 percent to an annual decline of 15 percent; such a decline could reduce the incidence of TB to &lt;1 case per million by 2050. Achievement of this goal will require improvements in diagnosis, disease treatment completion, and latent infection diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>An estimated 41 percent of patients with TB disease remain undiagnosed. Nearly half of the &quot;missing cases&quot; occur in Indonesia, India, and Nigeria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Data on treatment success rates follow similar geographic patterns, although these rates reflect only the proportion of patients who received treatment. It is sometimes uncertain whether these patients completed an effective treatment course. The western Pacific and eastern Mediterranean have the greatest success (91 to 92 percent); other regions have fared less well (76 to 81 percent). Success is limited in part by the high prevalence of HIV infection in Africa and drug resistance in Eastern Europe.</p><p>Most patients who are coinfected with TB and HIV are not recognized to be coinfected. For example, the worldwide percentage of patients with TB disease who underwent subsequent HIV testing improved only marginally (from 1 to 55 percent) during the time period 2002 to 2015.</p><p>Detection and treatment of MDR-TB are also inadequate. The WHO estimates that only 57 percent of patients with MDR-TB were identified in 2015 and, of those, only 38 percent were started on second-line treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Socioeconomic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Socioeconomic development and access to quality of health services appear to be at least as important as any specific TB control measure. The likelihood of success of TB control efforts is likely related to socioeconomic indicators, including gross domestic product per capita, mortality of children &lt;5, access to clean water, and adequate sanitation and health expenditure per capita [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Moreover, the 2016 to 2030 SDGs for TB recognize that TB treatment forces many patients and their families into poverty; thus, an important goal is that &quot;no affected families face catastrophic costs related to TB.&quot;</p><p>The importance of addressing these socioeconomic factors to achieve TB control is reinforced by the fact that many countries have experienced a rapid decline in TB burden without good access to high-quality TB treatment. In Europe, for example, TB morbidity and mortality declined long before effective chemotherapy was available, largely because of socioeconomic development, improved living conditions, better nutrition, and isolation of infectious cases in sanatoria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">IN THE UNITED STATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following a marked decline in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States over several decades, the incidence rose in the period 1985 to 1992 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Since 1992, there has been a substantial decline in the rate of TB; in 2014, it fell to a historic low of 2.9 per 100,000 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66025 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In 2016, it remained at 2.9 per 100,000, suggesting that the momentum toward elimination of TB in the United States has stalled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A majority of TB cases in the United States now occurs in foreign-born individuals emigrating from countries with high rates of endemic TB (68 percent of United States TB cases in 2016; the case rate in this group is 14.6 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Of these cases, roughly half occur in individuals residing in the United States for &le;5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis has demonstrated that most of these cases are due to reactivation of latent infection rather than transmission within communities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>]. Therefore, screening for and treatment of latent infection can be a useful prevention tool among foreign-born individuals.</p><p>Increased travel and immigration of individuals from countries with endemic TB are certain to bring new challenges to TB control. In 2000, it was estimated that 11 million individuals with latent TB (with capacity for future reactivation) reside in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The countries accounting for the majority of cases of TB in foreign-born persons in the United States are Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, China, and the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The states accounting for the greatest number of United States cases are California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, and Florida (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66885\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66885 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>According to data from the United States National TB Surveillance System, 5.0 percent of TB patients in 2016 were known to be HIV infected; greater than 86 percent of TB patients in the United States received HIV testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. HIV infection rates in TB patients were highest among injection drug users, homeless persons, correctional facility inmates, and alcoholics (35, 22, 16, and 15 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18203424\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis in the United States has been shown to be seasonal, with a peak in the spring and a trough in the fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Latitude-dependent factors, including reduced winter sunlight and its potential effect on vitamin D levels, do not appear to contribute significantly to seasonality in the United States. Instead, seasonality appears to be greater among clustered cases and children, groups in whom disease likely reflects recent transmission of tuberculosis. Therefore, tuberculosis disease resulting from recent infection with early progression to disease appears to be more influenced by season than disease that results from activation of latent tuberculosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) may be divided as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired immunity (host factors)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased exposure to infectious persons (environmental factors)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Host factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Categories of host factors are outlined in the following sections.

The magnitude of risk is likely variable depending on the degree of HIV-induced immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/14,32,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,32,38,39</a>].</p><p>The WHO estimated 10.4 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases in 2016, 10 percent of whom were people living with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The 2016 estimated incidence of TB by country and the prevalence of HIV in TB cases by country are summarized in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F98732\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98732 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55097 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The global incidence of new TB cases among HIV-infected patients has declined marginally since 2005. Between 2004 and 2015, deaths have declined from just over 500,000 in 2004 to 374,000 in 2016, largely due to increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p><p>A large proportion of the global burden of HIV-associated TB occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, with 75 percent of new cases of TB and 86 percent of deaths. The burden is particularly high in southern Africa, where some countries have annual TB incidence rates exceeding 750 per 100,000 population.</p><p>Dual infection with HIV and TB leads to reciprocal interactions that have significant clinical impact, as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1945117429\"><span class=\"h5\">Effect of HIV on TB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of TB doubles within the first year of HIV seroconversion due to rapid depletion of TB-specific T helper cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Thereafter, the risk of TB progressively increases with declining immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/37,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,43-45</a>].</p><p>HIV-infected individuals appear to be more likely to acquire <em>M. tuberculosis</em> if exposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>], and they are also at increased risk of developing active TB from reactivated latent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, HIV infection is a risk factor for accelerated progression of TB following exposure; in one study, the duration of TB disease prior to diagnosis was estimated to be three times shorter in HIV-infected patients than in HIV-uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The risk of disease and death from TB is substantially increased among HIV-infected individuals due to reactivation from preexisting latent TB and in the setting of new TB infection with rapid progression of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-53</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In low-incidence settings with low transmission risk, the rate of progression to active TB disease is 3 to 13 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/37,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,45</a>]; the higher risk occurs in patients with CD4 &lt;200 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In two nosocomial TB outbreaks described in the United States and Italy, the risk of TB disease following exposure was 37 to 50 percent in individuals with HIV infection and no known prior exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In high-incidence settings with high transmission risk, the likelihood of progression to active TB disease is generally higher.

In a cohort of individuals with advanced HIV infection in South Africa, the incidence of active TB was 68 per 100 person-years, likely the result of new infection and prevalent latent TB infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p>The risk of TB transmission from HIV-infected patients with TB is lower than the risk of TB transmission from HIV-uninfected patients with TB; this is because of the shorter disease duration as well as the higher proportion of sputum smear-negative TB seen with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-tuberculosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Worldwide, about 95 percent of TB cases occur in developing countries. Among all new TB cases in 2016, 10 percent were estimated to be HIV infected; 74 percent of these cases occur in Africa. In that year, there were an estimated 600,000 cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR-) TB.
