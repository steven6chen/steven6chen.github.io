In a woman, the reproductive system includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus (or womb), the organ that holds a baby when a woman is pregnant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ovaries, the organs that release eggs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fallopian tubes, which connect the ovaries to the uterus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vagina, which connects the uterus to the outside of the body</p><p/><p>PID is most commonly caused by an infection you catch during sex. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are two of the most common infections that lead to PID. PID can cause ongoing (also called &quot;chronic&quot;) pain. It can also leave you unable to have a baby, because PID can cause scars to form on the fallopian tubes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5948412\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PID?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PID does not always cause symptoms. When it does, the main symptom is pain in the lower belly. In some women, this pain gets worse during sex.</p><p>Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid leaking from the vagina (called &quot;discharge&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding or spotting from the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain during a pelvic exam</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5948426\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for PID?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no simple test that can show whether or not you have PID. But there are a few tests that can help your doctor or nurse find the possible cause of your problem.</p><p>First, your doctor or nurse will do a pelvic exam to check for signs of infection or inflammation. Then, he or she might test your urine, blood, or vaginal discharge for signs of infection or other problems. He or she might also check a sample of your bowel movements to see if there's blood in it.</p><p>Depending on your situation, you might also have other tests, such as an ultrasound. An ultrasound is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of your body. It is painless.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5948441\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes! If you think you might have PID, it is very important find out and to start treatment right away. The longer you wait to get treated, the more likely you are to develop long-term problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5948458\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PID treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PID is treated with antibiotics. These antibiotics come in different forms, and not everyone takes them in the same way. Some people get a shot plus pills. Some people need to get the antibiotics in the hospital through an &quot;IV&quot; first and then take pills when they go home. Your doctor will decide which treatment is best for you.</p><p>It is very important to take all the pills in your prescription, even if you feel better before you finish them. If you don't take all the pills, the infection could come back.</p><p>If you have PID, your recent sex partners also need to see a doctor and get treatment. This includes anyone you had sex with in the 2 months before your symptoms started. If your sex partners are not treated, they can infect you again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5948473\"><span class=\"h1\">Can PID be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since PID is most commonly caused by a germ that you get during sex, you can lower your risk of getting PID by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a latex condom every time you have sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having sex with a partner who has symptoms of an infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having sex at all</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5948490\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have had<strong> </strong>PID, you could have a hard time getting pregnant. That's because PID can cause scars to form on the fallopian tubes. If you do get pregnant, you will also have a higher-than-average chance of having an ectopic pregnancy, which can be dangerous. An ectopic pregnancy is when a baby starts to form in the fallopian tube, which then can burst.</p><p>If you are trying to get pregnant, be sure to tell your doctor or nurse that you have had PID.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5948507\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
