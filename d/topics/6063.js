Partial gastrectomy with reconstruction can be performed to treat complications of peptic ulcer disease (such as perforation, bleeding, penetration, and duodenal stricture) or gastric carcinoma localized at the antrum. This reconstruction technique was named after Theodor Billroth, who first performed it in January 1885. Although significantly less often performed in recent years for complications of peptic ulcer disease because of changes in management (H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors), the Billroth II operation remains a commonly used reconstruction after distal stomach resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=partial-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction#H182357342\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Partial gastrectomy and gastrointestinal reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal reconstruction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction#H465975840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total gastrectomy and gastrointestinal reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p>Because of the surgically altered anatomy, diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is more difficult in patients with previous Billroth II gastrectomy compared with patients with native anatomy. The papillary area in the second part of the duodenum can only be reached through the afferent loop. As a result, the papilla of Vater appears upside-down compared with its orientation during standard ERCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60974 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The endoscopist performing ERCP in a Billroth II patient has to consider and overcome the following issues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choosing the appropriate endoscope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Entering the afferent loop</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reaching the duodenal stump</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannulating the papilla from a reverse position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performing an endoscopic sphincterotomy</p><p/><p>These considerations were addressed by a number of specialists shortly after the introduction of ERCP in 1968 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and endoscopic sphincterotomy in 1973 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Some authorities advocate the routine use of forward-viewing endoscopes (eg, gastroscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>] or even pediatric colonoscopes to manage long afferent loops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) because they are easier to use and can facilitate recognition of the afferent loop. The major drawback of forward-viewing endoscopes is the lack of an elevator at the operative channel once the papillary area has been reached. At present, most specialists recommend the routine use of a side-viewing duodenoscope for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in Billroth II patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and forward-viewing endoscopes should be reserved for use after a failed attempt with the duodenoscope. On the other hand, the use of forward-viewing endoscopes has been recommended when the endoscopist is not experienced or the patient volume is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>This issue of which scope to use was addressed in a randomized trial that included 45 patients with a Billroth II gastrectomy who were assigned to ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy using either a forward- or side-viewing endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Cannulation was more often successful with the forward-viewing instrument (87 versus 68 percent). In patients in whom cannulation was successful, the rate of successful sphincterotomy was comparable between the groups (83 versus 80 percent, respectively). Another possible advantage of the forward-viewing endoscope was a lower rate of complications; jejunal perforation occurred in four patients with the side-viewing endoscope compared with none with the forward-viewing endoscope.</p><p>However, a major limitation of this study was the type of side-viewing endoscope used: the TJF V10, which has a long and potentially harmful distal end. The only jejunal perforation reported in another series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] occurred with the same type of scope, which was very soon replaced by the TJF 100, a scope with a smooth, regular distal end that maintains a 4.2 mm wide operative channel. Thus, while the risk of jejunal perforation occurring during progression within the afferent loop is not entirely absent with the currently available therapeutic duodenoscopes, it should be significantly lower than in the above series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, all series of ERCP in Billroth II patients have described serious perforations; one series described a perforation rate of 6 percent with 82 percent requiring laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Outcomes of ERCP in 713 patients with Billroth II gastric resections who underwent 1050 ERCPs were examined in a report from the Catholic University in Rome (over a 30-year period) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The ERCPs were always started with a side-viewing endoscope, and a forward-viewing endoscope was used only as a second choice after a failed approach with a side-viewing endoscope. Overall, successful duodenal intubation was obtained in 618 patients (87 percent), in 600 patients by using a duodenoscope (97 percent), and in 18 patients with a forward-viewing endoscope (3 percent). In 95 patients (13 percent), the procedure was aborted: in 73 patients (77 percent) because of a long and tortuous jejunal afferent loop, in 19 patients (20 percent) because of jejunal perforation, and in 3 patients (3 percent) for other reasons. When the duodenal stump was successfully intubated, biliary or pancreatic duct cannulation was successful in 94 percent of cases. In 78 patients (13 percent), a purely diagnostic procedure was performed. Pancreatic interventions were performed in 23 patients (4 percent), common bile duct stones were removed in 318 patients (55 percent), 1 patient underwent endoscopic papillectomy, and plastic or metal stents were placed in 158 patients (27 percent).</p><p>Complications included 22 perforations (2.1 percent of procedures, 3.1 percent of patients). Nineteen were afferent jejunal loop perforations (all surgically treated) and three were retroperitoneal perforations (all managed conservatively). There were 23 other major complications (3.2 percent of patients): delayed bleeding requiring hemostasis in 11 cases (1.5 percent), mild pancreatitis in 5 cases (0.7 percent), severe cholangitis after 5 procedures (0.7 percent), and respiratory failure requiring intensive care after 2 procedures (0.2 percent). Two patients died because of complications related to a jejunal perforation (0.3 percent).</p><p>Similar experience has been described in several other series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/3,7,8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8,15</a>], with only a few exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. By contrast, preferential use of a forward-viewing endoscope has been associated with a lower success rate. In a series of 56 patients, for example, a forward-viewing endoscope was associated with successful afferent loop entrance in only 77 percent, cannulation in 81 percent of those with successful afferent loop entrance, and an overall success rate of Billroth II ERCP of only 63 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Ten of the failed cases were retried by side-viewing duodenoscope; five were successfully completed.</p><p>The use of dual-lumen gastroscope and cap-assisted ERCP have been used in an attempt to improve the success of ERCP with a forward-viewing endoscope.</p><p>A dual-lumen forward-viewing gastroscope with two channels can also be used to perform ERCP in patients with a Billroth II gastrectomy, but this endoscope has a large diameter of (12.6 mm) and is not equipped with a lift clamp (elevator) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Cap-assisted ERCP with a forward-viewing gastroscope was reported as a helpful technique in cases when a side-viewing duodenoscope or a gastroscope without a cap failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. </p><p><strong>Retrieval balloon-assisted enterography with side-viewing endoscope</strong> &mdash; Retrieval balloon-assisted enterography has been used for entering the appropriate loop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a retrospective study that included a total of 220 consecutive patients who had previously undergone gastrectomy and were referred for ERCP, all ERCP procedures were performed using a conventional side-viewing duodenoscope. In 160 patients who had undergone a Billroth II gastroenterostomy and total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, retrieval balloon-assisted enterography was performed. Success rates for cannulation of the papilla and ERCP were 89 and 86 percent, respectively. The procedure-related complication rate was 6 percent. This included one afferent loop perforation that required surgery. There were no procedure-related deaths. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Entering the afferent loop'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2489902\"><span class=\"h2\">Other endoscopes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oblique-viewing endoscope &ndash; The ideal instrument for ERCP in patients with surgically altered anatomy would blend the best features of both the forward-viewing endoscope and the side-viewing duodenoscope, including an elevator and an angle of view that is a compromise between the two instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some reports from Japan appear to support the use of an oblique-viewing endoscope in patients with prior Billroth II gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The effectiveness and safety of an anterior oblique-viewing endoscope has been evaluated in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. In a retrospective study involving 25 patients (30 procedures) with Billroth II gastrectomy and intact papilla who underwent ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The overall rate of reaching the papilla was 87 percent (26 of 30), and the overall rate of biliary cannulation and treatment success was 100 percent (26 of 26). The complication rate was 3.3 percent (1 of 30): a case of mild pancreatitis and no perforations. However, oblique-viewing endoscopes are not commercially available in Western countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multibending endoscope &ndash; The utility of a multibending, forward-viewing endoscope for selective cannulation during ERCP in patients with a Billroth II gastrectomy has been reported in a case series (14 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A novel multibending, backward-oblique-viewing duodenoscope was evaluated in 23 patients with native papilla, including two patients with Billroth I gastrectomy; in all patients, biliary cannulation and therapeutic procedures were successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteroscopy &ndash; Intubation of the duodenal stump using conventional forward- or side-viewing endoscopes may occasionally be impossible in patients with a relatively long afferent loop. An increasing number of case reports have described success using balloon-assisted enteroscopy (both double- and single-balloon endoscopy) in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y anastomosis, but experience is still limited and the necessary equipment (including long ERCP catheters) is not widely available. Short-type enteroscopes were recently developed, and both short double-balloon and short single-balloon enteroscopy are suitable for ERCP. A short-type double-balloon enteroscope has a 2.8 mm working channel and a 152 cm working length. Its advantage is that it can accommodate most conventional accessories for ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A prototype short single-balloon enteroscope has a shorter working length (152 cm) and a wider channel (3.2 mm) than the conventional enteroscope (2.8 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. According to preliminary experiences, these short enteroscopes appear safe and effective for use in ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-deep-small-bowel-enteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>A questionnaire survey was conducted in 2012 in Japan regarding ERCP in patients with surgically altered anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This series of 273 patients who underwent 490 ERCP procedures included 69 patients with Billroth II gastrectomy, and among them the range of the endoscopes used included short single- and double-balloon enteroscopes (29 cases), long double-balloon enteroscopes (one case), oblique-viewing endoscopes (25 cases), forward-viewing endoscopes (9 cases), pediatric colonoscopes (3 cases), and unknown endoscope type in 2 cases. The success rate was higher in patients with Billroth II reconstruction, 98.6 percent (68 out of 69) compared with 90.7 percent (382 out of 421) in other patients (Roux-en-Y reconstruction, pancreaticoduodenectomy, hepaticojejunostomy, liver transplantation, and interposition after total gastrectomy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17696948\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performing an ERCP in patients with Billroth II anatomy requires that the afferent loop be identified and entered, that the duodenal stump be reached, and that the papilla be cannulated. In many cases, an endoscopic sphincterotomy is also performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Entering the afferent loop</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first problem to be solved when attempting ERCP in patients with Billroth II anatomy is identification of the afferent loop at the site of the gastrojejunostomy. The loop adjacent to the lesser curve is usually examined first since it is more likely to lead to the afferent loop. However, fluoroscopy is often more accurate in showing the direction toward the right hypochondrium.</p><p>Entering the afferent loop is sometimes extremely difficult, especially when the lesser curve remnant is short and the anastomosed loop is &quot;hung up.&quot; When using a side-viewing duodenoscope, the endoscopic procedure is usually started with the patient lying in the left lateral position. However, turning the patient to the supine or prone position may improve the axis and facilitate introduction of the scope into the stoma.</p><p>If these maneuvers are unsuccessful, the stoma can be cannulated with a J-tipped Teflon-coated or stiff hydromer-coated guidewire that is subsequently made rigid using a 10 French biliary bougie-type dilator (Soehendra dilator). The scope can then be pushed over the bougie, which acts as a straightener. Similar techniques using a biopsy forceps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or a polypectomy snare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] have also been described but are probably less effective and riskier. All these maneuvers are safer and more effective if performed with close radiologic monitoring. Another useful technique for safely entering the appropriate loop using a conventional side-viewing duodenoscope is retrieval balloon-assisted enterography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/20,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29</a>]. The guidewire of the retrieval balloon is advanced to the appropriate limb, and then a retrieval balloon is inserted over the guidewire. Following injection of contrast agent, the target limb is radiologically explored. Then the balloon is hooked to the limb, and while the balloon catheter is retracted into the working channel, the scope can advance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reaching the duodenal stump</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique of scope progression into the afferent loop closely resembles techniques used during colonoscopy. One or more straightening maneuvers are often necessary to manage long loops and to obtain a better working position when the tip of the scope faces the papillary area. Straightening maneuvers may occasionally employ a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of 360 degrees that requires detaching the scope insertion from the video-processor to avoid a complete loop on the scope light-cable. Having the scope in the &quot;short&quot; position (straightened scope) allows precise maneuvers during attempts at cannulation.</p><p>Moving the patient to the supine position often facilitates progression of the scope into the afferent loop because it allows more precise radiologic orientation. In addition, infusion of contrast into the jejunal loop by air insufflation or by contrast injection through the operative channel helps to define the bowel anatomy when acute angles hinder progression of the scope. The supine position also permits hand compression over the abdomen to reduce loops formed by the endoscope.</p><p>Other authors suggest that the use of a cap-fitted, frontal-viewing endoscope could be a major advantage for afferent loop identification, intubation of the duodenal stump, and duct cannulation. The cap could provide a fixed distance between the jejunal wall and the tip of the endoscope, and thus improve the identification of sharp angulations. It also displaces the jejunal folds during the progression of the endoscope and reduces the need for air inflation and, consequently, loop formation. Furthermore, the cap could help biliary cannulation by fixing the tip of the endoscope in the appropriate position in front of the papilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cannulating the papilla from the reverse position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the side-viewing duodenoscope, the papilla of Vater appears in a completely reverse position to its orientation during standard ERCP. Cannulation and injection of the pancreatic duct is usually not a major problem because the duct joins the duodenum at a favorable angle. However, bile duct cannulation is more demanding.</p><p>Since the majority of cannulas tend to assume an upward curve, most authorities use a straight catheter to improve the axis toward the biliary direction (ie, 5 to 6 o'clock, which is the opposite of the routine position in patients with unaltered gastroduodenal anatomy). The biliary orientation of the catheter may be further increased by slightly pulling back the duodenoscope, bending the tip of the duodenoscope toward the duodenal wall, and pushing the catheter while keeping its tip in contact with the papillary orifice.</p><p>It is sometimes useful to modify the tip of the catheter by bending the distal part into a sigmoid shape. Every manipulation of the catheter should be carefully monitored with fluoroscopy, which is often much more helpful than the endoscopic view. When the papilla is close to or within a duodenal &quot;cul-de-sac,&quot; cannulation may be more demanding or sometimes impossible. Other anatomic abnormalities such as parapapillary diverticula may hinder cannulation as in the patient with native anatomy.</p><p>As discussed above, a side-viewing duodenoscope with an elevator is a major advantage in this phase of the procedure. Compared with the forward-viewing scope, it permits much more precise manipulation of catheters.</p><p>Deep cannulation of the bile duct is as important in patients with Billroth II anatomy as in those with native anatomy. Catheters accepting a 0.035 inch guide-wire (which can be left in place to guide further therapeutic maneuvers) should be encouraged. The guidewire biliary cannulation technique may increase the cannulation rate in comparison with the standard contrast-assisted cannulation technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and the loop-tip wire could be an alternative accessory for wire-assisted selective cannulation in patients with Billroth anastomosis, as well as in difficult cannulation cases with a normal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, there are only limited data comparing cannulation success rate with different types of guidewire.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic sphincterotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many techniques have been proposed for performing endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with Billroth II anatomy. As mentioned above, the main technical problem is due to the reverse position of the papilla in the endoscopic field. Because of this, the wire of the sphincterotome should cut, ideally, in a 6 o'clock direction. Sphincterotomes designed to facilitate this orientation have been available for more than 20 years. One design, for example, involved a sigmoid-shaped sphincterotome that had a long distal tip (long &quot;nose&quot;), which was supposed to rotate once deeply inserted into the common bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Several other groups have designed similar catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/4,10,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,34,35</a>].</p><p>All of these devices require deep cannulation of the common bile duct, which guarantees the sphincterotomy to be as safe as possible, provided it is correctly directed. However, most of these sphincterotomes have proved difficult to orient properly during routine use. As a result, some authorities use a needle knife to carry out a complete &quot;freehand&quot; cutting of the papillary roof [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This method, although simple and effective in expert hands, does not meet any of the safety criteria accepted for the non-gastrectomized patient, particularly since it does not require deep cannulation of the common bile duct. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precut-access-papillotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precut (access) papillotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The &quot;freehand&quot; technique was later replaced by the &quot;over-the-stent&quot; needle knife technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This modification offers the advantage of a controlled cutting direction, thanks to a previously inserted biliary stent, and is now widely used in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Nevertheless, both techniques probably carry a higher risk of retroperitoneal perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Balloon dilation of the papilla (&quot;sphincteroplasty&quot; or &quot;sphincteroclasy&quot;) has also been suggested as an alternative technique to avoid technical problems of endoscopic sphincterotomy in Billroth II patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/5,18,19,39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18,19,39-43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-balloon-dilatation-for-removal-of-bile-duct-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic balloon dilatation for removal of bile duct stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Therapeutic maneuvers that can be performed in the patient with unaltered gastroduodenal anatomy, such as stone extraction, drain insertion, and stent placement, are also feasible in patients with Billroth II anatomy once access to the bile duct has been obtained via endoscopic sphincterotomy or sphincteroplasty. Use of balloon dilation in conjunction with limited sphincterotomy can permit effective and safe management of patients with difficult, large bile duct stones, rather than relying on sphincterotomy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. All of these procedures should be performed only by highly experienced endoscopists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>A study from Korea evaluated the efficacy and safety of endoscopic papillary balloon dilation using a cap-fitted forward-viewing endoscope in 36 patients (44 ERCP procedures) who underwent Billroth II gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Selective bile duct cannulation was performed in 32 patients (89 percent). Papillary balloon dilation was performed in all 32 patients, and additional endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in four patients. Cardiovascular adverse events with transient hypoxia occurred in two patients, and perforations were observed in three patients (8.3 percent). Out of the three perforations, two were type III (ductal injury) and one was type IV (retroperitoneal air without symptoms), and only one patient needed surgical treatment.</p><p>The records for Billroth II gastrectomy patients who underwent ERCP using a cap-fitted forward-viewing endoscope with endoscopic papillary balloon dilation at five institutions between 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. ERCP was technically successful in 144 out of 165 cases (87 percent) and clinically successful in 141 patients (86 percent). Complications occurred in 16 patients (9.7 percent): perforation in 3 cases (1.8 percent) and pancreatitis in 13 cases (7.9 percent). In multivariable analysis, &gt;2 ERCP sessions and a common bile duct stone size &gt;12 mm were found to be significantly associated with ERCP-related adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Between 2006 and 2013, 77 patients with Billroth II anatomy in whom standard ERCP had failed underwent 92 sessions of ERCP with a long or short double-balloon enteroscope, and 48 patients with common bile duct stones underwent therapy with endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The overall rate of reaching the papilla was 95 percent (73 of 77 patients), and the treatment success rate was 92 percent (67 of 73 patients). The complication rate was 6.5 percent (5 of 77 patients): three cases of perforations (two minor perforations related to endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation and one <span class=\"nowrap\">enteroscope/overtube-related</span> intestinal perforation) and two cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">enteroscope/overtube-related</span> intestinal mucosal tear.</p><p>Pancreatic sphincterotomy at the major papilla, as well as minor papilla sphincterotomy, have also been performed safely in the setting of various pancreatic diseases (mainly chronic pancreatitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>] in patients with Billroth II anatomy by adapting the technique to the modified endoscopic view and following the same principles as for biliary sphincterotomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H198534430\"><span class=\"h2\">Success rate, complications and alternative interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ERCP in patients with surgically altered anatomy is still challenging even among experts. Years ago, after the introduction of ERCP, the success rate for cannulating the desired duct (bile duct or pancreatic duct) in surgically altered anatomy, such as Billroth II gastrectomy, was just above 50 percent, while the overall success rate for selective cannulation was approximately 90 percent in patients with normal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. More recently, the ERCP success rate has improved as a result of the advent of new instruments, accessories, and techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, when successful cannulation fails using all available techniques,<strong> </strong>repeated attempts at cannulation can increase the risk of small bowel perforation. Indeed, wall intestinal perforation is the most frequent serious complication in this context, so clinicians should consider alternative approaches, such as surgery or percutaneous approach in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17696866\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Billroth II operation entails partial gastrectomy with end-to-side gastrojejunostomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60887 \">figure 11</a>).
