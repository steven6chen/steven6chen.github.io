This review will discuss the clinical aspects of MMN. Other immune-mediated neuropathies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-mediated-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune-mediated neuropathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197848989\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MMN is considered an immune-mediated disorder given the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical improvement with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of anti-GM1 antibodies in many but not all patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A perivascular lymphocytic infiltration observed on nerve biopsy in some reports</p><p/><p>However, it is unclear whether anti-GM1 antibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of MMN or are merely an epiphenomenon of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although MMN is associated with conduction block on electrodiagnostic studies, segmental nerve demyelination is not a consistent feature of MMN, and some degree of axonal loss is often present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One hypothesis is that the conduction block may be caused by an antibody-mediated attack affecting sodium channels and other nerve components at the nodes of Ranvier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126381447\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MMN is a rare condition. The estimated prevalence of MMN is 0.6 to 2 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Men are affected more frequently than women, with a ratio of 2.7:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Disease onset usually occurs between ages 20 to 50 years, with a mean onset ranging from age 30 to 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126379997\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical clinical presentation of MMN is one of subacute onset with asymmetric weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lower motor neuron signs often present in a bibrachial pattern, producing arm and hand weakness without associated sensory loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The weakness usually begins as a focal mononeuropathy affecting the distal arms; wrist drop and hand weakness are common initial symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, MMN can also present the legs. In one series of 88 patients, onset of muscle weakness involving the distal arm or distal leg was noted in 61 and 34 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In patients with arm onset, progression usually involves spread of the weakness to the contralateral arm followed by the legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some patients develop fasciculations or cramps. Muscle atrophy occurs late in the course of the disease. Deep tendon reflexes are variably affected, being decreased in most cases but normal or brisk (but not pathologic) in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cranial nerves, bulbar muscles, and respiratory muscles are most often spared in MMN.</p><p>The neuronal involvement in MMN is typically patchy, with some nerves unaffected and others severely involved. Motor nerve conduction studies often show evidence of conduction block, representing focal demyelination. Sensory conduction through the same segment of nerve is normal. Elevated titers of anti-GM1 antibodies may be seen in 30 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/2,8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,11,12</a>], but it is uncertain whether these antibodies play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cerebrospinal fluid protein is normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126380003\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of MMN is suspected on the basis of a compatible clinical presentation with progressive, usually asymmetric weakness without sensory abnormalities, upper motor neuron signs, or bulbar involvement. The diagnosis is supported by nerve conduction studies that demonstrate focal demyelination and conduction block (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;, section on 'Conduction block'</a>) in motor nerves and normal sensory nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, some patients have a similar clinical disorder but lack conduction block on nerve conduction studies, and this has been termed multifocal motor neuropathy without conduction block or MMNWOCB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/9,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13-15</a>]. In these patients who lack conduction block, responsiveness to treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> is another supportive feature for the diagnosis of MMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/3,9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,16</a>].</p><p>Of note, conduction block can be missed on routine nerve conduction studies, particularly if demyelination is proximal or patchy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, an extensive survey of multiple nerves in upper and lower limbs should be performed, including late responses (F waves and H reflex) to assess proximal nerve segments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197850503\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic criteria for MMN have been proposed by the European Federation of Neurological <span class=\"nowrap\">Societies/Peripheral</span> Nerve Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(EFNS/PNS)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The two core criteria for MMN (both must be present) are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slowly progressive or stepwise progressive, focal, asymmetric limb weakness, that is, motor involvement in the motor nerve distribution of at least two nerves, for more than one month.

However, unlike CIDP, MMN is generally unresponsive to glucocorticoids or plasma exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and these therapies have been associated with clinical worsening in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23,24</a>]. We suggest IVIG, 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> given over two to five days, for initial treatment of patients with MMN who require treatment due to disease progression or disability. Our preferred regimen is 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> daily for five consecutive days. This recommendation is consistent with current guidelines from the European Federation of Neurological <span class=\"nowrap\">Societies/Peripheral</span> Nerve Society and the American Academy of Neurology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>].</p><p>The benefit of IVIG for MMN has been demonstrated in several small randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/18-21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21,25,26</a>]. As an example, a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial evaluated IVIG (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day for five consecutive days once a month for three months) versus placebo in 18 patients with MMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At four months, seven of nine patients who received IVIG responded, compared with two of nine patients treated with placebo. Although data are less compelling, subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (SCIG) therapy may also be beneficial for MMN, as reported in a meta-analysis that included mainly small observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Most patients experience fairly rapid improvement in weakness with IVIG, but the improvement is generally not sustained beyond a few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, maintenance IVIG infusions are typically required every two to six weeks. For patients who require maintenance IVIG infusions, subsequent dosing can be tailored to the individual patient based upon clinical response. Some patients will continue to require full dose IVIG, while others will respond to lower doses. Maintenance IVIG is usually administered over a shorter time period if the initial five-day course is well-tolerated. As an example, full dose maintenance IVIG (total 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> might be administered at <span class=\"nowrap\">1g/kg</span> daily for two days.</p><p>For patients with severe or progressive disease that is refractory to, or becomes resistant to, IVIG therapy, options and evidence are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Several reports suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> is partially effective for treating MMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/8,23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23,29</a>], but its use may be associated with serious toxicity. Responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> was reported in a few cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], but rituximab was not associated with improvement on any outcome measures in a series of six patients with MMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126380809\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of MMN is one of slow progression of disease and disability in untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifocal-motor-neuropathy/abstract/1,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33</a>].
