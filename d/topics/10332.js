Diarrhea caused by chemotherapy, referred to here as chemotherapy-related diarrhea (CRD), is a common problem in cancer patients and is most often described with fluoropyrimidines (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> [FU] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>. Diarrhea is often the dose-limiting and major toxicity of regimens containing a fluoropyrimidine with irinotecan. The frequency of severe (grade 3 or 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65649 \">table 1</a>)) diarrhea with these agents ranges from 5 to 44 percent, and rates vary according to the dose, the specific agents administered, and the schedule of administration.

In general, secretory diarrhea characteristically continues despite fasting, is associated with stool volumes &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day,</span> and occurs day and night, in contrast to osmotic diarrhea, in which these characteristics are uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents#H612325409\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis/mechanisms'</a>.) </p><p>Briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> can cause damage to the intestinal mucosa, leading to loss of epithelium and secretory diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 10 percent of patients being treated with FU have decreased expression of the enzyme lactase in their intestinal brush border, leading to lactose intolerance and causing osmotic diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early-onset diarrhea with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> (ie, during or within several hours of drug infusion) is cholinergically mediated (ie, related to increased motility) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, late irinotecan-associated diarrhea is not cholinergically mediated but, instead, appears to be multifactorial, with contributions from dysmotility and secretory factors, as well as a direct toxic effect on the intestinal mucosa.

Excessive gas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intestinal cramping commonly accompanies CRD. As the CRD progresses, it can become severe, with frequent watery stools. CRD can be debilitating and, in some cases, life-threatening. Findings in such patients include volume depletion, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte disorders such as hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and depending upon water intake, hyponatremia (increased water intake that cannot be excreted because of the hypovolemic stimulus to the release of antidiuretic hormone) or hypernatremia (insufficient water intake to replace losses). Infection, including life-threatening sepsis, can result due to breach of the intestinal mucosa, which is worsened in the setting of chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents#H343979093\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Given the risk for dehydration and infection, severe CRD frequently requires hospital admission for adequate supportive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Other sequelae of CRD include increased cost of care, reduced quality of life, treatment delays, and diminished compliance with treatment regimens, which may compromise long-term outcomes if the chemotherapy is being administered with curative intent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3296160038\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of chemotherapy-related diarrhea (CRD) is often described using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grades; the latest version (v4.03) is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65649 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Severity is determined by the number of stools per day or an increase in ostomy output compared with baseline, the need for hospitalization, and the effect on activities of self-care. It is critical to ascertain the patient's baseline bowel pattern when grading the severity of CRD. Although adequate for study purposes, these criteria have been criticized because they do not take into account the volume or the duration of diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other validated CRD measurement scales have been developed but are not in general use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H655800720\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A general approach to evaluation and management of CRD is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64251\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64251 \">algorithm 1</a>), which is based upon several published guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3422348735\"><span class=\"h3\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the patient with CRD begins with a history to determine the severity according to the NCI CTCAE grades (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65649 \">table 1</a>). The volume and duration of diarrhea should also be determined, and the history should include questions concerning foods or drugs that might play a contributory role (which are usually avoided in patients with CRD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57475 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A recent initiation of proton pump inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, antibiotics, or laxatives <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a stool softener (eg, to prevent opioid-induced constipation) can all cause or contribute to diarrhea.</p><p>Because mucosal injury caused by chemotherapy may lead to a temporary lactase deficiency, the ingestion of milk-containing foods may be an important trigger for diarrhea and should be specifically queried. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It should also be appreciated that other factors can contribute to diarrhea in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, and the history should be geared to exploring the possibility of intestinal infection (eg, <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, especially in a patient with prior<em> C. difficile </em>infection), abdominopelvic radiation therapy, prior intestinal resection, malabsorption, intake of excess laxatives or artificial sweeteners, and stool impaction. Patients who have anorexia, abdominal bloating or pain, and frequent soft or loose stool, as opposed to watery diarrhea, may have overflow diarrhea (ie, passage of stool around impacted stool). The presence of fever, dizziness, or abdominal pain should raise concern for a possible complication, such as sepsis or bowel obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H1173989123\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who have an ileostomy are at increased risk for severe diarrhea and dehydration from copious watery ileostomy output. Average output for the ileostomy patient ranges from 500 to 1300 mL a day. Ileostomy effluent contains significant amounts of sodium and potassium. This daily fluid loss places the ileostomy patient at greater risk for dehydration and electrolyte disorders, especially during episodes of increased output. Patients who have an ileostomy are frequently on a baseline regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> to maintain thick ileostomy output and should be carefully queried about loperamide use and oral fluid intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications#H412494750\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine care of patients with an ileostomy or colostomy and management of ostomy complications&quot;, section on 'Ileostomy patients'</a>.)</p><p>A careful physical examination should be performed to assess for signs of volume depletion (eg, reduced skin turgor, hypotension, which may be primarily orthostatic, and low jugular venous pressure) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;</a>) and infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3132968079\"><span class=\"h3\">Investigations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing should address both the complications and causes of CRD. These include a complete blood count and a standard chemistry screen including magnesium. For patients with severe (grade 3 or 4) diarrhea, persistent mild to moderate (grade 1 or 2) diarrhea, or diarrhea accompanied by neutropenia, fever, or blood in the stools, cultures of blood and stool, and diagnostic testing for toxin-producing strains of <em>C. difficile</em> are indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1225714604\" class=\"local\">'Infectious causes'</a> below.)</p><p>Radiographic imaging is not typically needed in most patients with acute CRD. However, for patients who have fever, peritoneal signs, or bloody diarrhea, abdominal imaging (most typically computed tomography [CT]) can be important to identify potential complications, such as bowel perforation, abscess, or neutropenic enterocolitis, or to rule out causes of diarrhea not associated with chemotherapy (eg, bowel ischemia). Surgical consultation may also be needed in these cases. Abdominal radiographs, which can document the extent of stool, are useful in cases of suspected overflow diarrhea.</p><p>Endoscopy is not indicated in the vast majority of cases but should be considered for refractory cases and for patients who develop chronic diarrhea (ie, diarrhea that persists throughout the entire chemotherapy cycle) or bloody diarrhea.

These include small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), fat or bile acid malabsorption, intake of excess quantities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> or lactose intolerance, inflammatory and infectious causes, and stool impaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3855904972\"><span class=\"h3\">Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a cause of fat and carbohydrate malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although difficult to diagnose with certainty, SIBO has been reported in immunosuppressed patients after bowel resection surgery and following pelvic radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. SIBO causes fat malabsorption through bacterial deconjugation of bile acids and carbohydrate malabsorption secondary to luminal degradation of carbohydrates by the gut bacteria. Patients often report abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and foul-smelling, oily, and difficult to flush stools. Deficiencies in lipid-soluble vitamins and in vitamin B12 (consumed by the gut bacteria), as well as elevated folate levels (synthesized by the gut microbiota), are indirect biochemical indices of SIBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The diagnosis of SIBO most often relies on the use of noninvasive carbohydrate breath tests, which have a sensitivity of only approximately 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Among 506 patients with a history of prior cancer treatment including radiation, surgery, or chemotherapy who were evaluated in a gastroenterology clinic at the Royal Marsden Hospital because of chronic loose or watery stool, bile acid malabsorption or bile acid diarrhea was newly diagnosed in over 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients who had pelvic chemoradiation were more likely to have bile acid malabsorption than those who had pelvic radiation alone, possibly due to radiation sensitization of the terminal ileum. Right hemicolectomy was associated with bile acid malabsorption due to resection of the terminal ileum. Bile acid <span class=\"nowrap\">malabsorption/bile</span> acid diarrhea was also frequently associated with pancreatoduodenectomy.</p><p>A referral to gastroenterology should be considered for patients with CRD that persists throughout the chemotherapy cycle (eg, those with chronic loose stool) to evaluate the possibility of bile acid malabsorption.

Both have a rapid onset of action.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Loperamide</a> is a synthetic opioid that binds to mu opiate receptors in the intestinal wall and inhibits peristalsis by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine through activation of the mu opioid receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Inhibition of acetylcholine release also leads to antisecretory activity because muscarinic acetylcholine receptors exist on secretory epithelial cells in the intestinal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. As a result of all of these actions, loperamide reduces fluid and electrolyte loss, decreases fecal volume, and increases stool consistency.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Loperamide</a> is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and extensively metabolized by the liver. The amount of loperamide entering the systemic circulation is minimal (systemic bioavailability is only 0.3 percent), and the blood brain barrier prevents any absorbed loperamide from entering the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

There are no randomized trials directly comparing loperamide with diphenoxylate in patients with CRD. However, efficacy data from double-blind crossover studies comparing these agents in a variety of settings of non-chemotherapy-related acute and chronic diarrhea suggest that loperamide is the more effective agent, providing more rapid control of diarrhea and prolonging the time to first recurrence of diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/40-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-47</a>]; furthermore, it has a more favorable side effect profile, especially lacking central narcotic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-chemotherapy-related-diarrhea/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3955116130\" class=\"local\">'Loperamide and diphenoxylate-atropine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> for any patient with CRD that is refractory to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest initiating therapy at 100 or 150 mcg subcutaneously three times daily (or 50 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/hour</span> intravenously). The octreotide dose should be rapidly escalated to 500 mcg subcutaneously three times a day (rarely up to 2000 mcg three times a day) if lower doses are not effective. (See <a href=\"#H3665408015\" class=\"local\">'Patients refractory to loperamide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have received a fluoropyrimidine and who develop unusually severe diarrhea after the initial dose, in conjunction with severe myelosuppression, mucositis, cardiotoxicity, or neurotoxicity, or after an unintentional overdose, we recommend the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uridine-triacetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">uridine triacetate</a>, initiated within 96 hours of the last chemotherapy dose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Following recovery of unusually severe toxicity after the first dose of a fluoropyrimidine, testing for specific high-risk <span class=\"nowrap\">mutations/polymorphisms</span> in FU-metabolizing enzymes should be undertaken prior to retreatment with a fluoropyrimidine.

We would start intravenous antibiotics for patients with fever, neutropenia, hypotension, peritoneal signs, or bloody diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H665597128\" class=\"local\">'Oral antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For diarrhea that has not resolved after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> and higher dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, we suggest upper endoscopy. Patients without neutropenic enterocolitis (eg, no CT scan evidence of typhlitis and not neutropenic) should undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and <em>C. difficile</em>. Severe ulceration may warrant empiric anti-CMV therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1752923407\" class=\"local\">'Management of refractory patients'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic antidiarrheal treatment is not a standard approach for any chemotherapy regimen, and we recommend against it. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Octreotide</a> long-acting release (LAR) as secondary prophylaxis of CRD should only be considered if diarrhea was the only dose-limiting toxicity and maintaining dose intensity is critical. (See <a href=\"#H524528755\" class=\"local\">'Is there a role for prophylaxis?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who experience CRD should not be retreated with the same chemotherapy regimen until they have not had diarrhea for 48 hours and have not required the use of antidiarrheal agents for 48 hours. The need for dose reduction should be addressed in any patient who develops grade 2 or worse diarrhea, particularly complicated diarrhea, during a prior cycle of therapy.
