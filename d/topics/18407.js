Leukopenia refers to a low total WBC, while granulocytopenia refers to a reduced number of all granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Agranulocytosis literally means the absence of granulocytes, but the term is variably used in the literature to indicate very severe or profound neutropenia (ie, ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100/microL,</span> or sometimes a value that is <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL)</span>. Clinicians focus primarily on the number of neutrophils (predominantly bands and segmented forms) since the risk of infection is most strongly related to the number of circulating neutrophils. Other granulocytes play a minimal role in the defense against bacterial and fungal infections. Thus, neutropenia is the preferred term.

As an example of such a concern, the use of G-CSFs in patients undergoing induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been limited by evidence that malignant myeloblasts express receptors for such growth factors. Prophylactic antibacterial and antifungal agents are more commonly used during chemotherapy for AML rather than CSFs. The potential role of CSFs during induction therapy for AML is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myeloid-leukemia-treatment-and-outcomes-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myeloid leukemia: Treatment and outcomes in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several observational studies report that the use of CSFs during chemotherapy for other malignancies is associated with a small but real increased risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, including AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This issue was addressed in a systematic review of 25 randomized trials of chemotherapy with or without G-CSF for a variety of neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-granulocyte-colony-stimulating-factors-in-adult-patients-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-and-conditions-other-than-acute-leukemia-myelodysplastic-syndrome-and-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Although <span class=\"nowrap\">AML/MDS</span> was reported in significantly more patients treated with G-CSF, all-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients receiving chemotherapy with G-CSF, and greater reductions in mortality were observed in patients who received greater chemotherapy dose intensity. Thus, while the use of myeloid growth factors during chemotherapy increases the risk of a therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, the absolute magnitude of the risk is small, and the risk is probably outweighed by the benefits of using CSFs in this setting. The addition of G-CSF to high intensity, rapidly repeating courses of chemotherapy containing both alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, has been associated with therapy-related myeloid leukemia with a short latency period of two to three years.
