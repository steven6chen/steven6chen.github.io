In one prospective study of 6230 colonoscopies performed for evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, the overall prevalence of SCAD and the prevalence in individuals with diverticulosis were 1.5 and 11 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The prevalence of SCAD is higher in men with a mean age of 64 years at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Mucosal prolapse, fecal stasis, and localized ischemia have all been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is hypothesized that prolapsed mucosa, by being exposed to shear stress, may cause chronic mucosal inflammation. Inflammation may also result from changes in bacterial flora and bacterial enzyme activity due to fecal stasis in diverticulosis, changes in permeability to intraluminal antigens, or altered microcirculation leading to focal mucosal ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1591943155\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD) typically present with chronic diarrhea, cramping abdominal pain primarily in the left lower quadrant, and in some cases intermittent hematochezia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

The diagnosis of SCAD is made by the presence of inflammation on endoscopy and chronic inflammatory changes on biopsy only in an area of the colon with diverticula and absence of inflammation in the rectum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064516761\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On endoscopy, SCAD is characterized by inflammation of the interdiverticular mucosa without involvement of the diverticular orifices. The distribution of inflammation characteristically includes the interdiverticular mucosa of the sigmoid colon and may involve descending colon, but spares the rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The endoscopic features of diverticular colitis can vary in severity and have been classified into four subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A (crescentic fold pattern) &ndash; Characterized by reddish round lesions ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in diameter at the top of the colonic folds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B (mild to moderate ulcerative colitis-like pattern) &ndash; Characterized by loss of the submucosal vascular pattern, edema of the mucosa, hyperemia, and diffuse erosions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type C (Crohn colitis-like pattern) &ndash; Characterized by isolated aphthous ulcers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type D (severe ulcerative colitis-like pattern) &ndash; Characterized by loss of submucosa vascular pattern, intense hyperemia, diffuse ulcerations, and reduced caliber of colonic lumen</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1064516887\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCAD is characterized by the presence of chronic inflammatory changes, the extent of which varies based on subtype.

SCAD can usually be distinguished from most other causes based upon the clinical features, laboratory studies, imaging, and the distribution of colitis on endoscopy and biopsy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis</strong> &ndash; Patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis may present with abdominal pain and a small percentage of patients may have diarrhea. On imaging, patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis have colonic thickening and paracolic fat stranding in the area of the colon with diverticula. However, in contrast to patients with SCAD, the colonic wall thickening is mild and the degree of paracolic fat stranding is more severe than expected for the degree of colonic wall thickening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The inflammatory process may result in accumulation of fluid in the root of the sigmoid mesentery and engorgement of mesenteric vessels. On colonoscopy, acute uncomplicated diverticulitis primarily affects the diverticular orifices and peridiverticular mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. By contrast, in SCAD, the inflammation primarily involves the interdiverticular mucosa with sparing of the peridiverticular mucosa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-diverticulitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute diverticulitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease </strong>&ndash; The clinical presentation of SCAD is indistinguishable from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the distribution of the colitis helps to differentiate it from IBD. SCAD does not involve the distal rectum, whereas the rectum is always involved in ulcerative colitis. Even in cases of ulcerative colitis where the mucosa of the rectum appears normal on endoscopy, there is evidence of chronic inactive colitis on biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/segmental-colitis-associated-with-diverticulosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SCAD can be differentiated from Crohn disease by the finding of Crohn disease elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract (eg, terminal ileum, stomach).

Other drugs that may cause a similar clinical presentation include retinoic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>, and gold. The diagnosis is established by a history of medication use and the presence of nonspecific mucosal inflammation or mucosal erosions on biopsy that resemble ischemic changes.

However, infectious colitis usually has an acute presentation and can be excluded with stool and tissue cultures, stool studies, and on biopsies of the colon.

Mucosal ulceration may be seen on endoscopy similar to SCAD, but solitary rectal ulcer syndrome has a characteristic appearance on histology with a thickened mucosal layer and distortion of crypt architecture. The lamina propria is replaced with smooth muscle and collagen leading to hypertrophy and disorganization of the muscularis mucosa.

Radiation colitis involving the sigmoid colon may have a similar endoscopic appearance to SCAD. However, histologic findings of radiation colitis include eosinophilic infiltrates, epithelial atypia, fibrosis, and capillary telangiectasia.
