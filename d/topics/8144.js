The liver is a big organ in the upper right side of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>). A virus causes this disease. The virus spreads from person to person when their bodily fluids touch. This can happen in a few ways, like having sex or sharing needles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34079315\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hepatitis B?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When people first get hepatitis B (this is called &quot;acute&quot; hepatitis B), they can feel like they have the flu. Some people's eyes or skin turn yellow (called jaundice). These symptoms usually get better, but it can take weeks to months.</p><p>Most people with hepatitis B get better within about 6 months. But 1 out of every 20 adults who gets hepatitis B ends up having the disease for a long time. This is called &quot;chronic&quot; hepatitis B.</p><p>Most people with chronic hepatitis B have no symptoms. But, over time, the infection can lead to a liver condition called cirrhosis. Symptoms of cirrhosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the belly and legs, and fluid build-up in the lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising or bleeding easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion that can come on suddenly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coma</p><p/><p>Chronic hepatitis B also increases the risk of getting liver cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34079322\"><span class=\"h1\">How did I get the disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few ways to catch the hepatitis B virus. All of them involve mixing bodily fluids with other people. You might have caught the disease by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having sex with someone who was infected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharing drug needles with someone who was infected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using infected needles for tattooing, acupuncture, or piercings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharing toothbrushes, razors, or other personal items with someone who was infected</p><p/><p>If your mother had hepatitis when she was pregnant with you, it's also possible you got the infection from her. This is especially likely if she is from a country where hepatitis B is common. In the same way, if you have hepatitis B and are pregnant, you can pass the infection on to your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34079329\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hepatitis B?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have hepatitis B, he or she will do a routine exam to check for other problems. But he or she will probably also order a blood test to check for the virus.</p><p>Your doctor might also want to do tests to see if your liver is damaged. This can involve blood tests or tests to measure the liver's stiffness. Some people might get a liver biopsy. For this test, a doctor puts a needle into your liver and takes out a small sample of tissue. The sample will show how severe the damage is.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1196194373\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hepatitis B treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with acute hepatitis B do not need treatment. The body's infection-fighting system (called the &quot;immune system&quot;) usually gets rid of the virus on its own within about 6 months.</p><p>If you have chronic hepatitis, meaning the virus has not gone away after 6 months, your doctor might suggest taking medicine. However, not everyone with chronic hepatitis B needs treatment right away. If your doctor decides that you do not need to start treatment right away, he or she will monitor you over time. This involves doing regular blood tests. If the tests show that the virus is doing more damage to your liver, or if you start having new symptoms, you might start medicine at that time.</p><p>For people who do need treatment, it usually includes a medicine that fights the virus, called an &quot;antiviral.&quot; There are several types. In severe cases, a person might need a liver transplant, but this is rare. A liver transplant is surgery to replace a diseased liver with a healthy one.</p><p>In addition to getting treatment, your doctor or nurse might recommend getting an ultrasound test every 6 months. (An ultrasound creates pictures of the inside of the body.) This is to make sure you are not developing liver cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34079343\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to protect my liver?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get vaccinated for hepatitis A and other diseases, including the flu and pneumonia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse before taking any over-the-counter pain medicines. (These medicines can sometimes damage the liver.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34079350\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I avoid giving the disease to other people?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have active hepatitis B infection, you can reduce your chances of spreading the virus by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a latex condom during sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telling sex partners that you have the disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not sharing razors, toothbrushes, or anything that might have blood on it</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not sharing needles or syringes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using bandages to cover cuts and open sores</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making sure your family and close friends get tested and get the vaccine for hepatitis B</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleaning drops of your blood off of things with a mixture of bleach and water. For the mixture, use 9 times more water than bleach.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34079357\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have chronic hepatitis B and want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor or nurse first. If you are infected when you give birth, your baby should get a special shot right away. This shot helps protect your baby from infection. You might also need treatment with a medicine for several weeks before giving birth. Plus, your baby will get a vaccine shot at 1 or 2 months old, and another one at 6 months. A test between 9 and 12 months will show if the baby has the disease. Your doctor will decide if he or she needs more vaccine shots at that time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34079364\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with chronic hepatitis B are able to live normal lives. It is still safe to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hug and kiss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Share forks, spoons, and cups</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sneeze and cough around other people</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34079371\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
