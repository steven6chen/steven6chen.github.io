The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of PLB will be discussed here.</p><p>A more general discussion of the approach to the patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma is presented separately, as are discussions concerning the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the most common tumor type found in this setting.

In the pediatric population it represents approximately 3 to 9 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. It is estimated that PLB accounts for 3 to 7 percent of primary bone tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] and 3 to 5 percent of all extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Men are diagnosed more frequently than women, with a male:female ratio ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. More than 90 percent of patients present at age &gt;30 years, with 56 percent of patients &gt;60 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. In a large series, compared with nonosseous DLBCL and secondary bone lymphoma, patients with primary bone DLBCL were younger (median age 56 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. While PLB occurs in children, pediatric PLB is considered a distinct clinical entity and the approach to treatment differs from that of adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients present with bone pain not relieved by rest. A palpable mass due to soft tissue extension of the bony disease is seen in about one-half of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Swelling, pathologic fracture, cord compression and systemic &quot;B&quot; symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, night sweats) may also be present at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Occasionally, symptoms may persist for many months before the patient seeks medical attention.</p><p>The axial skeleton is affected more commonly than the appendicular skeleton (63 versus 37 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The weight-bearing bones are the likeliest sites of pathologic fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additional osseous lesions represent the second most common site of involvement at presentation. On occasion, regional lymph nodes may be involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of cases of PLB are pathologically diagnosed as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54630\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54630 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67828\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67828 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Rarely, indolent lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma may present as PLB. Highly aggressive subtypes, such as Burkitt or lymphoblastic lymphoma are rare. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), typically ALK-1 positive, has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A series of 160 patients with primary bone DLBCL, using an immunohistochemistry-based predictor, reported that 90 percent of cases were of germinal center derivation. <em>MYC</em> rearrangements were identified in 5 of 17 cases and <em>BCL2</em> rearrangement in 6 of 8 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A tissue microarray study of 63 cases of primary DLBCL of bone revealed that 42 were of germinal center derivation and 21 of non-germinal center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on 32 cases reported rearrangements of <em>BCL2</em> and <em>MYC </em>in 9 and 3 specimens, respectively. One case showed both <em>BCL2</em> and <em>MYC</em> rearrangements, and no cases had rearrangement of <em>BCL6</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic diagnosis may be obtained by percutaneous or open biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In the vast majority of cases pathologic examination demonstrates the presence of diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54630\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54630 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67828\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67828 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Biopsy techniques for bone lesions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-tumors-diagnosis-and-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone tumors: Diagnosis and biopsy techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation of a patient suspected of having PLB (eg, lymphoma restricted to a single osseous site) necessitates a comprehensive history and physical examination with emphasis on identifying all involved sites and any evidence of constitutional symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging of the primary site should include plain films as well as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for further characterization of the bone lesion and the extent of soft tissue involvement. Integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> examination of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is required to determine the extent of lymph node involvement as well as the presence of distant disease. While both (99m)Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy and gallium scanning are effective modalities for staging PLB, neither has been used routinely since the advent of FDG PET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain films</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest radiographic sign of skeletal involvement with PLB is diffuse medullary mottling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61322\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61322 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Plain films of the primary site may demonstrate lytic or radiolucent lesions associated with a noncalcified soft tissue mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/11,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24</a>]. Cortical bone erosion and a widened diaphysis may occur as a result of expansive tumor within the bone shaft.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography (CT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT frequently reveals a predominant pattern of osteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. On occasion, an osteosclerotic or mixed pattern may be demonstrated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81794\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81794 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appearance of PLB on MRI is highly variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82588\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82588 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66388\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66388 \">image 3</a>). Soft tissue extension is frequently identified and is typically homogeneously isointense with muscle on T1-weighted images and high on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The majority of patients have abnormal appearing cortical bone. The signal intensity of the bone marrow involvement is heterogeneous in approximately half of cases, compared with the soft-tissue component, and is high or intermediate appearing on T2 weighted images in the majority of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Positron emission tomography (PET)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While bone scintigraphy reflects osteoblastic tumor activity, PET allows characterization of metabolic activity within the tumor as compared with normal tissue. PET has been shown to be accurate in the staging of lymphoma, even in extranodal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>The staging of PLB is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IE represents disease confined to one extranodal site of involvement. For example, PLB limited to a solitary bony lesion is stage IE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If regional lymph nodes are also involved in a patient with a single bone lesion, as is the case in up to one-third of presentations, the disease is stage IIE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/1,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30-32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal disease may be classified as stage IV disease presenting solely in bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a result of the rarity of this disease, randomized trials addressing treatment alternatives for PLB are not available. Most retrospective studies report the results of patients treated with various therapeutic modalities. Historically, PLB was treated with radiotherapy alone with good local control (87 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/12,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,35-37</a>]. However, distant relapse rates were often disappointing, as more than 50 percent of patients failed systemically. Currently multiagent chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is preferred resulting in approximately 70 percent of patients surviving five years.</p><p>An analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database included 1500 adult patients with PLB diagnosed from 1973 through 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Five- and 10-year overall survival rates were 58 and 45 percent, respectively. On multivariate analysis only younger age and localized disease were independent predictors of survival. Five-year survival rates were 87, 74, and 45 percent for those patients diagnosed at &lt;30, 30 to 59, and &gt;60 years, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy with or without radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiagent chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is the preferred treatment of adults with PLB. Given that the majority of PLB are aggressive B cell lymphoma, patients are typically treated with anthracycline-based, multi-agent chemotherapy, such as CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) with the addition of the anti-CD20 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. The use of radiotherapy is controversial, though a number of studies prior to the use of rituximab demonstrate a benefit of combined modality therapy. In patients with unifocal disease, consolidative involved-field radiotherapy is reasonable, but should be individualized with particular attention to the location of disease. Radiation to areas, such as the pelvis, which contain significant marrow production, should be considered carefully. A dose of 30 to 36 Gy is reasonable in patients who attain a complete response following chemotherapy. A higher dose (eg, 40 Gy) is offered to patients with an indeterminant response (eg, those with a positive PET that may represent active tumor or healing bone). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following series illustrate the role of chemotherapy with or without radiation in this patient population:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large series of PLB described 131 patients with a median age of 63 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. One-third of patients presented with disease involving the long bones and another third involving the spine. Eighty percent of patients had aggressive lymphoma and 78 percent presented with advanced disease. Rates of overall survival for the 103 patients with large cell lymphoma at 5 and 10 years were 62 and 41 percent, respectively. Patients over 60 years old and those with high International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores had poorer outcomes. Seventy-nine percent of patients received CHOP or CHOP-like therapy and 21 percent received CHOP plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (R-CHOP). Rates of three-year progression-free survival were 52 percent and 88 percent for those who received CHOP or R-CHOP, respectively. Radiotherapy was administered to patients with cord compression or residual disease following chemotherapy. The rate of 10-year overall survival for those who received radiation was 25 percent compared with 56 percent for those who received chemotherapy only.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective multicenter Rare Cancer Network study described 116 consecutive patients with stage IE (80 percent) or IIE PLB diagnosed between 1987 and 2008, 78 percent of whom were DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients received chemotherapy plus radiation (75 percent), chemotherapy alone (12 percent), or radiation alone (13 percent). Chemotherapy consisted of CHOP or CHOP-like regimens with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> added for 32 patients. With a median follow-up of 41 months, estimated overall survival rates at five and 10 years were 76 and 72 percent, respectively. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with improved five-year survival included IPI score &lt;2 (84 versus 59 percent), radiation dose &gt;40 Gy (95 versus 66 percent), and the administration of at least six cycles of chemotherapy (81 versus 69 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another large series identified 82 patients with PLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Eighty percent had DLBCL and 81 percent had stage I or II disease. Fifty-seven percent received combined modality therapy (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy), 14 percent received radiotherapy only and 30 percent chemotherapy only. At a median follow-up of 67 months, rates of freedom from treatment failure and overall survival were 81 and 88 percent, respectively. In this series, age &lt;40 and combined modality therapy (CMT) were associated with favorable outcome in multivariate analysis. Compared with the series described above, however, these patients had earlier stage disease and only five patients received RCHOP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large series of 160 patients with primary bone diffuse large B-cell lymphoma included 56 percent of patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> disease. Seventy-five percent of patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> containing therapy and 56 percent of patients received radiotherapy. The five-year PFS and OS were 80 and 93 percent respectively. When compared to 499 nonosseous DLBCL, PBL patients were less likely to be elderly, have B-symptoms, and have high IPI scores at presentation. In addition, PFS and OS were superior for PBL patients compared to both germinal center and activated B cell subtypes of DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>Several other series have also demonstrated an improvement in overall survival using combined modality therapy compared with chemotherapy or radiation alone with overall survival of 73 to 100 percent at greater than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/13,34,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,34,40-43</a>]. In the only prospective study in this disease, patients with localized disease that could be encompassed within a radiation field were treated with three cycles of CHOP chemotherapy followed by 45 Gy of involved field radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Thirty-three patients were enrolled; three patients received six cycles of therapy, and six patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. The study closed early due to poor accrual after rituximab became commercially available. With a median follow-up of 4.3 years, the five-year rates of local control and overall survival were 72 and 90 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of surgery is generally limited to diagnostic biopsy and stabilization of a pathologic fracture. Orthopedic management is important during the treatment and recovery period because the potential for fracture persists until there is complete bone healing. Rarely, patients with involvement of the weight-bearing bones may require internal stabilization or bracing until bone healing occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cure of disease remains the ultimate goal of treatment, the focus of pediatric therapy has shifted towards minimizing long-term adverse effects. Three consecutive studies by the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) reflect the trend towards using less intensive therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the early 1980s children treated on research protocols for primary lymphoma of bone received 9 weeks of induction chemotherapy followed by 24 weeks of continuation therapy and subsequent involved field radiotherapy to 37.5 Gy. Local control was 100 percent and, at a median follow-up of nine years, there were no reported treatment complications after attaining remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By the late 1980s the necessity of adding radiation in children with this disease was questioned. A randomized trial testing chemotherapy with or without irradiation confirmed the prediction that radiation was not generally needed in children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, children with primary lymphoma of bone were not included in the study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent to the above study, a retrospective analysis of three consecutive POG studies enrolling 31 children with primary lymphoma of bone demonstrated excellent local control and survival using a CHOP-like chemotherapy regimen without radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>We recommend enrollment of all pediatric patients with primary lymphoma of bone in cooperative group trials. When this approach is not feasible, we recommend utilization of standard multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, such as CHOP. Radiotherapy is reserved for an incomplete response to chemotherapy or local disease progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the completion of planned therapy, patients should be evaluated to determine the response to treatment and should be followed longitudinally for relapse. The response to treatment should be documented by history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, and biochemical profile). When planning the post-treatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of CT scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies.

Acute hematologic side effects may be observed in conjunction with the administration of chemotherapy.</p><p>Second malignancies are extremely rare in adult patients treated with combined modality therapy. However, in one series 2 of 11 pediatric patients treated with adriamycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and concomitant radiotherapy to the whole bone developed bone sarcoma within the radiation portal 5 and 7.5 years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common pattern of failure is the development of distant metastases.

A larger series of 63 patients demonstrated a low rate of local relapse (7 percent) in patients who had a complete response after initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21642404\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the rarity of the primary lymphoma of bone, data regarding prognosis are relatively limited. As described above, multiagent chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy results in five-year survival rates of greater than 70 percent. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy with or without radiation'</a> above.)</p><p>In a single institution retrospective analysis of 53 adults (age range 15 to 89 years, median 57 years) with primary bone diffuse large B cell lymphoma, estimated rates of progression-free survival at three and five years were 61 and 47 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lymphoma-of-bone/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Estimated rates of overall survival at five and 10 years were 81 and 75 percent, respectively. On multivariate analysis, five-year survival rates were worse in patients with multifocal disease (47 versus 92 percent), soft tissue extension (63 versus 96 percent), and higher International Prognostic Index (IPI) score (21, 75, and 94 percent for high, intermediate, and low IPI, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2982957\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of bone (PLB) is a rare lymphoma subtype that presents as solitary or multiple, destructive bone lesions and accounts for less than 2 percent of all lymphomas in adults. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients present with bone pain not relieved by rest. A palpable mass due to soft tissue extension of the bony disease is seen in about one-half of the cases. Swelling, pathologic fracture, cord compression and systemic &quot;B&quot; symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, night sweats) may also be present at the time of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vast majority of cases of PLB are pathologically diagnosed as diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the germinal center subtype. Rarely, clinically indolent lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma may present as PLB. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic diagnosis may be obtained by percutaneous or open biopsy. The evaluation of a patient suspected of having PLB necessitates a comprehensive history and physical examination with emphasis on identifying all involved sites and any evidence of constitutional symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging of the primary site should include plain films as well as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging for further characterization of the bone lesion and the extent of soft tissue involvement. An integrated positron emission tomographic <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> examination of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is required to determine the extent of lymph node involvement as well as the presence of distant disease. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adult patients with PLB, we recommend the use of multiagent chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy rather than radiation therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The role of surgery is generally limited to diagnostic biopsy and stabilization of a pathologic fracture. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All pediatric patients with primary lymphoma of bone should be enrolled in cooperative group trials. When this approach is not feasible, we recommend utilization of standard multi-agent chemotherapy regimens rather than the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy or the use of radiotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Radiotherapy is reserved for an incomplete response to chemotherapy or local disease progression. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should be evaluated after treatment to determine the response to therapy and be followed long-term to monitor for relapse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment related complications.
