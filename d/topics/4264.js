When severe, dementia often surpasses the motor features of PD as a major cause of disability and mortality.</p><p>While PD can coexist with other common causes of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, mild cognitive impairment and dementia are increasingly recognized as a common feature of PD itself. The clinical characteristics and course of cognitive impairment, its pathological features, and the most appropriate treatment are areas of current investigation. Clinical features can generally distinguish between PD and other movement disorders associated with dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies or progressive supranuclear palsy. However, whether PD dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies are distinct disorders, or whether they represent different presentations of the same disease, is an area of debate and investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss cognitive impairment and dementia associated with Parkinson disease.

As an example, in a prospective cohort study of 212 patients with PD, the presence of the &epsilon;4 allele was associated with more rapid cognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In a subsequent study, this haplotype was noted to have a specific association with declining memory, but not the overall rate of cognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic and pathologic basis of Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) is not fully understood and is likely heterogeneous. Historically, the dementia in PD was often attributed to coexisting Alzheimer or vascular pathology. However, neuropathologic studies have found that the degree of Lewy body pathology (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) in the cortex and other areas correlates better with cognitive decline and dementia than does the degree of Alzheimer pathology, which may be relatively modest in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/38-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-44</a>]. </p><p>Lewy bodies constitute the pathologic hallmark of PD, and to some extent there is a relatively predictable neuroanatomic spread of Lewy body pathology in PD that correlates with clinical dementia. Lewy body pathology is initially most prominent in the olfactory system and lower brainstem, then progresses to involve the midbrain structures. In later stages, other brain structures are involved, including the cortex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69456\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69456 \">figure 1</a>). The neuropathologic stage of PD correlates with the severity of both motor parkinsonism and dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, not all patients with PD and dementia have cortical Lewy body pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>The density of cortical Lewy body pathology has also been implicated in the degree of cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/38-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-44</a>]. In one study, Lewy body density in the entorhinal cortex and anterior cingulate accounted for up to one-third of the variability in clinical dementia severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In another study, the severity of Lewy body pathology in the basal forebrain and hippocampus distinguished PD patients with and without dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Important exceptions are noted; some individuals have significant cognitive decline in the absence of cortical Lewy pathology, while others have normal cognitive function in the presence of widespread cortical pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/45,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,48</a>]. A few studies have found that reduced amyloid beta (1 to 42) in the cerebrospinal fluid is associated with cognitive decline in patients with PD, as it is in other patient groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. It is likely that given the substantial prevalence of both AD and PD, that at least some patients with PD will have cognitive decline that is attributable to or exacerbated by AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

In contrast, patients with PD without dementia have rates of brain atrophy similar to controls. MRI studies have found that atrophy in patients with PDD is most prominent in limbic and paralimbic structures, including the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate gyrus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/53,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56</a>]. Another neuroimaging study found that patients with PDD have more white matter hyperintensities in the cholinergic pathways compared with cognitively intact patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Whether the neuropathology of PDD differs from that seen in DLB, or whether both conditions exist on a continuum is not clear; there are few comparative neuropathologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Cortical Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites appear to substantially contribute to the pathologic substrate for dementia in both conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/58,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,60,61</a>].

The latter is a parasomnia characterized by vivid dreams in REM sleep without the usual accompanying muscle atonia. This causes individuals to &quot;act out&quot; their dreams, especially when they are vivid or frightening. RBD is generally accepted to be a predictor for development of an alpha-synucleinopathy such as PD or DLB, often appearing years before the onset of overt neurological or cognitive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Rates of mild cognitive impairment are three to six times higher in PD patients with RBD compared with those without RBD, and RBD is a marker for earlier onset of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/93,98-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,98-100</a>].

In PDD, dementia occurs in the setting of well-established parkinsonism, while in DLB, dementia usually occurs before, at the same time, or very shortly after the development of parkinsonian signs. If parkinsonism is present for more than one year before the onset of dementia, it is officially classified as PDD. This &quot;one year rule&quot; is somewhat arbitrary; the length of time that parkinsonism precedes other symptoms in otherwise similar patients does not correlate with pathologic differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>].</p><p>Other features that may help distinguish between PDD and DLB are a faster clinical decline, earlier onset of hallucinations and delusions, and decreased levodopa responsivity for DLB compared with PDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

Depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in PD and may contribute to cognitive impairment.

Similarly, patients with PD should be screened for causes of delirium that can lead to superimposed cognitive impairment, usually presenting more acutely and with altered sensorium and disrupted attention.</p><p>Patients with AD or other dementias may be treated with neuroleptic drugs associated with extrapyramidal side effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Valproate</a> also has been associated with a syndrome of reversible parkinsonism and cognitive decline (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects#H3580147288\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiseizure drugs: Mechanism of action, pharmacology, and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Valproate'</a>). Because medication effects can be prolonged, even for a year or more, after medication discontinuation, a complete history of medication use should be elicited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a patient with suspected cognitive impairment first establishes the spectrum of cognitive and behavioral changes and provides a measure of its severity. The cornerstone of the evaluation is the clinical interview, which ideally should be supplemented by interview of an informant. The latter can be particularly helpful in determining premorbid level of functioning and pattern of decline, which the patient may not be able to describe accurately.</p><p>There are several basic tests of global cognitive function that can be performed easily at the bedside to screen for cognitive dysfunction and follow changes over time. Of the available tools, we prefer the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which has been found to be an accurate brief bedside test for cognitive impairment in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. The MoCA is accessible online and in several languages at www.mocatest.org. The mini mental state exam (MMSE) cannot be relied upon solely to detect disabling cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) because it is not very sensitive to executive dysfunction, a key feature of PDD. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive impairment'</a> above.)</p><p>Neuropsychologic testing is more sensitive for defining cognitive impairments than global cognitive scales and provides a more detailed assessment of the pattern of cognitive dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. While not required in all patients for diagnostic purposes, formal neuropsychological testing can be particularly useful when there is diagnostic uncertainty after clinical assessment, when it is important to assess for risk of future cognitive decline, or to help identify patients with patterns of cognitive dysfunction that pose risk for future loss of functional independence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Neuropsychological testing'</a>.)</p><p>Treatable causes of cognitive impairment and dementia should be excluded (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Other considerations'</a> above). All medications should be reviewed, particularly those that have been introduced recently. Anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and dopamine agonists are among the more common medications to cause or aggravate cognitive dysfunction in patients with PD. The evaluation also generally includes a neuroimaging study (usually magnetic resonance imaging) and basic laboratory evaluations (eg, vitamin B12 level and thyroid function tests). This topic is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of the frequent comorbidity of depression in PD, screening for depression as an alternative cause or a contributor to cognitive impairment is recommended.

Additional risk factors include the presence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, autonomic dysfunction, and abnormal visual color discrimination. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathologic studies suggest that Lewy body pathology rather than coincident Alzheimer or cerebrovascular disease is responsible for dementia in most patients with PD. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cognitive dysfunction of PD dementia (PDD) is distinct from Alzheimer disease. With PDD, memory impairment is less prominent early on, while executive dysfunction and visual spatial impairments are features that may be apparent and functionally limiting before the patient meets criteria for dementia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive impairment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other disorders that produce dementia and parkinsonism include dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple systems atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration. PDD is distinguished from DLB by the onset of dementia in the setting of well-established parkinsonism of at least one year's duration. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a patient with suspected cognitive impairment first establishes the spectrum of cognitive and behavioral changes and provides a measure of its severity. The cornerstone of the evaluation is the clinical interview, which ideally should be supplemented by interview of an informant. Neuropsychological testing may aid in the diagnosis of dementia; laboratory studies and neuroimaging are performed to exclude other conditions. The mini mental state exam (MMSE) cannot be solely relied upon to detect disabling cognitive impairment in PDD because it is not very sensitive to executive dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) exists on a continuum of severity. Based on the extent to which it interferes with daily activities, it is generally divided into two major categories: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and PDD. Both MCI and dementia are clinical diagnoses in patients with firmly established PD of at least one year&rsquo;s duration that should be suspected in patients with a decline in cognitive abilities that is interfering with daily function (for PDD). (See <a href=\"#H434533250\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These appear to confer a modest benefit for cognition in patients with PDD; evidence for improved neuropsychiatric symptoms is less convincing. Treatment response should be monitored regularly, and therapy should be tapered off if there are no observed benefits or if side effects are intolerable. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Cholinesterase inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual hallucinations and delusions are a frequent manifestation of PD, particularly in advanced stages of the disease, and patients with PDD may be more sensitive to the neuropsychiatric side effects of antiparkinsonian medications. Although stopping all potentially offending antiparkinsonian drugs is usually not an option for patients, dose reduction may be possible, starting with anticholinergic medications. When pharmacotherapy is felt to be necessary based on patient distress or risk of harm to self or others, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> in low doses are preferred over other antipsychotics.

An exception is that dementia is a relative contraindication for deep brain stimulation therapy.
