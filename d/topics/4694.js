Used in both ancient and modern times as a method of execution, cyanide causes death within minutes to hours of exposure. Though significant cyanide poisoning is uncommon, it must be recognized rapidly to ensure prompt administration of life-saving treatment. A summary table to facilitate emergency management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65052 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic review will discuss the toxicity and management of cyanide poisoning. A general approach to the poisoned patient is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System, there were 3165 human exposures to cyanide from 1993 to 2002. Of these, 2.5 percent were fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cyanide poisoning may result from a broad range of exposures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76365 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fire &ndash; In industrialized countries, the most common cause of cyanide poisoning is domestic fires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cyanide can be liberated during the combustion of products containing both carbon and nitrogen. These products include wool, silk, polyurethane <span class=\"nowrap\">(insulation/upholstery),</span> polyacrylonitriles (plastics), melamine resins (household goods), and synthetic rubber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Vehicular fires can also expose victims to cyanide. Toxicologic evaluation of passengers following the explosion in 1985 of a Boeing 737 during take-off in Manchester, England, revealed that 20 percent of the 137 victims who escaped had dangerously elevated levels of carbon monoxide, while 90 percent had dangerously elevated levels of cyanide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Overall, it is reported that significant levels of cyanide are present in up to 35 percent of all fire victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Industrial &ndash; Worldwide industrial consumption of cyanide is estimated to be 1.5 million tons per year, and occupational exposures account for a significant number of cyanide poisonings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Metal extraction in mining, electroplating in jewelry production, photography, plastics and rubber manufacturing, hair removal from hides, and rodent pesticide and fumigants have all been implicated in cyanide poisonings. Skin contact with cyanide salts can result in burns, which allow for enhanced absorption of cyanide through the skin. The combination of cyanide salts and acid, as utilized in electroplating, results in the release of cyanide gas, which can lead to lethal inhalational exposures. Splashes of cyanide solutions can result in dermal as well as mucosal absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical &ndash; Cyanide exposures can result from alternative and standard medical treatments. Amygdalin (trade name Laetrile), a substance derived from apricot and peach kernels, and introduced as an antineoplastic agent in the 1950s, can cause severe cyanide toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The drug is alleged to kill cancer cells selectively via its metabolite, hydrocyanic acid. Laetrile is available as a 500 mg oral tablet that contains 30 to 150 mg of amygdalin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Intestinal beta-d-glucosidase digests the amygdalin, releasing hydrogen cyanide (HCN). This enzymatic reaction explains why only gastrointestinal exposure, in contrast to intravenous administration, results in toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>, a medication used in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies, contains five cyanide groups per molecule. Toxic levels of cyanide may be reached in patients who receive prolonged infusions of sodium nitroprusside, in patients with chronic renal failure, or in pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Treatment for 3 to 10 hours with 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> has resulted in fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Methods for preventing nitroprusside-induced cyanide poisoning include using silver foil on IV tubing (preventing light from decomposing the nitroprusside molecule), using maximal infusion rates of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min,</span> and adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-thiosulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium thiosulfate</a> to the nitroprusside solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet &ndash; The family Rosaceae, which includes the bitter almond, cherry laurel, apricot, plum, peach, pear, and apple, is responsible for many reported cyanide poisonings. These foods all contain cyanogenic glycosides, such as amygdalin, in their pits and seeds. The common (ie, sweet) almond does not cause cyanide intoxication. Other foods containing possible cyanogens include cassava root, bamboo shoots, and soy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &ndash; Miscellaneous exposure to cyanide may occur during illicit synthesis of phencyclidine, terrorist attacks, ingestion of acetonitrile (artificial nail polish remover), product tampering, and cigarette smoking. Because of the natural cyanide found in tobacco, cigarette smokers have more than 2.5 times the mean whole blood cyanide level of nonsmokers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65052 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal cellular metabolism, most adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is generated from oxidative phosphorylation. An important part of this process is the shuttling of electrons through the mitochondrial cytochrome complex (also known as the electron transport chain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78699\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78699 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Cyanide avidly binds to the ferric ion (Fe3+) of cytochrome oxidase a3, inhibiting this final enzyme in the mitochondrial cytochrome complex. When this enzyme's activity is blocked, oxidative phosphorylation ceases. The cell must then switch to anaerobic metabolism of glucose to generate ATP.</p><p>Anaerobic metabolism leads to the formation of lactic acid and the development of metabolic acidosis. Hydrogen ions produced by ATP hydrolysis are no longer consumed in aerobic ATP production, exacerbating this acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Serum bicarbonate decreases as it buffers excess acid, leading to an increased anion gap.</p><p>Despite an ample oxygen supply, cells cannot utilize oxygen because of their poisoned electron transport chain. This functional (or &quot;histotoxic&rdquo;) hypoxia is particularly deleterious to the cardiovascular and central nervous systems (especially the basal ganglia).</p><p>A number of other mechanisms may exacerbate brain injury. Cyanide's nonspecific inhibition of antioxidants (such as catalase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase) results in the accumulation of toxic oxygen free-radicals. Cyanide stimulates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, inducing apoptotic cell death. It also inhibits glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme responsible for the formation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma&ndash;aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glutamic acid. Consequently, cyanide increases the risk of seizures as GABA levels fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Although cyanide has a primary affinity for ferric (Fe3+) iron, a small amount may bind to the ferrous (Fe2+) iron of hemoglobin, forming cyanohemoglobin, which is unable to transport oxygen, thereby further exacerbating tissue hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS AND METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyanide is rapidly absorbed through the respiratory tract and mucous membranes, and it can also be absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Symptoms and signs of poisoning begin at blood cyanide concentrations of approximately 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">&mu;mol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Once absorbed, cyanide is quickly distributed in the body with an estimated volume of distribution of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg</span>. Approximately 60 percent is protein bound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In vivo, cyanide metabolism and neutralization involve a number of mechanisms. The most important is the detoxification of cyanide via rhodanese. Rhodanese is an enzyme found abundantly in many tissues, particularly the liver and muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thiosulfate serves as a sulfur donor in the reaction catalyzed by rhodanese that converts cyanide to thiocyanate, a water soluble molecule excreted in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A minor pathway for cyanide detoxification involves <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxocobalamin-vitamin-b12a-supplement-and-cyanide-antidote-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxocobalamin</a>, the precursor to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>. Circulating hydroxocobalamin combines with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, which is safely excreted in the urine. Finally, a small amount of unmetabolized cyanide is eliminated through urine, sweat, and expiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical features of cyanide poisoning are dependent upon the route, duration, and amount of exposure. Central nervous system and cardiovascular system dysfunction are most prominent. Symptoms and signs can include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system &ndash; Headache, anxiety, confusion, vertigo, coma, seizures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular &ndash; Initial tachycardia and hypertension, then bradycardia and hypotension, atrioventricular block, ventricular dysrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory &ndash; Initial tachypnea then bradypnea, pulmonary edema</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal &ndash; Vomiting, abdominal pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin &ndash; Flushing (cherry-red color), cyanosis (late finding), irritant dermatitis (itching, erythema, edema, vesicles resulting from skin exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal &ndash; Renal failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic &ndash; Hepatic necrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscellaneous &ndash; Rhabdomyolysis, bright red venules seen on funduscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]</p><p/><p>Of note, because of the decreased utilization of oxygen by tissues, the venous oxyhemoglobin concentration will be high, making venous blood appear bright red. Therefore, despite hypotension, apnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia, the patient does not usually appear cyanotic in the setting of cyanide poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Symptoms depend on the severity and route of cyanide poisoning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52242 \">table 3</a>). After inhaling hydrogen cyanide (HCN), the victim may detect a bitter, almond odor (discernible to approximately 60 percent of the population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Initially, inhalation of small amounts of HCN causes headache, anxiety, nausea, and a metallic taste [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, cyanogen chloride (CNCl) exposure predominantly results in eye and mucous membrane irritation and then pulmonary symptoms, namely bronchorrhea, cough, and dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Inhalation of 100 ppm for 30 minutes or 300 ppm for five minutes is usually fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>While toxicity from parenteral exposure begins within seconds, toxicity from ingestion or dermal exposure is delayed from minutes to hours, depending on the extent of exposure. Ingestion of cyanide salts results in gastric irritation, frequently causing vomiting and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The lethal oral dose is 50 mg of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or 200 mg of potassium cyanide (KCN) in an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>]. The lethal dermal exposure is estimated to be 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52242 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed sequelae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survivors of severe cyanide poisoning may develop delayed-onset Parkinsonism or other neurologic sequelae. The basal ganglia are particularly sensitive to cyanide toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Basal ganglia injury may be due to either direct cellular injury or secondary to hypoxic effects. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may demonstrate radiologic changes several weeks after the exposure. Resolution of symptoms is variable, and treatment is supportive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cyanide exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic cyanide exposure results in vague symptoms, such as headache, dysgeusia (abnormal taste), vomiting, chest pain, abdominal pain, and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There are at least three insidious syndromes associated with chronic, low-level cyanide exposure: tobacco amblyopia, tropical ataxic neuropathy, and Leber hereditary neuropathy.</p><p>Tobacco amblyopia occurs predominantly in male cigarette smokers and manifests as progressive visual loss. It may result from an inherent inability to detoxify cyanide, and symptoms may reverse following smoking cessation or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxocobalamin-vitamin-b12a-supplement-and-cyanide-antidote-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxocobalamin</a> (Cyanokit) administration.</p><p>Tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN) is a demyelinating condition associated with excessive cassava consumption, usually in the poor and malnourished. The cassava plant contains a cyanogen, linamarin, which may not be removed with inadequate processing. Signs and symptoms of TAN include paresthesias, ataxia, hearing loss, and optic atrophy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin B12</a> deficiency may contribute to the condition. Cessation of dietary cassava and administration of vitamin B12 ameliorate symptoms.</p><p>Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is a rare, gradual loss of central vision that appears to be due to a defect in cyanide metabolism. A deficiency of rhodanese is one proposed mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87269935\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87269998\"><span class=\"h2\">General testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory evaluation in the potentially poisoned patient should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Point-of-care (eg fingerstick) glucose concentration, to rule out hypoglycemia as the cause of any alteration in mental status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> and salicylate levels, to rule out these common coingestions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram, to rule out conduction system poisoning by drugs that effect the QRS or QTc intervals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy test in women of childbearing age</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87270005\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific testing in cases of potential cyanide poisoning should also include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic chemistries (eg, Na+, Cl-, K+, HCO3-) and arterial blood gas to assess for anion gap metabolic acidosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum lactate concentration to confirm lactic acidosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous blood gas, if possible, to assess venous-arterial PO2 gradient</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin levels (measured by <strong>co-oximetry</strong>), particularly if there is any concern for concomitant carbon monoxide exposure (eg, house or vehicle fire) or exposure to drugs that produce methemoglobinemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65052 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87270012\"><span class=\"h3\">Anion gap acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A severe metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap is expected in cyanide poisoning. In addition to its inhibitory effects on cellular respiration, cyanide can induce cardiovascular collapse and seizures, which exacerbate anion gap metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87270019\"><span class=\"h3\">Lactate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyanide-poisoned patients have an elevated blood lactate concentration. A retrospective study of 11 ICU patients with cyanide poisoning found that plasma lactate concentrations correlated closely with the severity of cyanide toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There were significant inverse correlations between lactate and systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial pH. In fact, lactate concentrations of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/</span> L or greater have been shown to be both sensitive and specific for cyanide poisoning in smoke inhalation victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Consequently, a normal serum lactate should lead the clinician to entertain other diagnoses, while serial lactate measurements can be used to monitor the progress of patients being treated for cyanide poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87270026\"><span class=\"h3\">Venous PO2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A narrowing of the venous-arterial PO2 gradient (ie, venous hyperoxia) may be seen in the cyanide-poisoned patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Cyanide inhibits cellular oxidative phosphorylation resulting in a marked decrease in peripheral tissue oxygen extraction from the blood. This results in elevated central venous oxygenation. On examination, the skin may appear flushed and the venules in the retina bright red. Laboratory evaluation may reveal a decreased arterial&ndash;venous oxygen gradient. Clinicians should keep in mind that a decreased oxygen gradient is nonspecific and can result from other inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and azides.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87270033\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyanide concentration (level)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood cyanide concentrations may be obtained for diagnostic confirmation but results are not available in time to be clinically useful. Even when available, the results of direct testing may be unreliable as both proper storage conditions and prompt blood draws are required. Furthermore, blood cyanide concentrations do not correlate directly with survival. Nonetheless, blood cyanide concentrations of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (12 to 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">&mu;mol/L)</span> generally correlate with tachycardia and flushing, 1 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (23 to 58 <span class=\"nowrap\">&mu;mol/L)</span> with obtundation, 2.5 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (58 to 69 <span class=\"nowrap\">&mu;mol/L)</span> with coma, and greater than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (&gt;69 <span class=\"nowrap\">&mu;mol/L)</span> with death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Cyantesmo test strips are colorimetric strips used in the testing of waste water and during autopsies. One in vitro study assessed the ability of these strips to detect cyanide in simulated samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and found they were accurate only at markedly elevated cyanide levels. Additional work is needed before this test can be considered for routine clinical use.</p><p>Given the limitations of cyanide concentration testing, antidotal treatment should be administered empirically based on the clinical presentation, and blood cyanide levels should serve mainly as confirmation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyanide poisoning is an uncommon entity. Therefore, making the diagnosis requires that the clinician maintain a high index of suspicion based on history and clinical presentation. Patients who are victims of fires or reported ingestions, are exposed at work, or have recently been treated with sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> should all be considered potentially cyanide poisoned. When a clear history is unavailable, clinicians should consider any patient with altered mental status and a metabolic acidosis of unknown etiology a possible victim of cyanide poisoning. Blood cyanide concentrations are not available in time to guide the clinical management of acute poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87269650\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbon monoxide poisoning is similar to cyanide in presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due to cyanide's wide range of possible symptoms and signs, the clinician must consider a number of potential diagnoses, including those listed below.

Although its use has been associated with multiple severe side effects including seizures, anaphylaxis, hypotension, and cardiac dysrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], a systematic review reports that this antidote is efficacious and that adverse effects may be less severe than previously thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Adverse effects appear to be more prominent when evidence of cyanide toxicity is mild or absent.

The formation of methemoglobin entails the oxidation of the ferrous (Fe2+) moiety in hemoglobin to the ferric (Fe3+) form. This provides an attractive alternative binding site for cyanide, in direct competition with the site on the cytochrome complex. When cyanide binds methemoglobin, a relatively less toxic cyanomethemoglobin is formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The induction of methemoglobinemia is accomplished by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amyl-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amyl nitrite</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium nitrite</a>, or dimethylaminophenol. Amyl nitrite ampules are crushed and then inhaled by the patient (either from under the patient's nose or via the endotracheal tube) for 30 seconds of each minute. Thirty second pauses allow for adequate oxygenation during treatment. Amyl nitrite induces only a 5 percent methemoglobinemia, and is thus only a temporizing measure. It may be used when intravenous access is unavailable, such as in the prehospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium nitrite</a> 300 mg (or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> is administered intravenously, inducing a 15 to 20 percent methemoglobinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This level of methemoglobinemia is easily tolerated by most patients. However, methemoglobin shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left further hindering oxygen delivery to tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 2</a>). A decreased dose is required for children weighing less than 25 kg and patients with anemia. A 20 to 30 percent level of methemoglobinemia, the goal of cyanide treatment in the average adult patient, may be lethal in children or anemic patients, who have little reserve. Nitrites should be avoided in pregnant women.</p><p>The appropriate dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium nitrite</a> given to adult patients incapable of tolerating significant methemoglobinemia is adjusted according to the patient's hemoglobin.

Nitrites release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a>, a vasodilator, leading to increased blood flow to the liver and other organs, thereby enhancing the metabolism of cyanide. This proposed effect is supported by the success of other vasodilators in protecting the body from cyanide toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyanide-poisoning/abstract/22,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,54</a>].</p><p>Dimethylaminophenol (4-DMAP), an agent introduced in Germany, is another inducer of methemoglobin. 4-DMAP is given in a dose of 5 mL of a 5 percent solution IV over one minute.

The potency of 4-DMAP, which can require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> to reverse the extent of methemoglobinemia, is problematic.
