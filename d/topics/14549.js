In this rare clinical syndrome, a non-pregnant, non-psychotic woman believes she is pregnant and exhibits signs and symptoms of pregnancy.&nbsp;The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) includes pseudocyesis under Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H977486891\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudocyesis is a rare disorder that affects all ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. It is most common in women aged 20 to 39 years, but has been described in premenarchal and postmenopausal women. In one series of 444 cases dating back to the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, most patients were married and at least 40 percent had given birth previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Although accurate incidence figures are not available, pseudocyesis has been posited to occur more frequently in cultures where childbearing is the central role of women, and fertility (or cultural pressure for giving birth to a child of&nbsp;a specific sex) is a prerequisite for marriage or for a stable relationship. With trends towards smaller family size in developed countries, the incidence of pseudocyesis tends to decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although immigrants may remain at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130911\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of pseudocyesis has both psychological and physiological aspects. Affected women have a belief that they are pregnant and also have one or more of the following signs or symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal enlargement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual irregularities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensation of fetal movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary frequency</p><p/><p>The most common sign, abdominal enlargement, occurs without the typical effacement of the umbilicus observed in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Abdominal protrusion can be due to gaseous distention, excess fat, pronounced lumbar lordosis, or <span class=\"nowrap\">fecal/urinary</span> retention, and often recedes with administration of general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Menstrual changes range from irregular cycles to amenorrhea. The subjective feeling of fetal movements tends to be atypical in pattern, intensity and duration, and may be due to contraction of the abdominal wall musculature or bowel peristalsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Nausea may present early, and may be the initial reason for the patient to suspect pregnancy; vomiting may also occur. There may be weight gain. Breast changes can include engorgement, tenderness, areola and nipple pigmentation, and galactorrhea or nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Pain can be severe, and usually occurs around the time that the woman regards as her expected date of delivery. Some women also experience increased urinary frequency. </p><p>The initial presentation may be for routine prenatal care or for an acute pregnancy related problem (eg, pain, bleeding, labor, decreased fetal activity).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H977486860\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocrinologic changes can occur, but are inconsistent and no single neuroendocrine profile is common to all women with pseudocyesis. Prolactin, estrogen, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone concentrations vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130918\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of pseudocyesis is not well described because of its low prevalence. Knowledge about pseudocyesis is derived from case reports and occasional case series. </p><p>Symptoms generally last from a few weeks to nine months or longer, even years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Recovery may be spontaneous, but is sometimes preceded by &quot;labor&quot; pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women can experience a single, or multiple, episodes of pseudocyesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In the individual patient, prognosis is dependent, to a large extent, on resolution of the specific psychological <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interpersonal factors that have been involved in the development of pseudocyesis in that patient. In some cases, pseudocyesis heralds the development of another psychiatric disorder, most often depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], but sometimes hypomania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] or psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Some women with pseudocyesis eventually commit suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The prognosis of women misdiagnosed as pregnant should also be noted. Several cases of cesarean or near cesarean delivery have been described in women with pseudocyesis who were mistakenly believed to be pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130925\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of pseudocyesis is unclear but appears to involve psychological and neuroendocrine mechanisms that affect each other in a reciprocal interplay between mind and body. There are three major hypotheses about the development of this disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130932\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosomatic hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological factors, such as intense social pressure and anxiety, may alter the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, resulting in signs and symptoms of pregnancy, such as amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Such pressure may include an overwhelming desire to be pregnant for personal reasons, cultural considerations, or both. In these cases, a belief in pregnancy is thought to serve as a defense against confrontation with a difficult reality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], often related to a loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In cultures in which a woman's social value is dependent on her ability to bear children, a woman who does not bear children may be subject to abuse, rejection, divorce, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> economic distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This type of cultural context appears to contribute to risk of pseudocyesis.</p><p>Contributory psychological pressures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of reproductive capability (eg,&nbsp;infertility, sterilization, hysterectomy, menopause), loss of a pregnancy or a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interpersonal pressures (eg, an attempt to maintain&nbsp;a relationship, parity with other women, loneliness, or family pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of conceiving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coping style characterized by somatization and denial, which sometimes occurs in the context of histrionic personality disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive style characterized by using less information before coming to conclusions, to be more certain of conclusions, and less likely to review them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other contributory factors: emotional turmoil, childhood sexual abuse, troubled relationships with significant persons, and naivete about medical matters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/6,7,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,31,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130939\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatopsychic hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Body changes can initiate a false belief in pregnancy in women who tend to misinterpret somatic stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In susceptible women, pseudocyesis has occurred in the context of hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], abdominal neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It also occurs in some women whose antipsychotic medications cause amenorrhea, weight gain, breast soreness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> galactorrhea by increasing prolactin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130946\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychophysiologic hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The psychophysiologic hypothesis is that major depressive disorder or stress, with their concomitant alterations in brain biogenic amines, may be an important initiating event in pseudocyesis, as biogenic amines are involved in the regulation of reproductive hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/14,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130953\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pseudocyesis is made in a non-pregnant, non-psychotic woman who believes she is pregnant and exhibits signs and symptoms of pregnancy. </p><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders includes pseudocyesis under Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>An assessment for psychological contributory factors may confirm the diagnosis of pseudocyesis and identify problems amenable to treatment.&nbsp;The table summarizes aspects of the clinical history relevant to this assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77304 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H990723195\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudocyesis should be distinguished from other conditions with similar presentations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; A positive urine or serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test is diagnostic of pregnancy and highly reliable. False positive and negative tests are rare.

As compared to women with pseudocyesis, these women have a relative absence of physical signs suggestive of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Delusional pregnancy should be suspected in individuals with psychotic disorders. In some cases it is difficult to distinguish a delusional pregnancy (which is a psychotic disorder) from pseudocyesis (which is a somatic symptom disorder), since they may have similar psychological antecedents and may exist on a continuum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For this reason, some authors opine that there should be no distinction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Delusional pregnancies, with no physical signs suggestive of pregnancy, have also been reported in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical conditions</strong> that can produce some of the signs or symptoms of pregnancy. For example, gestational trophoblastic disease (eg, hydatidiform mole) can be associated with all of the signs and symptoms of pregnancy, but a normal fetus and placenta are not present, a persistent corpus luteum cyst can result in a missed period, pituitary tumors can cause amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Abdominal enlargement can be caused by pelvic tumors, Cushing's syndrome, bezoars, bowel obstruction, constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, ascites, organomegaly, aerophagia, and other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some women with pseudocyesis may misinterpret missed menstrual periods related to stress, weight loss, polycystic ovary syndrome, or other factors as a sign of pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Feigned pregnancy</strong> &ndash; This refers to intentional feigning of pregnancy for some specific gain (eg, gaining attention, obtaining leave from work, avoiding punishment, or avoiding responsibility). This is classified as factitious disorder or malingering, the latter when there is a clear external motive, such as financial gain. In a consecutive case series of women with factitious disorder by proxy (women producing or feigning symptoms in their children), 19 percent had pseudocyesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Couvade syndrome</strong> &ndash; Couvade syndrome, also known as &quot;sympathetic pregnancy,&quot; refers to a condition in which someone close to a pregnant woman experiences pregnancy-related physical symptoms, usually towards the end of the pregnancy and during labor and delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130962\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controlled trials of treatments for pseudocyesis have not been performed.&nbsp;However, data from randomized trials have provided an evidence-based approach to treatment of somatoform disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The following treatment recommendations are based on case reports and clinical experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130969\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment goals include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insight into their disorder. However, insight may not be a realistic treatment goal for women who rely heavily on denial and somatization as coping skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disappearance of physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy. Some women with pseudocyesis employ &quot;face-saving&quot; explanations for why they are no longer pregnant once symptoms have remitted. For example, a woman may maintain that she miscarried, that the baby &quot;went to Heaven,&quot; or that witchcraft ended the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].&nbsp;If the patient has shown functional improvement (for example, if she has learned to be more assertive with family members, thereby getting her needs met in ways other than by being pregnant), it is not essential to confront these face-saving solutions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved social and occupational functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced risk of recurrence of pseudocyesis.

In giving up the belief in pregnancy, a patient may be giving up a means of coping with intense emotions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> of solving a difficult dilemma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Having a strong, positive relationship with a clinician can help a woman face this loss, even if the clinical relationship is newly established and short-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Conveying the diagnosis empathically can promote acceptance of the diagnosis and can initiate conversations about underlying issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/29,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,50</a>]. In some cases, this suffices for the symptoms to remit, and follow-up may help prevent recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. By comparison, delivering the diagnosis without empathy can lead to depression, agitation, psychosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &quot;doctor shopping&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>Effective communication of the diagnosis of pseudocyesis includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Informing a patient about objective results (eg, physical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory test negative for pregnancy). Point out to the patient that this situation sometimes happens in susceptible individuals under certain circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conveying that you do not think she is pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conveying that you want to continue to work with her to understand her condition further.</p><p/><p>It is essential to make every effort to avoid an adversarial relationship <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive confrontation. If the patient asserts that she is pregnant after being told she is not, it is important to accept that she is probably not ready to relinquish her belief. Usually the most therapeutic strategy is to refocus attention on arranging a follow-up visit, emphasizing a desire to understand what is happening, and showing interest in the patient's well-being. If the patient returns with repeated or new complaints which she interprets as proof of pregnancy, the clinician should gently repeat the preceding points as often as necessary. </p><p>It can be helpful to state that menstrual irregularity is common and that it is understandable how a patient may misinterpret some of her signs and symptoms as indicating pregnancy. It can also be useful to explain that this condition (pseudocyesis) sometimes happens in susceptible individuals under certain circumstances.</p><p>While there is no need to perform unnecessary laboratory tests, ultrasound examinations can be both diagnostic and therapeutic, if well planned. The propensity of these patients to distort reality interferes with the usefulness of sonography in convincing them that they are not pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients with pseudocyesis can misinterpret ambiguous ultrasound images and believe they see fetal parts. It can be helpful for a clinician to be present during the procedure to elicit the patient's observations and reactions directly, to address misperceptions, and to discuss pregnancy-linked fears and fantasies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13130983\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with pseudocyesis rarely agree to formal psychotherapy. More often, a patient will agree to continue to see an <span class=\"nowrap\">obstetrician/gynecologist</span> or midwife, and will accept informal counseling in that context. In such cases, the perinatal care provider can consult with a mental health provider for guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>Counseling for pseudocyesis is generally brief and episode-focused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/29,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,47</a>]. Patients rarely agree to continue therapy once the acute symptoms and stressors have resolved, even if they are at risk for symptom recurrence or have not yet acquired more versatile coping skills.</p><p>The process of counseling for pseudocyesis can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish and maintain an alliance with the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify internal and external factors that may be contributing to the patient's belief that she is pregnant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77304 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focus the content of sessions on specific, modifiable internal factors, not on the purported pregnancy.

Switching to agents that do not cause these side effects can alleviate pseudocyesis for some patients.

In some cases, however, ongoing amenorrhea fosters an ongoing belief in pregnancy. Hormonal intervention to induce a withdrawal bleed can promote the patient's ability to relinquish a false belief in pregnancy. If hormonal intervention is done, we suggest prescribing hormonal therapy to accompany rather than precede psychological intervention so vaginal bleeding is not interpreted as a miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>For women who are not hypoestrogenic, a progestin withdrawal test (ie, administration of medroxyprogesterone 10 mg daily for five days) will cause withdrawal bleeding. For women with marked hypoestrogenism and amenorrhea, estrogen may be needed to prime the endometrium before adding a progestational agent to cause withdrawal bleeding (eg, conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> 2 mg daily for 21 days with 10 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> daily for the last 10 days).

Successful treatment often requires involving significant family members and friends, both to reduce pressures toward pseudocyesis and to help treat pseudocyesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudocyesis/abstract/14,32,50,52,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,32,50,52,58</a>].&nbsp;The table lists examples of how family and friends can be involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70027 \">table 3</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H13130904\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal enlargement and other signs and symptoms associated with pregnancy are common in women with pseudocyesis. (See <a href=\"#H13130911\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms generally last from a few weeks to nine months or longer. Recurrences may occur. Prognosis is dependent, to a large extent, on resolution of the specific psychological <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interpersonal factors that have been involved in the development of pseudocyesis in the patient. (See <a href=\"#H13130918\" class=\"local\">'Natural history and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three major hypotheses about the development of pseudocyesis are the psychosomatic, somatopsychic and psychophysiologic hypotheses. Contributory factors can include psychological pressures, social pressures, and misinterpretations of bodily changes. (See <a href=\"#H13130925\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of pseudocyesis is made in a non-pregnant, non-psychotic woman who believes she is pregnant and exhibits signs and symptoms of pregnancy. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders includes pseudocyesis under Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder &#160; (See <a href=\"#H13130953\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differential diagnosis includes pregnancy, delusional pregnancy, feigned pregnancy, couvade syndrome, and medical disorders that can produce some of the signs or symptoms of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H990723195\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment goals include disappearance of physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy, improved social and occupational functioning, and reduced risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H13130969\" class=\"local\">'Goals of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective communication of the diagnosis of pseudocyesis includes informing a patient about objective results, conveying that you do not think she is pregnant, and conveying that you want to continue to work with her to understand her condition further. It is essential to avoid an adversarial relationship <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive confrontation if the patient is not ready to believe that she is not pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H13130976\" class=\"local\">'Conveying the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intervention involves conveying the diagnosis empathically, conducting brief supportive counseling with the patient, and advising medical personnel and significant others about helpful ways to support the patient in relinquishing her false belief and refocusing on adaptive goals. Hormonal restoration of menses is sometimes helpful, as is psychopharmacologic treatment of co-morbid psychiatric disorders. (See <a href=\"#H999035837\" class=\"local\">'Intervening with health care providers and health care systems'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13132246\" class=\"local\">'Psychotropic medication'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13132277\" class=\"local\">'Restoring menstrual periods'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13132330\" class=\"local\">'Involving family and friends'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">American Psychiatric Association.
