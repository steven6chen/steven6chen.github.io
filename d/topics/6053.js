Clinicians in other parts of the world should also be aware of these infections in view of increasing travel and migration. </p><p>Infestations of the hepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree occur most commonly with <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em>, <em>Clonorchis sinensis</em>, <em>Opisthorchis felineus</em>, and <em>Fasciola hepatica</em>. Other hepatobiliary parasites include <em>Opisthorchis viverrini</em>, <em>Fasciola gigantica</em>, and <em>Dicrocoelium dendriticum</em>. </p><p>Helminthic infestation affects the liver and the biliary tract either during transit of worms or because these organs serve as natural habitats. Worms in the bile ducts may produce features of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis or acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], liver cysts and abscesses may occur due to ascariasis or liver flukes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and hepatic <em>Echinococcal</em> cysts can rupture into the biliary tract, producing cholangitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has now become the main diagnostic and therapeutic tool in these patients.</p><p>This topic will review the endoscopic diagnosis and management of biliary parasitosis. Detailed discussions of the various parasites and a discussion of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis can be found elsewhere.

The following disease associations were observed in a series from Kashmir, India of 500 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease due to <em>Ascaris</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary colic &ndash; 56 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cholangitis &ndash; 24 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cholecystitis &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute pancreatitis &ndash; 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic abscess &ndash; &lt;1 percent</p><p/><p>In another study from Kashmir, India, ascariasis was reported as the cause of acute pancreatitis in 60 percent of children presenting with acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, ascariasis has also been reported as the cause of post-cholecystectomy syndrome (ie, persistence of symptoms following cholecystectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Identification of parasite DNA in biliary stones has suggested that <em>C. sinensis</em> and <em>A. lumbricoides</em> may also be related to biliary stone formation. </p><p>The diagnosis of ascariasis should be suspected in patients from an endemic area who have biliary symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In these settings, identification of the egg or the adult worm from bile or feces is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis. Features of ascariasis can be identified with ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). On EUS, the worms appear as long, linear hyperechoic structures without acoustic shadowing (&quot;single-tube sign&quot;) or with a central hypoechoic tube (&quot;double-tube sign&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F116464\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116464 \">image 1</a>). With the availability of non-invasive imaging modalities (eg, EUS and MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is mainly performed in this setting for therapeutic intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two ultrasound findings are strongly suggestive of biliary ascariasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long, linear, parallel echogenic structures without acoustic shadowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Four lines sign&quot; &ndash; Non-shadowing echogenic strips with a central anechoic tube representing the parasite's digestive tract, indicative of the worm and its intestines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p>MR cholangiogram may show intraductal worms as a linear low intensity filling defect in the bile ducts. The &quot;three-line&quot; sign appears to be a characteristic sign of biliary ascariasis on 3T magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ERCP is a highly sensitive method to demonstrate the worm in the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Worms can be seen in the duodenum and very often across the ampulla of Vater during endoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58130\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58130 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Cholangiographic findings of the <em>Ascaris</em> worm during ERCP include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long, smooth, linear filling defects with tapering ends (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68876\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68876 \">image 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parallel, smooth filling defects, curves, and loops crossing the hepatic ducts transversely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilation of bile ducts (usually the common bile duct)</p><p/><p>With the availability of choledochoscopes (eg, the SpyGlass direct visualization system), the worm can also be visualized directly within the bile duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64053\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64053 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholangioscopy and pancreatoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The extraction of the worm is easiest if it is protruding out of the papilla where a grasping forceps can be used to hold it, while both worm and endoscope are withdrawn from the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58130\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58130 \">picture 1</a>). Worms that are entirely within the bile duct can sometimes be stimulated to migrate out of the papilla after contrast injection, or they can be extracted by using a basket or occlusion balloon. As an alternative, the worm can be grasped gently within a Dormia basket, pulled into the duodenum, and then removed with a grasping forceps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The worm should be extracted completely since remnants can lead to stone formation.</p><p>A polypectomy snare should <strong>not</strong> be used since it tends to cut the worm. The use of endoscopic sphincterotomy for the removal of worms is debatable. It has been postulated that the widened opening facilitates further entry of worms into the biliary tree. One study including more than 300 patients suggested that pancreatobiliary ascariasis was more common in patients with prior cholecystectomy or sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A second case report seemed to confirm these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, in another study, a wide sphincterotomy was required for worm removal in 73 of 77 patients (95 percent) with pancreaticobiliary ascariasis. There were no major complications reported during or following the procedure, and recurrence after sphincterotomy did not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similarly, a third study did not report any recurrence of biliary ascariasis in patients after a papillotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Other small studies have, however, disputed the use of a sphincterotomy during ERCP for removal of worms. We have used papillary balloon dilation to facilitate extraction in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-balloon-dilatation-for-removal-of-bile-duct-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic balloon dilatation for removal of bile duct stones&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Extraction of the worm is usually associated with rapid relief of symptoms and is successful in more than 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/10,11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,15</a>]. However, infection may be associated with calculi or strictures, which can usually be dealt with endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients should be treated with anti-helminthic therapy to eradicate remaining worms. A single oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> (400 mg) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mebendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mebendazole</a> (500 mg) is usually successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascariasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascariasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthelminthic-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anthelminthic therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ECHINOCOCCUS GRANULOSUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive hosts for <em>E. granulosus</em> are canines (dogs, wolves, and foxes) in which the adult worm resides in the intestines (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-control-of-echinococcosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and control of echinococcosis&quot;</a>). The parasite forms a hydatid cyst in humans and other species, who serve as intermediate hosts. The most common site of cystic hydatid disease is the liver.</p><p>The most patients are infected as children and are asymptomatic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-echinococcosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of echinococcosis&quot;</a>). However, in approximately one-fourth of the cases, hepatic hydatid cyst ruptures into the biliary tree (because of higher pressure in the cyst, often up to 80 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), producing obstructive jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a series of 16 patients, one study found biliary rupture of the cyst in eight patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Less commonly, cysts can rupture into the peritoneal cavity or other organs, potentially leading to anaphylaxis and multiorgan failure.</p><p>There are two types of communications with the biliary tree: frank intrabiliary rupture and simple communication. Patients with simple communications may be asymptomatic, with the communications identified only during surgery. By contrast, patients with frank intrabiliary ruptures are usually symptomatic. The contents of the cyst (the scolices and daughter cysts) drain into the biliary ducts and cause intermittent or complete obstruction of bile duct, resulting in obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, and sometimes cholangitic abscesses.</p><p>Most of these patients present with jaundice, which can be progressive or fluctuating. The only physical sign may be tender hepatomegaly. Intrabiliary rupture should be suspected when an ultrasound reveals a cystic space occupying lesion in the liver and a dilated common bile duct in a patient from an endemic area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is usually established by radiologic tests and serology (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-echinococcosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of echinococcosis&quot;</a>). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is indicated when the results of these tests are uncertain, and in patients who have recurrent biliary colic, especially if associated with icterus or cholangitis (see below). One study reported that biliary complications of hydatid cysts were detected by ERCP in 60 percent of cases compared with 25 percent by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound.</p><p>Cholangiography often reveals minor communications, particularly with peripheral ducts, which are of unclear clinical significance. 99mTc&ndash;labeled albumin aggregate injection into cysts can assist in the detection of leakage into the systemic circulation. However, the utility of a radionuclide scan may be limited by availability and the potential for a rare allergic reaction. Duodenoscopy sometimes shows whitish, glistening membranes lying in the duodenum, or impacted in the papilla of Vater (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75827\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75827 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Three patterns of intraductal filling defects on ERCP have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Filiform, linear, wavy material in the common bile duct due to laminated hydatid membranes or ill-defined, irregular leaf-like filling defects due to fragmented membranes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Round or oval lucent filling defects, floating in the common bile duct due to daughter cysts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brown, thick, amorphous debris</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of hydatid disease usually involves anti-helminthic therapy combined with either surgical resection of the cyst or percutaneous aspiration and instillation of scolicidal agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-echinococcosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of echinococcosis&quot;</a>). </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albendazole</a> is highly effective and should be started prior to endoscopic or surgical therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthelminthic-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anthelminthic therapies&quot;</a>). </p><p>Endoscopic therapy should be reserved for patients with suspected biliary complications occurring before or after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sphincterotomy is often needed in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholangitis. The cysts and membranes can then be removed with the help of a basket or an occlusion balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Saline irrigation of the bile duct may be necessary to flush out the hydatid sand and small daughter cysts. Life-threatening episodes of acute cholangitis can be managed by initially placing a nasobiliary drain (NBD), followed by extraction of hydatid cysts and membranes with or without sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The drained bile (through NBD) can be examined for hydatid hooklets or membranes.</p><p>Sterilization of the remaining daughter cysts and germinal layers is required to complete treatment. This has usually been accomplished during surgery when the cyst is completely removed after instillation of a cysticidal agent (such as hypertonic saline, iodophor, or ethanol), which is left to dwell in the cyst cavity for 30 minutes prior to excision. It can also be achieved endoscopically if a catheter can be passed into the communicating cyst, permitting irrigation of the main cyst with hypertonic saline (30 percent). However, the safety and efficacy of this approach has not been well studied. It should not be attempted in settings in which the cysts communicate with other parts of the biliary tree or branches. There have been only a handful of case reports of successful nonsurgical treatment of complicated hydatid disease with ERCP and medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-operative ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications can also develop following surgery for hydatid disease. Early complications include the development of jaundice (which is often due to echinococcal remnants) or an external biliary fistula, occurring in up to 2 percent of patients typically within two to four weeks of surgery. Endoscopic biliary stenting for approximately four to six weeks is usually sufficient to achieve fistula closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Sphincterotomy may also be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Late complications, including sphincter of Oddi stenosis and sclerosing cholangitis, are most commonly seen in patients in whom formalin was used to sterilize the cysts during surgery; minor or major communications with the bile duct permit the formalin to enter the biliary system, causing inflammatory changes. Most of these complications can be treated with ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>]. Patients who develop sphincter of Oddi stenosis can be treated with sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A biliary endoprosthesis or balloon dilation may be required in patients who develop a bile duct stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Endoscopic treatment methods have also been successful in addressing other complications of biliary hydatidosis such as clearing the biliary tree, closing fistulas and biliary leaks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLONORCHIS SINENSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. sinensis</em>, also known as the Chinese liver fluke, is a trematode commonly found in East Asia, mainly in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-flukes-clonorchis-opisthorchis-and-metorchis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver flukes: Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, and Metorchis&quot;</a>). It lives in the biliary tract of humans and other fish-eating animals, where it can cause obstructive jaundice. Infection is acquired from eating raw freshwater fish (carp and salmon group). Complications include intrahepatic stones, recurrent bile duct stones, cholangitis, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, and cholangiocarcinoma. <em>O. felineus</em> and <em>O. viverrini</em> are closely related, have similar life cycles and pathophysiology, and produce similar clinical manifestations. The geographic distribution of these parasites varies. While <em>O. viverrini</em> is endemic in Laos and Thailand, <em>O. felineus</em> is endemic in Eastern Europe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis of biliary injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metacercariae (the infective stage) attach to the common bile duct, migrate along the epithelial lining of the duct, and stay in the intrahepatic ducts, where they mature into adult worms, which are flat, elongated, and 10 to 23 mm in length. As a general rule, they seek the smaller branches of the left lobe of liver, attain maturity in approximately one month, and begin to pass eggs. The migration of the immature worm causes trauma to the bile duct epithelium, leading to ulceration and desquamation. Adenomatous hyperplasia and goblet cell metaplasia may develop as a result of epithelial injury, which can lead to fibrous tissue formation, resulting in extensive thickening of the bile duct (referred to as encapsulating fibrosis of the duct).</p><p>Single exposure to the parasite is of little clinical significance. However, repeated exposures may provoke a diffuse involvement of the biliary tree, including the large bile ducts and gallbladder. The average infection involves 20 to 200 adult worms; in heavy infections 20,000 flukes may be present in the liver. Dilated subcapsular bile ducts, adenomatous hyperplasia of the bile duct epithelium with or without periductal fibrosis, and an eosinophilic infiltration may be seen in early infections. Cirrhosis may develop in late infection and in patients with repeated infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of infected patients are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients usually present with cholangitis, intrahepatic calculi, or cholangiohepatitis. Chronic infection is also associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and classification of cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanical effect of the worm blocks bile flow, predisposing to cholangitis, which causes death of the worm. Paroxysms of colicky upper abdominal pain due to cholangitis may be confused with calculous biliary disease. However, calculous disease may coexist since the eggs can act as a nidus for stone formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristics on cholangiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many cholangiographic findings have been described (depending upon the stage of infection), including elongated filling defects (from a few millimeters to 10 mm in length) and intrahepatic biliary dilation, which is predominantly peripheral. The defects are of variable size and shape and occur mostly within the smaller tertiary or quaternary intrahepatic bile ducts. Findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mulberry-like appearance: multiple saccular or cystic dilations of the intrahepatic bile ducts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An arrowhead sign: rapid tapering of the intrahepatic bile ducts to the periphery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in the number of intrahepatic radicles due to portal and periportal fibrosis</p><p/><p>Duct wall irregularities are due to adenomatous hyperplasia, and vary from small indentations to hemispherical filling defects. When these indentations or defects occur in series, they can give rise to a scalloped appearance. The individual <em>Clonorchis</em> worms may be visible as filamentous, wavy, and elliptical-shaped filling defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Flukes within the bile ducts may be difficult to visualize on ultrasound. On CT, they appear as nonshadowing echogenic <span class=\"nowrap\">foci/casts</span> within bile ducts. Flukes within the gallbladder move in reaction to a light blow above the gallbladder with the transducer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urgent biliary decompression is required for patients with acute cholangitis.

Human infection usually occurs after eating raw vegetables that are contaminated with metacercariae (the infective form). Humans are an accidental final host in the life cycle of the parasite.

Other hepatobiliary parasites include <em>O. viverrini</em>, <em>F.</em> <em>gigantica</em>, and <em>Dicrocoelium dendriticum</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>A. lumbricoides</em> organisms normally reside in the jejunum but are actively motile and can invade the papilla, thus migrating into the bile duct and causing biliary obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a highly sensitive method to demonstrate the worm in the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Worms can be seen in the duodenum and very often across the ampulla of Vater during endoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58130\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58130 \">picture 1</a>). Extraction of the worm is usually associated with rapid relief of symptoms and is successful in more than 80 percent of patients. Patients should be treated with anti-helminthic therapy to eradicate remaining worms. A single oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> (400 mg) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mebendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mebendazole</a> (500 mg) is usually successful. Whether or not a sphincterotomy should be carried out for removal of the worms in the bile duct is still debatable. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Ascaris lumbricoides'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive hosts for <em>E. granulosus</em> are canines (dogs, wolves, and foxes). In humans, who serve as intermediate hosts, the parasite forms a hydatid cyst. The most common site of cystic hydatid disease is the liver. The diagnosis is usually established by radiologic tests and serology. ERCP is indicated when the results of these tests are uncertain and in patients who have recurrent biliary colic, especially if associated with icterus or cholangitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment of hydatid disease usually involves anti-helminthic therapy combined with either surgical resection of the cyst or percutaneous aspiration and instillation of scolicidal agents. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albendazole</a> is highly effective and should be started prior to endoscopic or surgical therapy. Endoscopic therapy should be reserved for patients with suspected biliary complications occurring before or after surgery. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Echinococcus granulosus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>C. sinensis</em> lives in the biliary tract of humans and other fish-eating animals, where it can cause obstructive jaundice. Infection is acquired from eating raw freshwater fish (carp and salmon group). Complications include intrahepatic stones, recurrent bile duct stones, cholangitis, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, and cholangiocarcinoma. Many types of cholangiographic findings have been described (depending upon the stage of infection), including elongated filling defects (from a few millimeters to 10 mm in length) and intrahepatic biliary dilation, which is predominantly peripheral. The defects are of variable size and shape and occur mostly within the smaller tertiary or quaternary intrahepatic bile ducts. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Urgent biliary decompression is required for patients with acute cholangitis. Aspirated bile may show adult worms and ova. Endoscopic biopsies are indicated when cholangiocarcinoma is suspected. Surgical intervention may be required in patients who have developed abscesses, extensive fibrosis, or biliary lithiasis. The drug of choice is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">praziquantel</a> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in three divided doses for one day).
