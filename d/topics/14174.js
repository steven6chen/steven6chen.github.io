It changes the ability of the lens in the eye to focus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76735\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76735 \">figure 1</a>). People who have presbyopia have trouble focusing on things that are up close. They often have to hold things at arm's length to see them well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10437437\"><span class=\"h1\">What are refractive errors?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Refractive errors are a group of disorders that impair vision because the cornea (a structure in the front of the eye) cannot focus light or images onto the back of the eye the right way. Refractive errors can occur at any age. The most common refractive errors are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myopia (&quot;near-sightedness&quot;) &ndash; People who are near-sighted can see clearly up close, but things at a distance look blurry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperopia (&quot;far-sightedness&quot;) &ndash; People who are far-sighted can see clearly far away, but things up close look blurry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Astigmatism &ndash; People with astigmatism see things as blurry at any distance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10437444\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for presbyopia and refractive errors?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can check how well you see by having you read a standard eye chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50810 \">figure 2</a>). Depending on how you do reading the chart, he or she might also suggest that you see an eye doctor for a &quot;comprehensive eye exam.&quot; During a comprehensive eye exam, the doctor can look for different causes of vision loss. That's important, because people can have more than one thing wrong with their eyes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10437451\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your vision is blurry or you have trouble seeing things up close or far away, you should see a doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10437458\"><span class=\"h1\">How are presbyopia and refractive errors treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presbyopia and refractive errors can usually be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses. In some cases, people do well with glasses sold at the drug store without a prescription. Keep in mind that the needs of your eyes can change as you get older. You might need to change prescriptions every so often.</p><p>Some people with refractive errors can have a form of surgery that is done with a laser, called &quot;LASIK.&quot; During this surgery, the doctor uses the laser to reshape the cornea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10437540\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-vision-loss-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related vision loss (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
