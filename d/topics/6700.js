In premenopausal women, the most common cause of androgen excess is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In contrast, when hyperandrogenism develops de novo or progresses in postmenopausal women, it is usually associated with other causes, such as ovarian hyperthecosis or an androgen-secreting tumor.</p><p>The etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of postmenopausal hyperandrogenism are reviewed here.

Some of the processes responsible for hirsutism or virilization may have been present from a younger age, while others more often develop de novo in postmenopausal women. The differential diagnosis of clinical hyperandrogenism for women presenting at any age is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83495\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83495 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4144902\"><span class=\"h3\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the evaluation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify the most serious causes of hirsutism, including androgen-secreting tumors (ovarian or adrenal) and ovarian hyperthecosis. Androgen-secreting tumors are rare, but they may be malignant at the time of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H253052001\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian and adrenal neoplasms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ovarian hyperthecosis, a disorder characterized by severe hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, is seen primarily in postmenopausal women but occasionally in premenopausal women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-hyperthecosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian hyperthecosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine if the patient is taking any drugs that could cause excessive hair growth (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a>, androgenic steroids).

In contrast, women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) develop hirsutism in their premenopausal years, and the pattern of hair growth tends to be stable in many women. If it worsens, changes occur over years, not weeks or months (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyperandrogenism'</a>). Hirsutism remains stable or improves after menopause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A detailed history is essential for determining the presence of a more chronic condition such as PCOS or nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH). A drug history should exclude anabolic steroid use or exposure to exogenous androgens (eg, transfer from a partner's testosterone gel) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hirsutism and alopecia are the most common symptoms of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women. Signs of virilization include deepening of the voice, increased muscle mass, and clitoromegaly. Clitoral enlargement is typically determined on the basis of clitoral length or the clitoral index (length x width): length &gt;10 mm or an index &gt;35 mm<sup>2</sup> is considered abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Virilization is only seen with more severe hyperandrogenemia (serum testosterone concentration &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span>. Although serum testosterone levels may be elevated in postmenopausal women with a history of PCOS, they are not in a range that can cause virilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyperandrogenism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hyperandrogenism in certain ethnic groups may have more subtle clinical manifestations. The evaluation of body hair must consider the individual's ethnic background. Most Asian and Native American women have little body hair, while Mediterranean women, on average, have substantially greater quantities of body hair, even though serum androgen concentrations are similar in the three groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism caused by a tumor also experience uterine bleeding due to peripheral aromatization of androgens to estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253052605\"><span class=\"h3\">Biochemical testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best test to evaluate postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism, particular those with severe hyperandrogenism, is a total testosterone concentration. This is best assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">(LC-MS/MS),</span> an accurate and specific method. The immunoassays that are available in most hospital laboratories are not suitable to accurately measure testosterone in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Free testosterone measured by equilibrium dialysis is more sensitive but must be performed in a specialty laboratory. Free testosterone by analog method (&quot;direct&quot;) is not accurate and should not be ordered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Biochemical testing'</a>.)</p><p>We also suggest measuring serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), an adrenal androgen, to try to identify an adrenal source of excess androgens (most importantly, adrenal androgen-secreting neoplasms). However, mildly elevated levels of DHEAS are unlikely to affect management, and elevated DHEAS concentrations do not discriminate as well as serum testosterone between malignant and benign causes of adrenal hyperandrogenism. In addition, it is unclear whether DHEAS is the best marker for androgen-secreting carcinomas. However, we do measure it in women who present with signs and symptoms suggestive of an androgen-secreting tumor. Serum DHEAS values above 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (18.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> require further evaluation.<strong> </strong>In patients with hyperandrogenism in whom testosterone and DHEAS levels are not elevated, measurement of ketosteroids (KS) in a 24-hour urine collection may provide evidence of an adrenal tumor that does not make DHEAS or testosterone, although this is rare. If an androgen-secreting tumor is not suspected, measurement of DHEAS or 17-KS is not necessary.</p><p>Other routine testing for women presenting with hyperandrogenism includes serum prolactin (hyperprolactinemia is thought to be an extremely rare cause of hirsutism or alopecia) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to evaluate for NCCAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (although this almost always presents in the reproductive years). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other laboratory testing depends upon the presence of signs or symptoms of other endocrinopathies (eg, biochemical testing for Cushing's syndrome or acromegaly should be done if other features of these conditions are present). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Available tests'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-acromegaly#H135819880\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of acromegaly&quot;, section on 'Serum IGF-1 concentration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253047899\"><span class=\"h2\">Women without virilization or severe hyperandrogenemia</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H326229689\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional evaluation depends on the clinical scenario. Women without virilization or severe hyperandrogenemia (eg, serum total testosterone &lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> most likely have benign causes of hyperandrogenism such as PCOS, NCCAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, hyperandrogenism due to medications, or other uncommon endocrine disorders such as Cushing's syndrome or acromegaly. PCOS and NCCAH almost always present initially in adolescence or early adulthood rather than menopause, but women may experience persistent signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism after menopause. (See <a href=\"#H253051502\" class=\"local\">'PCOS'</a> below and <a href=\"#H253051564\" class=\"local\">'Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, additional evaluation is not needed for a patient with known PCOS, with the possible exception of a metabolic evaluation (see <a href=\"#H253051502\" class=\"local\">'PCOS'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Further evaluation after diagnosis'</a>). As noted, almost all women with NCCAH will have been diagnosed earlier in life with an elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration. (See <a href=\"#H253051564\" class=\"local\">'Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with possible Cushing's syndrome or acromegaly on initial biochemical testing should undergo the standard additional evaluation for these disorders.

Androgen levels normally fall in both PCOS and healthy women after menopause; however, postmenopausal women with a history of PCOS continue to have higher androgen levels than healthy postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>One study found that postmenopausal women diagnosed with PCOS had average testosterone, androstenedione, and DHEAS levels of 47 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (1.63 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> 205 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> and 143 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (3.88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> respectively, while postmenopausal women who were healthy before menopause had average testosterone, androstenedione, and DHEAS levels of 37 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (1.28 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> 107 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (3.74 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> and 60.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (1.63 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The decrease in androgen levels in PCOS women after menopause has not been associated with decreased clinical signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Therefore, worsening hirsutism or new signs of hyperandrogenism should prompt evaluation for other causes in women with PCOS, as they do in women without this history.

A strong association between elevated androstenedione levels and risk for endometrial cancer that was independent of body mass index (BMI) and estrogen levels was demonstrated in two large studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253053108\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe hyperandrogenism</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253049361\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For ovarian neoplasms and hyperthecosis, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is the procedure of choice if the patient is a good surgical candidate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/31,54,64,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,54,64,71</a>].

TVUS may help to determine whether an endometrial biopsy is indicated (cancer is very unlikely if the endometrial thickness is &lt;4 mm). If an endometrial biopsy does not suggest hyperplasia or cancer, a hysterectomy may not be necessary, although experts may disagree.</p><p>Androgen-secreting adrenal tumors should be removed. Although there have been case reports of gonadotropin-responsive adrenal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], which therefore may respond to treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, this is very rare. Furthermore, given the generally poor response of such tumors to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/12,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,34</a>], they are not likely to respond to glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253049368\"><span class=\"h4\">GnRH agonist therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient is not a good surgical candidate or the patient does not want surgery, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists have been shown to be an effective alternative treatment for some cases of hyperandrogenism of ovarian origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/8,30,39,54,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30,39,54,72,73</a>]. Dosing of GnRH agonists depends on the agonist used. One group achieved long-term (ie, at least 3.5 years after the last dose of GnRH agonist) suppression of testosterone (elevated by a presumed testosterone-secreting ovarian tumor) using 7.5 mg of depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> once monthly for three months, a dose that they then decreased to 3.75 mg per month for another year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another group achieved long-term suppression of testosterone levels by administering this latter dose for five months and then administering two doses of 11.25 mg every three months, for a total of 11 months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-postmenopausal-hyperandrogenism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Since no histologic diagnosis is available as final confirmation in women treated with GnRH agonists rather than surgery, we suggest careful follow-up, including periodic testing of androgen levels and ovarian imaging. If serum testosterone concentrations do not decrease after several months of GnRH agonist therapy, we suggest reconsidering surgery for histologic diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253055987\"><span class=\"h3\">Women without severe hyperandrogenism</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PCOS </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The management of postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism that is not severe, ie, hirsutism, acne, or scalp hair loss, most often due to PCOS, is similar to that for premenopausal women. However, estrogen-progestin contraceptives, the first-choice therapy for premenopausal women, are not suggested for hormonal suppression in postmenopausal women.

Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> has not been studied for hirsutism in this population, it is ineffective in premenopausal women, and we therefore do not suggest its use.

Hirsutism and alopecia are the most common symptoms of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women, while signs of virilization (clitoromegaly, lowering of the voice, and increased muscle mass) are only seen with higher androgen levels (eg, serum testosterone concentration &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span>.

Although somewhat less useful, we also suggest measuring serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), an adrenal androgen, to try to identify an adrenal source of excess androgens (most importantly, adrenal androgen-secreting neoplasms). Urinary 17-ketosteroids (17-KS) may occasionally be helpful if testosterone and DHEAS are not elevated; elevation would suggest adrenal carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H253052605\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other laboratory tests include serum prolactin, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and biochemical testing for Cushing's syndrome or acromegaly if features of these conditions are present.
