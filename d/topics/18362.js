Identification of the ureter at each step in a procedure avoids injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The highest risk of denervation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> devascularization is during ureterolysis; therefore, removal of all tissue surrounding the ureter should be avoided during gynecologic surgery performed for benign indications.</p><p>During oophorectomy or hysterectomy, the steps of the procedure in which the ureter is most likely to be injured are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligation of the ovarian vessels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligation of the uterine vessels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Closure of the angles of the vagina cuff</p><p/><p>The most common site of ureteral injury is the distal ureter at the level of the uterine arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/6,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Ligation of the ovarian vessels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid ureteral injury when the ovarian vessels are ligated during oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), there are several methods of identifying the ureter: opening the retroperitoneum to visualize the ureter directly, visualizing the ureter through the peritoneum, and palpating the ureter. There are no high quality data regarding which method is associated with a lower risk of ureteral injury. However, opening the retroperitoneum and visualizing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palpating the ureter prior to isolating, clamping, and ligating the ovarian vessels is the method that best ensures accurate identification and protection of the ureter.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opening the retroperitoneum abdominally &ndash; The following sequential steps are performed when opening the retroperitoneum abdominally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76515\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76515 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ligate and divide the round ligament to create an opening in the broad ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/25,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Palpate the external iliac artery. Continue using blunt dissection to open the broad ligament lateral to the external iliac artery and lateral and parallel to the ovarian vessels (which are within the infundibulopelvic ligament). Limit use of energy sources in close proximity to the ureter. As noted above, the expected thermal spread from devices ranges from 2 to 22 mm (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of injury'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Expose the external iliac artery and vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dissect out the ureter from the surrounding tissue as it crosses over the vessels and is adherent to the medial leaf of the broad ligament. Visualization of peristalsis confirms that the ureter has been identified. Take care to avoid disrupting the vascular supply of the ureter, which may result in ischemia and necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visualization or palpation &ndash; When visualization through the peritoneum or palpation, rather than opening the retroperitoneum, is used to identify the ureter, it may be mistaken for other structures. During laparoscopy, visualization of the ureter is reasonable when the peritoneum is translucent and the ureter can be clearly seen. When this method is used, visualization of peristalsis confirms identification of the ureter. In contrast, palpation of the ureter is often misleading, since many structures can have the same consistency as the ureter. In circumstances in which the ureter cannot be visualized (eg, bleeding in operative field), however, we use palpation to attempt to identify the ureter. The ureter has a &quot;rubber-band&quot;-like consistency and should snap when pulled gently; the ureter does not pulsate when palpated.</p><p/><p>During a laparoscopic approach to oophorectomy, it is our practice to visualize the ureter and its peristalsis along the pelvic sidewall. Once the location of the ureter is confirmed, we make a small incision in the peritoneum superior to the ureter but inferior to the ovarian vessels, parallel to both of these structures. This peritoneal incision serves as a visual marker (the ureter is below it). We then make a second incision more superiorly along the pelvic sidewall, above the ovarian vessels, and use these two peritoneal incisions to isolate and ligate our ovarian vessels.</p><p>Of note, during a vaginal approach to oophorectomy, the ureter is more difficult to visualize and is protected by clamping the ovarian vessels as close as possible to the ovary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Ligation of the uterine arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the level of the uterine arteries, the uterine vessels are skeletonized before ligation to visualize the ureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76698 \">figure 2</a>). If the vessels have been isolated, it is not required to completely dissect out the ureter. When placing a clamp prior to ligating the vessels, care must be taken that only the vessels are included in the clamp. Perhaps more importantly, mobilizing the bladder from the anterior cervix and displacing it inferiorly will also shift the ureters inferior to the uterine arteries prior to clamping.</p><p>The ureters pass below the uterine vessels, and once these vessels are ligated, the ureter will pass just inferior and lateral to this pedicle. Thus, to protect the ureter during subsequent dissection of the cardinal ligament, the clamp is placed medial to the uterine artery pedicle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal cuff closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ureters enter the bladder posteriorly, along its interface with the anterior vaginal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64999\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64999 \">figure 3</a>). Thus, care must be taken during closure of the vaginal cuff to avoid both the ureters and bladder. As the bladder is dissected off the surface of the vagina or cervix and displaced inferiorly, the ureters will descend with the bladder to a level safely below the superior aspect of the cuff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoiding bladder injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury to the bladder may occur while dissecting the bladder away from the lower uterus, cervix, and upper vagina during hysterectomy. This tissue plane is usually easy to find and dissect, whether a hysterectomy is being performed from a laparoscopic, abdominal, or vaginal approach. However, one or more previous cesarean deliveries may cause fibrosis and scarring. In this setting, there is increased difficulty in dissecting the tissue plane with a higher risk of bladder injury.</p><p>We use sharp dissection, with or without electrosurgery, whether the dissection is easy or difficult. Blunt dissection may result in increased bleeding or tearing of the bladder. Bladder injury that occurs with sharp, rather than blunt, dissection can often be easier to repair. </p><p>In laparoscopic surgery, injury to the bladder usually occurs during secondary trocar insertion. Bladder injury can be avoided by placement of the secondary trocar under direct visualization and by making certain that the bladder is emptied before trocar placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery#H860573828\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Bladder puncture'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H903420224\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At abdominal hysterectomy, having the first assistant constantly pulling the uterus up, while the surgeon mobilizes the bladder and ligates the uterine arteries and the <span class=\"nowrap\">cardinal/uterosacral</span> ligaments, facilitates descent of the bladder and ureters away from these structures, decreasing the risk of injury. During laparoscopic hysterectomy, having the second assistant constantly pushing the uterus up accomplishes the same maneuver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying a pelvic kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pelvic kidney, which occurs in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 3000 individuals, may be encountered during gynecologic surgery. They are usually unilateral, retroperitoneal, irregular in shape, and may occur anywhere below the pelvic brim. The blood supply is invariably anomalous, often with branches coming from the aorta, common, external or internal iliac vessels, and vessels may come from both sides of the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, with increased access to high-quality preoperative imaging, intraoperative discovery of a pelvic kidney should be a rare occurrence.</p><p>Identification of an unsuspected pelvic kidney reduces the risk of damage to the kidney or its blood supply. During surgery, the presence of a retroperitoneal mass or anomalous ureteral anatomy suggests the presence of a pelvic kidney. During laparotomy, identification of a pelvic kidney can be made by palpating the abdominal retroperitoneum to confirm that there is no abdominal kidney, and then by identifying the ureter which exits the pelvic kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Intraoperative sonography may also be used to identify a pelvic kidney. In general, biopsy is avoided if a mass is suspected to be a pelvic kidney as biopsy can lead to bleeding and organ injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract injury during female pelvic surgery occurs in approximately 0.3 to 1 percent, and may be as high as 2.4 percent of procedures. Injury rates vary by procedure type and anatomic location (bladder or ureter). Cystoscopy detects more urinary tract injuries compared with visual inspection alone, particularly for ureteral injuries.

(See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract injury may occur through direct contact with a surgical instrument, a suture or a stapling device, or as a result of devascularization or denervation. Potential consequences of lower urinary tract injury include ureteral obstruction (resulting obstructive nephropathy), genitourinary fistula, or urinoma. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women undergoing gynecologic surgery, we recommend not using prophylactic ureteral catheters (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest use of prophylactic ureteral catheters for women with severe endometriosis, large cervical fibroids, or a history of pelvic irradiation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic ureteral catheters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important principle for prevention of urinary tract injury is to develop and divide tissue planes to identify and isolate the structures of the lower urinary tract before operating on other pelvic structures.

We suggest not using palpation as the sole method of identifying the ureter (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), although palpation alone may be required when the ureter cannot be visualized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During hysterectomy, the most common site of ureteral injury is the distal ureter at the level of the uterine arteries. Other steps of the procedure associated with injury to the ureter are ligation of the ovarian vessels (during concomitant oophorectomy) and vaginal cuff closure. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Surgical technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During hysterectomy, constant upward tension (for open hysterectomy) or elevation (for laparoscopic hysterectomy) of the uterus causes inferior displacement of the ureters and decreases risk of urinary tract injury when ligating the uterine arteries, cardinal, and uterosacral ligament complexes. Additional techniques include skeletonizing the uterine vessels prior to clamping and dissecting the bladder off the underlying vaginal surface prior to closing the vaginal cuff.
