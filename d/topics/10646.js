The exact incidence is unknown. Mastocytosis affects males and females in equal ratios, although there is a slight male predominance in childhood and a slight female predominance in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, 80 percent of mastocytosis cases appear during the first year of life, and the majority is limited to the skin. Most eventually improve or resolve completely by adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults who develop mastocytosis more often have systemic forms of the disease, and these disorders tend to persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cutaneous forms of the disease account for less than 5 percent of adult cases.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of all forms of mastocytosis results from both chronic and episodic mast cell-mediator release and excessive mast cell accumulation in one or more tissues. Mast cells contain a variety of vasoactive mediators and normally function to protect the body from microbial invaders and other insults by releasing these chemicals to generate inflammatory responses. Mediators released from mast cells include histamine, heparin, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor, proteases, and cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52832 \">table 1</a>). The signs and symptoms associated with sudden and extensive mast cell-mediator release are similar to those associated with allergic and anaphylactic reactions. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to mediator release, some advanced forms of mastocytosis involve signs and symptoms arising from tissue infiltration by mast cells, effects of local accumulations of these cells, and the presence of an associated hematologic neoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The molecular pathogenesis of mastocytosis is incompletely understood. Stem cell factor (SCF), also called kit ligand, is a growth factor that is essential for normal development and expansion of mast cells from hematopoietic progenitors. Mast cells express a receptor for SCF on their surface, the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (CD117). Many of the molecular defects associated with mastocytosis involve gain-of-function mutations in <em>KIT</em>, the gene encoding KIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. There are limited data that SCF overexpression may play a role in some cases.</p><p>Most other hematopoietic cells express KIT early in their development and then lose it during maturation, becoming unresponsive to SCF. Only mast cells maintain KIT and remain responsive to SCF throughout the lifetime of the cell. Thus, abnormalities in SCF regulation or KIT preferentially affect the growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and activation of mast cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mutations in KIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activating and nonactivating mutations of <em>KIT</em> have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-12</a>]. However, no consistent correlation between the type of mutation and either phenotype or prognosis has been recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater than 95 percent of adults with systemic mastocytosis (SM) have exon 17 <em>KIT</em> mutations, most commonly D816V. D816V <em>KIT</em> mutations are also common in skin lesions of adults with systemic disease, although data are more limited. One study of 59 adults with mastocytosis in the skin that developed in adulthood found that 58 had D816V <em>KIT</em> mutations in bone marrow cells, although only 74 percent had the mutation demonstrable in lesional skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, available data suggest that approximately 40 percent of children with cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) have exon 17 mutations, with another 40 percent carrying <em>KIT</em> mutations outside of exon 17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>].</p><p/><p>The precise mechanism by which <em>KIT</em>-activating mutations enhance signaling is not fully characterized, but these defects lead to SCF-independent activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Clonal expansion and apoptotic defects of <em>KIT</em>-mutated mast cells are thought to provide the basis for pathologic accumulation of mast cells in tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The most common mutation detected in human mast cell disease occurs in the codon 816 and consists of the substitution of valine for aspartate (Asp816Val). Asp816Val is present in most patients with SM and in some patients with different forms of CM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/13,15,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,19-23</a>]. This mutation results in a putative-activating loop in the kinase domain. In transfection studies, it causes ligand-independent autophosphorylation of KIT and induces constitutive activation of the Stat5-PI3K-Akt signaling cascade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Cutaneous or systemic forms of mastocytosis may present this way.</p><p/><p>The remaining presentations are ways in which different forms of systemic mastocytosis (SM) can present in adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An adult with recurrent episodes that resemble allergic reactions or anaphylaxis</strong> &ndash; Symptoms typically include flushing, syncope or near-syncope, hypotension, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Urticaria and angioedema are not usually present. Evaluation does not reveal a causative allergy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An adult with anaphylaxis after Hymenoptera sting</strong> &ndash; Symptoms typically include flushing, syncope or near-syncope, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension. Urticaria and angioedema are not usually present. Evaluation can reveal specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to bee, wasp, or other Hymenoptera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Fifty percent of the patients will not have cutaneous mastocytosis (CM).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An adult with hematologic abnormalities, splenomegaly, fatigue, and weight loss prompting a hematologic evaluation</strong> &ndash; Cytopenias, such as anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia may develop in systemic forms of mastocytosis due to infiltration of the bone marrow by mast cells and interference with normal hematopoiesis. In contrast, patients with myeloproliferative variants of systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) more typically present with leukocytosis or thrombocytosis. Hepatomegaly due to infiltration with either mast cells or cells of the associated hematologic malignancy may also develop.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An adult with sclerotic or lytic bone lesions on imaging studies, prompting an evaluation for metastatic malignancy</strong> &ndash; Bone marrow biopsy then reveals mast cell infiltrates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An adult with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of colitis and unexplained splenomegaly, in whom hematologic evaluation has revealed mastocytosis</strong> &ndash; Gastrointestinal biopsies from such patients typically show dense infiltrates of CD117 positive mast cells that also express CD25.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An adult with a diagnosed hematologic disorder, in whom the molecular evaluation showed a </strong><strong><em>KIT</em></strong><strong> mutation</strong> &ndash; Such patients have usually been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The diagnosis of SM was not made earlier because either no bone marrow histology was available, the necessary stains to reveal mast cells were not performed, or the other hematologic neoplasm overwhelmed the mast cell infiltrate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An adult with osteoporosis and pathologic bone fractures, particularly if risk factors for osteoporosis are lacking</strong> &ndash; Occasionally mastocytosis will present in this manner in a young adult, particularly a male, in whom an evaluation for unusual causes of osteoporosis is undertaken.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-mast-cell-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Mast cell disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mastocytosis comprises a group of rare disorders of excessive mast cell proliferation and accumulation, which can be limited to the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis [CM]) or involve bone marrow and other extracutaneous tissues (systemic mastocytosis [SM]). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children are usually affected by cutaneous forms of mastocytosis. Most improve or resolve completely by adolescence. In contrast, adults more often present with systemic forms of mastocytosis and have persistent disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mast cell development is dependent upon stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor, KIT. Activating mutations of <em>KIT</em> (the gene for the KIT protein) are strongly associated with both cutaneous and systemic forms of mastocytosis and thus have been implicated as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of mastocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CM is characterized by accumulations of mast cells in the skin and can take various forms. CM is further divided into three major subtypes: maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM) (including urticaria pigmentosa), diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM), and solitary mastocytoma of the skin. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous mastocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SM is divided into four distinct disorders: indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN), aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Systemic mastocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The many signs and symptoms of mastocytosis may be categorized into skin findings, symptoms due to release of mast cell mediators, and symptoms arising from mast cell infiltration of organs other than the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52832 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91167\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91167 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With cutaneous involvement, flushing and pruritus are the predominant symptoms. The most common skin finding is UP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63025 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105069\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105069 \">picture 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F97908\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97908 \">picture 14</a>), which can be present in patients with either cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis. Other specific skin findings include solitary or multiple cutaneous mastocytomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50284\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50284 \">picture 8</a>), DCM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68182\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68182 \">picture 5</a>), and telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59118\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59118 \">picture 12</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Skin findings and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with both CM and SM, a variety of triggers can precipitate mast cell-mediator release (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70309\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70309 \">table 4</a>). Release of mediators may occur in explosive episodes, presenting as apparent allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, or on a chronic basis, giving rise to problems, such as chronic gastrointestinal complaints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91167\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91167 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms arising from mediator release'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracutaneous organ involvement is only present in systemic forms of mastocytosis. Depending on the organs involved, findings include steatorrhea, malabsorption, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hematologic and liver abnormalities, and skeletal lesions. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings arising from organ infiltration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mastocytosis may develop different combinations of the signs and symptoms described above, although there are several characteristic clinical presentations.
