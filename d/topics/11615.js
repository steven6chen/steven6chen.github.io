Disorders in glucose availability or utilization can result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.</p><p>The causes and management of neonatal hyperglycemia are reviewed here. Neonatal hypoglycemia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87482346\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of hyperglycemia is uncertain. It is often defined as blood glucose &gt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or plasma glucose &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. However, these levels are frequently observed during glucose infusions in newborns, especially in extremely preterm infants, and may not require intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most neonatologists become concerned about hyperglycemia when plasma glucose concentration (the standard laboratory test) exceeds 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. However, higher levels of hyperglycemia are required to produce the hyperosmolality and osmotic diuresis that may be clinically important. Plasma osmolality increases by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L</span> for each 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> increase in plasma glucose concentration. Thus, a rise in glucose concentration from 110 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.1 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> only increases osmolality by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L,</span> which is a relatively small change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucosuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose excretion in the urine in hyperglycemic neonates is determined by the degree of hyperglycemia and renal tubular reabsorptive capacity for glucose. Newborns have variable reabsorptive capacities for glucose, which may be particularly reduced in those who are ill or preterm.</p><p>The net effect is that glucosuria alone is not a good marker for hyperglycemia since it can occur at normal blood glucose concentrations. In one study of sick preterm infants born at 25 to 33 weeks gestation, for example, fractional glucose excretion varied widely and glucosuria was often seen at normal blood glucose concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These variations presumably are related to immaturity of the proximal tubule.</p><p>On the other hand, mild hyperglycemia may be associated with little or no glucosuria in infants with mature proximal tubules. This was illustrated in a study of newborns who were given glucose infusions; at a mean blood glucose concentration of 197 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> there was little glucosuria and no significant osmotic diuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperglycemia typically occurs when a newborn cannot adapt to parenteral glucose infusion by decreasing endogenous glucose production or increasing peripheral glucose uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is usually related to an associated clinical condition such as extreme prematurity or sepsis.</p><p>In both term and preterm infants, the following observations of glucose metabolism are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic glucose production is suppressed by infusion of glucose (with or without amino acids), hyperglycemia, and insulin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucose production is not changed by intravenous (IV) lipid infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulating insulin concentrations increase appropriately with hyperglycemia and increase hepatic and peripheral glucose uptake.</p><p/><p>However, hyperglycemia is more common in preterm infants compared with term infants. Although the mechanism(s) for the increased risk of hyperglycemia in preterm infants is uncertain, the following may be contributory factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor insulin response &ndash; Insulin responses may be inappropriate in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. In one study, 23 of 56 ELBW infants became hyperglycemic during IV glucose infusions that were incrementally increased to a maximum rate of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute between days two and six of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Baseline insulin levels were similar in hyperglycemic and euglycemic infants, but only 15 of 23 hyperglycemic infants had a normal insulin response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The inappropriate insulin response in hyperglycemic ELBW infants may be related to defective islet beta cell processing of proinsulin. In a study comparing 15 hyperglycemic to 12 normoglycemic ELBW infants during the first week of life, proinsulin levels were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic ELBW infants, who also needed higher insulin levels to reach euglycemia compared with normoglycemic infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete suppression of glucose production &ndash; Suppression of hepatic glucose production in response to glucose infusion also varies in very immature infants and may be incomplete. In a series of 10 infants born at 25 to 30 weeks gestation, glucose production rates decreased from 4.3 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute as glucose infusion was increased from 1.7 to 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin also increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Proteolysis due to negative nitrogen balance, which occurs more commonly in the preterm infant, may also be a stimulus for inappropriate glucose production. For example, in ELBW infants, insufficient protein intake results in endogenous protein loss (proteolysis) in an effort to meet the basal metabolic needs of the infant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased secretion of counterregulatory hormones associated with stress &ndash; Secretion of epinephrine and cortisol in stressed infants may contribute to hyperglycemia. The role of stress was demonstrated in a report of metabolic responses to glucose infusion in preterm infants (weight 700 to 1550 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Measurements were made before and after infusion in controls and in infants who required assisted ventilation and were considered stressed. Stressed infants had higher levels of glucose and of cortisol compared with controls and were more likely to have hyperglycemia (13 of 18 versus 1 of 12 infants). This difference was not due to decreased insulin or increased cortisol levels, because, among the stressed infants, insulin levels were higher and cortisol levels lower in the hyperglycemic compared with the euglycemic newborns. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Counterregulatory hormones'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, neonatal hyperglycemia is associated with a clinical condition, rather than a specific disorder of glucose metabolism, and occurs in infants receiving intravenous (IV; parenteral) glucose infusions. A rare cause of hyperglycemia is neonatal diabetes mellitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16460511\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenteral administration of glucose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral glucose is administered to most preterm or ill neonates because adequate enteral feeding is delayed. Neonatal hyperglycemia often occurs in this setting because glucose metabolism and needs change, requiring readjustment of glucose infusion rates. In neonates receiving parenteral administration of glucose, sepsis, prematurity, and stress are all factors that affect glucose metabolism and increase the risk of hyperglycemia.</p><p>Immediately after birth, glucose is typically provided at a rate of 5 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute to avoid hypoglycemia. In most settings, sufficient glucose at a rate of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute is provided by the administration of 10 percent dextrose solution at 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day. Although dextrose is a hydrated form of glucose and is 91 percent glucose, the correction usually is not applied in clinical practice. The glucose infusion rate is increased to approximately 11 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute in the first two to three days after birth to provide calories for growth. In general, glucose infusion rates &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute are avoided, as this exceeds the ability of most infants to oxidize glucose and may promote excessive lipogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in premature infants&quot;, section on 'Glucose'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperglycemia during glucose infusion is common in preterm infants, especially very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g). In a prospective study of continuous glucose monitoring of 188 VLBW infants during the first week of life, 80 percent of patients had glucose levels greater than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (144 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> and one-third had glucose levels greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> for more than 10 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Risk factors associated with hyperglycemia included increasing prematurity, small for gestational age, use of inotropic agents, lipid infusions, and sepsis. Other studies also demonstrate an increased risk of hyperglycemia with decreasing gestational age (GA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) frequently develop hyperglycemia in the absence of high rates of glucose infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Proposed underlying mechanisms include reduced insulin secretion, incomplete suppression of hepatic glucose production, and stress response resulting in counter hormone regulation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperglycemia may be a presenting sign of sepsis in an infant with previously normal blood glucose concentrations and no change in glucose infusion rate. Potential mechanisms include the stress response, decreased insulin release, and reduced peripheral utilization of glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the VLBW preterm infant, fungal rather than bacterial sepsis appears to be more commonly associated with hyperglycemia. This was illustrated in a study of preterm infants with BWs less than 1250 g that reported 21 of the 45 infants with fungal infection developed hyperglycemia compared with 11 of 46 infants with late-onset sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87482725\"><span class=\"h3\">Stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stress response to critical illness with the release of counter regulatory hormones (eg, epinephrine and cortisol) may result in hyperglycemia, especially in preterm infants who require mechanical ventilation. There is limited evidence that increased severity of respiratory distress and metabolic acidosis requiring medical intervention (eg, administration of bicarbonate) is linked to an increased risk of hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The stress response also may be responsible for hyperglycemia occurring after surgery. In this setting, increased rates of fluid administration containing dextrose may also be a contributory factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperglycemia is a common complication of glucocorticoid therapy, especially in ELBW infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Hyperglycemia can also occur following administration of methylxanthines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> (the mechanism may be suppression of insulin release or insulin insensitivity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal diabetes is a rare cause of hyperglycemia, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 500,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is defined as persistent hyperglycemia occurring in the first months of life that lasts more than two weeks and requires insulin for management. The majority of infants are small for gestational age (SGA), which may be related to decreased insulin secretion in the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They present with weight loss, volume depletion, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria with or without ketonuria and ketoacidosis.</p><p>Neonatal diabetes is caused by mutations in a number of genes that encode proteins that play a critical role in the normal function of the pancreatic beta cells such as proteins that are subunits in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The course of neonatal diabetes is variable depending on the affected gene. Genetic mutations of the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel can result in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus, whereas mutations of the SUR1 subunit can result in either permanent or transient neonatal disease. In a series of 57 infants presenting before one month of age with hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy for more than two weeks, the disorder was transient in 18, transient with recurrence between 7 and 20 years of age in 13, and permanent in 26 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Transient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 6 or an unbalanced duplication of paternal chromosome 6 is present in the majority of cases of transient neonatal diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. Mutations of the imprinting gene <em><span class=\"nowrap\">ZAC/PLAGL1</em>,</span> a transcriptional regulator of the type 1 receptor for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (an important regulator of insulin secretion), at chromosome 6q24 have been shown to be the major cause of neonatal transient diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>].</p><p>Activating mutations of the <em>ABCC8</em> gene that encodes SUR1, the type 1 subunit of the sulfonylurea receptor, can cause either transient or permanent neonatal diabetes, as discussed in the next section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Permanent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About one-half of patients with neonatal diabetes mellitus have a permanent form that is primarily due to gene mutations related to the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. In rare cases, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is due to pancreatic agenesis or hypoplasia. In one case series of four patients with developmental failure of the pancreas, who were products of a consanguineous kinship, a specific gene defect was not identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Most patients with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have mutations that affect the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel), which regulates the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Activating mutations increase the number of open KATP channels at the plasma membrane, hyperpolarizing the beta cells, and preventing the release of insulin.</p><p>In contrast, inactivating mutations, described in children with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, reduce the number of open KATP channels, resulting in depolarization of the beta cells and persistent hypersecretion of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The KATP channel is composed of a small subunit Kir6.2 that surrounds a central pore and four regulatory SUR1 subunits. Activating gene mutations that affect these subunits can prevent insulin release, resulting in hyperglycemia. Oral sulfonylurea is efficacious for patients with neonatal diabetes dues to mutations that affect the KATP channel and can be safely used before genetic testing results are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>KCNJ11</em> gene encoding Kir6.2 &ndash; The most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes is due to activating mutations in the <em>KCNJ11</em> gene, which encodes Kir6.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. The diagnosis is made within the first two months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Infants are SGA, but exhibit postnatal catch-up growth with insulin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Affected patients can also have neurologic abnormalities including severe developmental delay, epilepsy, muscle weakness, and dysmorphic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These findings are also known as the DEND syndrome (developmental delay, epilepsy, neonatal diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subcutaneous insulin was routinely used in the past to treat patients with this disorder. However, oral sulfonylurea therapy appears to be more effective in controlling hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/30,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,36,37</a>]. In a study of 49 patients with neonatal diabetes due to activating mutations of the <em>KCNJ11</em> gene, 44 were able to discontinue insulin therapy after starting oral sulfonylurea therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In patients switched to sulfonylurea therapy, insulin secretion and glycated hemoglobin improved (8.1 to 6.4 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SUR1 &ndash; Activating mutations of the <em>ABCC8</em> gene, which encodes SUR1 (the type 1 subunit of the sulfonylurea receptor), can cause both transient and permanent forms of neonatal diabetes. In a series of 73 patients with neonatal diabetes, nine had activating mutations of the <em>ABCC8</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Two had permanent diabetes and the others had transient diabetes. The patients were diagnosed at a median of 32 days (range 3 to 125 days). Oral sulfonylurea therapy normalized glycemic control in patients with genetic mutations of SUR1.</p><p/><p>Neonatal diabetes mellitus has also been associated with mutations in other genes including <em>GATA6, RfX6</em>, <em>IPF-1</em>, <em>EIF2AK3</em>, <em>GCK</em>, <em>FOXP3</em>, <em>PTF1A</em>, <em>GLIS3</em>, and the <em>Ins2</em> genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/39-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-56</a>]. In some cases, these mutations result in pancreatic agenesis or hypoplasia, or absent beta cells. As an example, patients with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus due to Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (diabetes mellitus, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia) have been shown to have hypoplastic pancreatic islets and a mutation in the <em>EIF2AK3</em> gene that encodes translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. <em>FOXP3</em> mutations cause a rare, X-linked disorder that presents in infancy with autoimmune endocrinopathy, enteropathy, and eczema.

The first step in management is to decrease the parenteral glucose infusion rate. Reducing the rate to 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute usually lowers the blood glucose concentration. In most cases, this is accomplished by reducing the concentration of the dextrose solution from 10 to 5 percent. If provided with parenteral nutrition solution and lipid emulsion, infants can maintain normoglycemia with the reduced glucose supply by gluconeogenesis from the metabolism of glycerol and amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>However, reducing the glucose infusion rate is a short-term solution because it results in decreased caloric intake and compromises growth. Glucose tolerance typically improves when enteral feedings are established.

Most neonatologists, including the authors, would begin an insulin infusion in infants with persistent hyperglycemia (&gt;200 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11.1 to 13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> despite reductions in glucose infusion rate, and in infants who fail to thrive because of decreased glucose administration resulting in reduced caloric intake.</p><p>The efficacy of insulin therapy was illustrated by a study of 24 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants with glucose intolerance who were randomly assigned to receive standard intravenous (IV) therapy with glucose and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> with or without a continuous insulin infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Over a mean duration of 15 days, insulin therapy resulted in significantly higher glucose infusion rates (20.1 versus 13.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per min), greater nonprotein energy intake (124 versus 86 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day), and greater weight gain (20.1 versus 7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day) compared with controls. There were no differences between groups in mortality or morbidity (eg, hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia).</p><p>Benefit from insulin therapy was also demonstrated in a trial of 23 ELBW infants who became hyperglycemic while receiving glucose at a rate of up to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per min [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However, the early insulin group had a higher mortality rate at 28 days of life.</p><p/><p>This trial was ended early because of concerns of futility with regard to outcomes and concern for potential harm from insulin therapy. Follow-up is ongoing to determine whether the increased incidence of hypoglycemia in the early insulin group had a detrimental effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

In some centers, concentration of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> is used. The solution should be changed every 24 hours or based on the recommendations of the hospital pharmacy.</p><p>The initial step in management of a persistently elevated glucose level is administering a bolus insulin infusion via a syringe pump over 15 minutes at a dose between 0.05 and 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span>. The blood glucose level is monitored every 30 to 60 minutes, and if it remains elevated, the insulin dose is repeated as a bolus every four to six hours. If the glucose level remains elevated after three bolus doses, a continuous infusion is considered at an initial rate of between 0.01 and 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour and is adjusted in small increments up to a maximum rate of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour to maintain glucose levels of 150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 to 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Tighter glycemic control aiming for glucose values substantially below 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> increases the risk of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-hyperglycemia/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H643162384\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The blood glucose concentration should be monitored within 30 minutes to 1 hour of the start of the infusion and after any change in the rate of glucose or insulin infusion.

Whether administration of amino acids during insulin infusion would further reduce proteolysis or increase protein synthesis and improve protein balance is uncertain.</p><p>Based upon the limited current data, we suggest amino acid solution and lipid emulsion also should be administered to infants receiving glucose infusion to provide substrate for gluconeogenesis, spare glucose utilization, and stimulate insulin release.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood glucose concentration should be monitored in all infants receiving intravenous glucose infusions.
