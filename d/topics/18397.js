Many clinicians are familiar with use of BoNT therapy for bladder and urethral dysfunction in patients with neurologic disorders (eg, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis). This agent is now gaining popularity for treatment of otherwise healthy patients with overactive bladder syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, painful bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/interstitial</span> cystitis, and urinary retention following anti-incontinence surgery.</p><p>Use of BoNT for treatment of non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction is reviewed here. Treatment of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, other treatments for urgency incontinence and urinary retention, and the pharmacology of BoNT are discussed separately.

BoNT acts by inhibiting calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine vesicles at the pre-synaptic neuromuscular junction in peripheral nerve endings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Currently, BoNT-A toxin is available within the United States as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> (Botox) and in Europe as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a> (Dysport). The two formulations have different potencies (1 unit of onabotulinumtoxinA is equivalent to approximately 3 to 5 units of abobotulinumtoxinA). Attempts to convert doses between the two drug formulations are not reliable and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">OnabotulinumtoxinA</a> is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of adults with refractory overactive bladder symptoms and detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

A prospective cohort study of repeat BoNT-A injections reported that the median time between injections ranged from 8 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LOWER URINARY TRACT INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower urinary tract dysfunction is a well-known complication of spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular accident, multiple sclerosis, and other neurologic disorders. Use of BoNT to treat these patients is well established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Bladder dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Botulinum toxin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H2790689260\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptom management of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Bladder dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>Significant lower urinary tract dysfunction also occurs in patients without neurologic disease. The use of BoNT in otherwise healthy patients has provided an additional therapeutic option for the conditions discussed in this section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Overactive bladder syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a constellation of symptoms, including urinary urgency and frequency, urgency incontinence, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nocturia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Detrusor overactivity, or involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle, is the physiologic basis of these symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Detrusor overactivity that is not due to neurologic disease is referred to as non-neurogenic or idiopathic.</p><p>First-line therapy for OAB is anti-cholinergic therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral therapy (ie, bladder training or pelvic floor exercises). For patients whose symptoms are refractory to first-line therapy, the use of BoNT provides an effective alternative to more invasive and aggressive treatments (eg, sacral nerve stimulation via surgically implanted electrodes or augmentation cystoplasty). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Comparison with other therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> (BoNT-A) for treatment of idiopathic OAB in adults who have an inadequate response to, or are intolerant of, an anticholinergic medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As a result, US insurance companies now cover intra-detrusor BoNT-A injections for the treatment of neurogenic bladder and urge incontinence refractory to anticholinergic medications.</p><p>Limited data exist on factors that predict treatment outcome of refractory OAB with BoNT-A. In a study of 80 refractory OAB patients (38 women and 42 men), 63.8 percent of patients were successfully treated with injection of a 100 unit BoNT-A dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Success was defined as a Global Response Assessment (GRA) score &ge; 2 at 3 months. Female gender, low overactive bladder symptom scores on preoperative questionnaires, and leakage associated with OAB complaints (OAB-wet) were factors associated with better therapeutic outcomes. A different study reported that women and men (68 and 17) with refractory OAB were more likely to improve with BoNT-A treatment if they stopped anticholinergic medication because of side effects rather than anti-cholinergic inefficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At least one study has reported that treatment efficacy of BoNT-A for refractory OAB declines with repeated injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, BoNT-A therapy appears to treat OAB symptoms that develop after midurethral synthetic sling surgery for stress urinary incontinence. In a study that compared BoNT-A treatment in women with idiopathic OAB with women who developed OAB after synthetic sling surgery, the approximately 40 percent of women in both groups were dry 12 weeks after injection (41.5 percent for idiopathic OAB and 38.8 percent for postoperative OAB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon data from a meta-analysis of 19 trials, ontra-detrusor BoNT-A improves symptoms in patients with non-neurogenic OAB that is refractory to multiple first-line treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the meta-analysis, use of BoNT-A compared with placebo resulted in a significant decrease in episodes of urinary frequency and incontinence after four to six weeks (frequency: 6.5 fewer episodes; incontinence: -1.6) and after 12 weeks (frequency: -3.4; incontinence: -2.7). In subsequent trials comparing BoNT-A with antimuscarinic therapy, BoNT-A injections had similar reductions in the frequency of daily episodes of urgency incontinence compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solifenacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">solifenacin</a> (with possible escalation to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trospium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trospium</a>), and greater reductions compared with solifenacin, in solifenacin-na&iuml;ve women, in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In a trial of 430 patients (mostly women) with OAB who were followed for 3.5 years and could repeat BoNT-A therapy, patients reported mean decreases of -3.8 urgency episodes per day and -2.6 micturitions per day per injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The overall median duration of effect was 7.6 months per injection. </p><p>There are fewer data regarding the use of BoNT-B to treat OAB; the duration of clinical effect appears to be shorter (six weeks in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary retention rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major limitation to the use of intra-detrusor BoNT-A is the rate of post-treatment urinary retention. In randomized trials, 26 to 43 percent of participants had an elevated postvoid residual (&gt;150 to 200 mL) at four to six weeks after BoNT-A treatment; approximately 25 percent of these patients were symptomatic and required self-catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Symptoms of urinary retention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated postvoid residuals resolved in most patients within 9 to 12 weeks. In an observational study of over 200 women who received BoNT-A injections for OAB, risk factors for urinary retention included older age and higher parity, particularly for women with vaginal deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Distinct cut-off points of risk were not identified.</p><p>Some data suggest that detrusor injection combined with urethral injection of BoNT-A decreases the rate of urinary retention, with a minimal increase in de novo stress urinary incontinence or spontaneous urinary leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This approach requires further investigation.</p><p>Further study is needed to determine the dose and technique of BoNT-A therapy that best reduces the rate of post-treatment self-catheterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparison with other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to BoNT, other treatments for refractory urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) include augmentation cystoplasty and sacral nerve stimulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Augmentation cystoplasty (ie, surgery to make the bladder larger) is associated with high morbidity, which limits its use to individuals with severe incontinence. Candidates are typically patients with neurogenic urgency incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Urinary complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sacral nerve stimulation (SNM) involves minimally invasive surgery to implant an electrical stimulation device into the patient's buttock and an electrode into the S3 sacral foramina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Repeated electrical stimulation of the S3 nerve root lessens UUI symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urgency-incontinence-overactive-bladder-in-women#H4009993299\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urgency incontinence/overactive bladder in women&quot;, section on 'Procedural and other therapies'</a>.)</p><p/><p>As treatment efficacy of BoNT-A and SNM are similar, patient tolerances regarding procedure invasiveness, duration of therapy, and complications drive the treatment choice. Intravesical BoNT is associated with a higher rate of self-catheterization and a shorter duration of efficacy, but it is a reversible procedure that can be performed in the office setting with local anesthesia. Sacral nerve stimulation has equivalent success rates but is an invasive procedure performed in an operating room setting, although a three- to four-day trial stimulation can be done in the office (via placement of a temporary percutaneous nerve electrode [PNE] under local anesthesia). If the trial is satisfactory, patients can then proceed to the operating room for permanent electrode placement. An additional benefit of SNM is that it appears to treat other pelvic floor disorders such as chronic constipation, fecal incontinence, and pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. While the SNM device battery must be changed approximately every five years, newer chargeable options are emerging that may limit this need in the future. Of note, as of 2016, SNM devices are not compatible magnetic resonance imaging. </p><p>The data supporting the above approach comes from an open-label trial (ROSETTA) of 364 women comparing BoNT-A with SNM for refractory UUI. The trial reported that women in the BoNT-A group had greater reduction in six-month mean number of episodes of urgency incontinence per day (-3.9 versus -3.3 episodes per day), improvement in symptom-bother questionnaires, treatment satisfaction, and treatment endorsement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, while reduction in symptoms was statistically greater for the BoNT-A group, it is not known if this difference is clinically important. There were no differences in convenience, adverse effects, and treatment preference, but the women receiving BoNT had more urinary tract infections (35 versus 11 percent for BoNT-A and SNM, respectively). In the BoNT-A group, self-catheterization was performed by 8 percent of women at one month and 2 percent of women at six months. For comparison, 3 percent of women with SNM required device revision or replacement. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p>Whereas intravesical BoNT-A is a cystoscopic office procedure, SNM requires a test phase followed by surgical implantation of the device in the patient's buttock and an electrode into the S3 sacral foramina. In the above systematic review of SNM treatment, common complications included pain at the implant or lead site (25 percent of patients), wound problems (7 percent), and adverse effects on bowel function (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. On the other hand, sacral nerve stimulation does not result in urinary retention and can last for 10 to 15 years. For comparison, BoNT-A injections are often repeated yearly. A cost-effectiveness analysis calculated that two years of treatment with BoNT-A would be less expensive than sacral nerve stimulation (USD $4392 versus $15,743) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, longer-term treatment with SNM may be less expensive, particularly once rechargeable devices become readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OAB has been treated with 100 to 300 U of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]; the optimal dose is under investigation. Given that onabotulinumtoxinA is packaged in 100 U vials, many clinicians inject 100 U at the first treatment, given the lower potential for urinary retention than with higher doses. In our practice, we use 100 U in patients with idiopathic OAB and 200 U in patients with neurogenic incontinence. As noted above, the duration of action varies (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dosage and duration of action'</a> above). Most clinicians repeat dosing every 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Different doses were investigated in a randomized trial in which 75 patients with non-neurogenic or neurogenic detrusor overactivity were assigned to either 100, 150, or 200 U of suburothelial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. At three-month follow-up, the rate of continence was similar for patients who received 100, 150, or 200 U (35, 36 and 41 percent). The patients who received 100 U had a significantly lower incidence of a large postvoid residual urine volume (&ge;150 mL) than did those who received 150 or 200 U (30.4 percent versus 52 percent and 72 percent). The duration of therapeutic effectiveness was significantly shorter for the patients treated with 100 U compared with those treated with 150 or 200 U (3.5 versus 5.5 and 6.7 months).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients often experience mild pain or discomfort at the injection site or in the suprapubic area for several days after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Transient mild hematuria may also occur. Patients should call their clinician if they have any adverse effects from the injection, including urinary retention, severe or persistent hematuria, muscle weakness.</p><p>Since urinary retention is a common adverse event of detrusor injection of BoNT, we give all patients preoperative instruction in intermittent self-catheterization along with an instruction sheet and necessary supplies. We review the symptoms of urinary retention with patients; these include: inability to voluntarily void <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a sensation that the bladder is persistently full.</p><p>We see patients with symptoms of urinary retention in the office for evaluation. We advise these patients to self-catheterize after voiding at least three times daily (morning, afternoon, and bedtime) and to keep a diary of voided versus catheterized urine volume. We tell patients to stop self-catheterization when the catheterized volume is consistently &lt;100 cc. Patients with urinary retention often require self-catheterization for two to four weeks after BoNT injection. General principles of urinary catheterization are discussed separately.

The toxin is injected via cystoscope into 10 to 20 sites throughout the detrusor muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64588\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64588 \">figure 1</a>). Use of either a rigid or flexible cystoscope has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Techniques to prevent backflow during injection of BoNT include: filling the bladder to near capacity or use of ultrafine needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/34,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,44,45</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic cystourethroscopy for gynecologic conditions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some debate exists regarding whether suburothelial injections are more effective than intra-detrusor injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

A randomized trial (n = 15) comparing detrusor with suburothelial injection in detrusor overactivity unresponsive to anticholinergic medications found no significant difference between the two injection sites in rates of treatment success (93 versus 80 percent) or elevated postvoid residual (33 versus 47 percent). The difference in outcome reported here appears to be clinically significant; lack of statistical significance is likely due to the small study size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>The optimal intra-vesical anatomic location for BoNT-A injections is also unclear. Concerns have been raised that injections into the trigone may cause vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) as a result of inhibition of the active trigonal antireflux mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. However, a meta-analysis of six studies including 258 patients (male and female) reported no difference between trigonal and extratrigonal BoNT-A in complication rates, including acute urinary retention, high post-void residual, urinary tract infection, hematuria, postoperative muscle weakness. Short-term cure rates (three to eight weeks) were also similar. This study is limited by inclusion of mixed populations (male and female) and short-term follow-up.

Transurethral injection may be performed via cystoscopy in both men and women, with multiple injections given circumferentially at the level of the bladder neck.</p><p>Paraurethral injection is performed by using EMG with injection capability. The urethral sphincter muscle is identified using an EMG signal and then BoNT is injected. Unfortunately, this technique can be technically challenging, requires sophisticated EMG, and the urethral signal can easily be confused with the surrounding perineal musculature.</p><p>Several authors have commented on the feasibility of transperineal injection facilitated by ultrasound guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">How to manage accidental overdose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients planning to receive BoNT injection should be warned of potential muscle weakness and pulmonary collapse as rare complications of the therapy. The lethal dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> in humans is estimated to be 2800 units for a 70 kg person, as noted above (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dosage and duration of action'</a> above). An antidote is available for overdoses, but is only useful acutely and will not help long-lasting symptoms of muscle paralysis. With the small amounts of BoNT used clinically, it is not generally recommended that physicians administering BoNT have the antitoxin on hand. However, adequate supportive care facilities (ie, intensive care unit) and a local health department that has a supply of antitoxin should be accessible on the rare chance that an overdose occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;, section on 'Antitoxin'</a>.)</p><p>Antitoxin should be reserved for patients who demonstrate significant cardiopulmonary compromise thought to be secondary to BoNT toxin overdose.
