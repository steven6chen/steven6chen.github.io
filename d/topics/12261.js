Thus, somatic cells have only a few active X chromosome genes, whereas germ cells have two complete X chromosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The primordial undifferentiated germ cells then migrate during the fourth to eighth weeks of gestation from the yolk sac to the gonadal ridge, where they are required for development of the ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the absence of a testicular differentiation factor from the Y chromosome, which directs the production of m&uuml;llerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) by four to six weeks gestation in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], the germ cells differentiate into primitive oogonia, which begin mitosis at approximately six weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sexual development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A quantitative morphologic study of germ cells in 17 normal human fetuses revealed a maximum of seven million germ cells five months after conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; this small study remains the basis of most of our current understanding of oogenesis in humans. The first meiotic division is initiated at approximately 15 weeks, signaling the transformation of oogonia to oocytes. This meiotic division is then arrested at the first prophase until primordial follicles are formed. Medullary structures infiltrate the ovarian cortex and surround the oocytes to invest each one with a single layer of primordial granulosa cells at approximately 20 weeks of gestation, thereby beginning the formation of primordial follicles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous follicular growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follicular and ovarian growth have been studied in late gestational fetuses and prepubertal children, using autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Follicular growth is initiated in the fetus in a continuous pattern that is independent of gonadotropins and is apparently related to both the total mass of follicles and to factors released by atretic follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Follicles are capable of growth up to the preantral (preluminal) stage in the absence of gonadotropins, based upon studies of girls with congenital deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (Kallmann syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and anencephalic fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The ovaries of normal human fetuses, infants, and prepubertal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>] contain larger antral follicles. These follicles are probably formed in response to low levels of pulsatile FSH and LH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], based upon studies using very sensitive gonadotropin assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous follicular atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As soon as primordial follicles are formed in the fetus, before there is detectable follicular responsiveness to FSH, inexorable cycles of follicular growth and subsequent atresia begin. These cycles result in an exponential fall in oocyte number even <strong>before birth</strong>.</p><p>The atresia is a poorly understood process of follicular degradation. It can apparently occur at any point during follicular growth and development and may be associated with reinitiation of meiosis.

In a follow-up report by the same investigators, the bone marrow was identified as the possible source of the germline stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, other investigators have reported that bone marrow cells do <strong>not</strong> contribute to the formation of mature, ovulated oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In a 2009 report, female germline stem cells were isolated from neonatal mice and transplanted into sterile adult mice, who then were able to produce offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a second study, oogonial stem cells were isolated from neonatal and adult mouse ovaries; pups were subsequently born from the oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Further experiments are needed before the implications for humans can be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN FUNCTION DURING THE REPRODUCTIVE YEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful autopsy studies of small numbers of women who died prematurely revealed a steady exponential decline in oocyte number throughout early adult life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/3,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32,33</a>]; however, only small numbers of older women have been studied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72948 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Thus, there is uncertainty about the rate of decline in oocyte numbers during these years.</p><p>A study evaluated the menstrual cycles, serum hormone concentrations, and oocyte viability in young women and older women who were still having regular menstrual cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Oocyte viability declined in older women before they had any measurable decrease in serum or intrafollicular hormone concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These results may explain the gradual decrease in fecundity after age 30 to 35 years in normal women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80807\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80807 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The isolated increases in serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations that are found in some normally cycling older women are probably caused by decreasing ovarian production of inhibin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77945 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MENOPAUSAL YEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menopause occurs at a mean age of 51 years in normal women in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>). It is associated with a marked decline in oocyte number that is attributable to progressive atresia of the original complement of oocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72948 \">figure 1</a>). However, the evidence for absolute oocyte depletion at this time is limited. Residual oocytes and differentiating follicles have been identified in the ovaries of some postmenopausal women, although the follicles are frequently atretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>The decrease in developing follicles is reflected in a parallel decrease in the serum concentration of inhibin B, which is probably the earliest, easily measurable marker of follicular decline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77945 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The rise in the serum concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in early menopause is also closely related to the fall in inhibin B; this suggests that inhibin B plays an important role in the normal control of FSH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Serum concentrations of m&uuml;llerian-inhibiting substance (MIS; also known as anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone [AMH]) may be a useful marker reflecting reproductive aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Low serum AMH concentrations were predictive of a poor ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation and may mark a critical juncture in the timing of the menopausal transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Menopausal transition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the progressive decline in ovarian function results in cycle disruption, the normal menopausal transition (also known as perimenopause) can last for several years.

As noted above, inhibin B and AMH concentrations fall due to a decline in follicular number, and as a result, serum FSH levels begin to rise, with relative preservation of estradiol secretion (normal or high estradiol levels), but with low luteal phase progesterone concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77945 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79769\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79769 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/40-42,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42,48,49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the late menopausal transition, cycle variability increases. In addition, fluctuations in serum concentrations of FSH and estradiol may be quite striking; high FSH and low estradiol values may be suggestive of menopause, but soon thereafter FSH and estradiol may return to the normal premenopausal range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations and endocrinology of the menopausal transition are reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

This was illustrated in a study of 160 perimenopausal women with anovulatory menstrual cycles who collected daily urine samples (across one cycle) for gonadotropin and sex steroid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Some cycles were characterized by normal preovulatory levels of estrogen, but no luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, suggesting a failure of estrogen-positive feedback, while in others, normal follicular phase estrogen levels did not suppress LH secretion, indicating a failure of estrogen-negative feedback.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179689159\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average age of menopause, defined as permanent cessation of menses, is age 51 years in normal women.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy#H12798793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elective oophorectomy or ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Early menopause following hysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newer techniques of ovarian ultrasonography have revealed small (1 to 3 mm) cysts in the ovaries of women many years after the menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. These cysts probably represent secondary follicles, because a primordial follicle cannot begin to grow and mature unless it contains a viable oocyte, and follicles are the major cystic structures in the ovaries. It is not clear how long an intact oocyte must be present for follicular growth to occur and antral fluid to accumulate, and ultrasonography cannot detect follicular atresia. As a result, the importance of these small cysts in postmenopausal women is currently unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroendocrine changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging is associated with changes in hypothalamic-pituitary, as well as ovarian, function. The FSH and LH secreted by postmenopausal women contain more carbohydrate, and the serum half-lives of the hormones are prolonged, as compared with young women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The prolonged half-life contributes to the high serum FSH and LH concentrations found in older women. In addition, the FSH and LH secreted by older women may be less biologically active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Thus, some of the decline in ovarian function at the time of the menopause may be due to changes in the quantity or quality of the hormones secreted by the hypothalamus and pituitary or the pattern of their secretion, rather than to a primary loss of ovarian responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. However, the poor response to exogenous administration of gonadotropins in older women undergoing in vitro fertilization argues against this possibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nomenclature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nomenclature for the different phases of reproductive senescence has been confusing. In an attempt to define the stages of reproductive aging and its clinical and biochemical markers, the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) was held to develop a useful staging system and to revise the nomenclature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 4</a>). This system provides useful clinical definitions of the menopausal transition, perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follicular growth is initiated in the fetus in a continuous pattern that is independent of gonadotropins and is related to both the total mass of follicles and to factors released by atretic follicles.
