Before discussing these modalities, it is helpful to briefly review the determinants of solute clearance with peritoneal dialysis. The rates (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> of peritoneal blood flow and dialysate flow with peritoneal dialysis are well below those achieved with hemodialysis (where both are often above 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>. Thus, the clearance of urea and other small solutes per unit time is much less with peritoneal dialysis than with hemodialysis. However, peritoneal dialysis is often performed in a continuous fashion so that the weekly solute clearances approach those with hemodialysis.</p><p>When discussing removal of solutes from the body by dialysis, we generally talk about two processes: diffusion and convection. It is important to appreciate that rates of diffusion for various solutes vary by molecular weight. The molecular weight for urea is very small, so urea rapidly diffuses into the peritoneal dialysate (which initially contains no urea) so that the average dialysate-to-plasma urea ratio is 0.7 at two hours and 0.9 at four hours. Comparable values for creatinine (a slightly larger molecule) are 0.45 and 0.65, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75224\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75224 \">figure 1</a>); other larger molecular weight solutes diffuse much more slowly. Thus, urea and other small solutes are rapidly removed in the first few hours of a dwell; after four hours, there is very little further removal of small solutes due to near equilibration in concentrations. There is, however, continued removal of larger solutes, which do not equilibrate as rapidly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peritoneal dialysis can be performed in a continuous or intermittent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) involves multiple exchanges during the day (usually three), followed by an overnight dwell. A modification involves one nighttime exchange with an exchange device, resulting in two overnight exchanges and three exchanges during the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There used to be a device designed specifically for this option (the nightly exchange device); however, this device is no longer available. As a result, this modification of CAPD is seldom used; when it is used, a standard cycler is required.</p><p>Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) uses a cycler to perform multiple overnight exchanges. Modifications to this technique include continuous cycler peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD), and tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CCPD has a long daytime dwell (typically called a &quot;last bag fill&quot; [LBF]) and several cycles overnight. A minority of patients undergoing CCPD do not have a daytime dwell (&quot;dry day&quot;), while some patients must also do a &quot;midday exchange&quot; (MDE) to meet adequacy or ultrafiltration targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some intermittent techniques, such as NIPD or intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD), have treatment periods (&quot;wet&quot; abdomen) alternating with times during which the peritoneal cavity has been drained of dialysate (&quot;dry&quot; abdomen).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TPD is a modification of cycler therapy in which exchanges consist of a partial drain (usually 80 to 90 percent of instilled volume plus anticipated ultrafiltration from that dwell). The peritoneal cavity always contains 250 to 400 cc of dialysate, which may improve comfort and facilitates drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The patient may or may not have a daytime dwell.</p><p/><p>The intermittent regimens typically utilize multiple short dwells and automated technology to operate at near maximum solute clearance rates. Of the intermittent techniques, TPD is infrequently used because it is relatively expensive (requires a larger amount of dialysate) and is technically more difficult to perform. When prescribing TPD, one must remember to not only drain the tidal volume, but also any expected ultrafiltration that may have occurred during that dwell. Increased solute clearances have also not been confirmed in all patients, despite such findings in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Most frequently, TPD is used to minimize discomfort and drainage problems in selected patients. As recommended in the European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG), it can also be used in those with <span class=\"nowrap\">inflow/outflow</span> pain and in patients with slow peritoneal drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) is another technique in which two peritoneal catheters or one catheter with two ports provide for the continuous inflow and outflow of dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since the dialysate is constantly refreshed, clearances of some solutes similar to that obtained with short daily hemodialysis can be obtained. CFPD was first introduced decades ago but was subsequently abandoned because of technical and financial limitations.</p><p>There was briefly a renewed interest in this technique because of the increased recognition of frequently inadequate clearances with other peritoneal dialysis modalities and the introduction of technical innovations that made CFPD more feasible. One crossover study of five patients found that CFPD enhanced diffusive transport and the mean ultrafiltration rate compared with NIPD and nightly TPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Additional study is required to better understand the practicality of this technique. This technology would have required use of increased amounts of peritoneal dialysis fluids or reprocessing of the spent dialysate, both increasing the cost over that of conventional peritoneal dialysis therapies. As of 2014, in the United States, there is no method to supplement the typical reimbursement for peritoneal dialysis. It is thus possible that the lack of interest in CFPD is related to multiple issues, including but not limited to the success of other peritoneal dialysis technologies, the financial constraints of peritoneal dialysis reimbursement, and the success of technologies for daily hemodialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTINUOUS AMBULATORY PERITONEAL DIALYSIS VERSUS AUTOMATED PERITONEAL DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important question is whether there are unique clinical advantages among the different continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) modalities. Although there is a paucity of data, CAPD and APD appear to provide similar selected clinical outcomes, including mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This was shown in a systematic review of three randomized, controlled trials that consisted of 139 patients undergoing either APD or CAPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Both peritoneal dialysis modalities resulted in similar mortality and hospitalization rates, risk of peritonitis, and fluid leaks. APD may be associated with relatively more time for work and social activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective, multicenter, cohort, five-year study of 87 APD and 562 CAPD patients, overall mortality and the incidence of technique failure were the same with both techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a retrospective review of the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data set including 66,381 patients (42,942 on CAPD and 23,439 on APD), there was no significant difference in technique survival or all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a retrospective, single-center review including 282 patients on peritoneal dialysis in Taiwan (121 on CAPD and 161 on APD), there was a lower all-cause mortality in APD patients as a group, but, in a subgroup analysis of patients over 65 years of age, APD was associated with a higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>One review of nine studies (including one small, randomized, controlled trial and eight retrospective, observational, cohort studies) comparing CAPD and APD suggested that the selection of peritoneal dialysis modality is not an important determinant of death risk for peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The relative effects of CAPD and APD on residual renal function, peritonitis, volume control, and technique survival are controversial. A clinically relevant difference between modalities on residual kidney function has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As an example, a large, observational study of 505 CAPD and 78 APD patients showed a higher risk of complete loss of renal function in the first year associated with APD compared with CAPD (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.66, 95% CI 1.60-4.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, no difference was detected in the systemic review cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Larger randomized trials are needed to definitively answer this question.</p><p>Similarly, there appear to be no differences between modalities in other outcomes (peritonitis, volume management, and technique survival) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. However, there may be some differences in outcomes that are related to the understanding and utilization of the modality rather than the modality (CAPD or APD) itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSIS PRESCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>How to choose between the modalities will be reviewed below. At the start of dialysis, when patients have some residual renal function, most patients could do any peritoneal dialysis technique and usually be able to achieve their <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and volume control targets. However, once residual kidney function is negligible, modality choice may need to change and better match dwell times to peritoneal transport characteristics to optimize solute clearance and ultrafiltration. Despite those theoretical considerations, however, most patients could do continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), if one is willing to individualize the patient's prescription. To optimize ultrafiltration and solute clearance, it is helpful to first discuss the factors that determine the dialysis prescription.</p><p>At times, it will be important to individualize the patient's dwell times and dwell volumes so that the target dose of peritoneal dialysis can be achieved. As an example, peritoneal dialysis is considered adequate in most patients if the weekly total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> for urea is at least 1.7 and, if considering creatinine clearance, the weekly creatinine clearance is at least 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/week/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (with some variation based upon transporter status; see next section). Attainment of these goals must be documented and then monitored over time. It is often necessary, for example, to increase the patient's dialysis prescription (usually by increasing the number of exchanges or the dwell <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/exchange)</span> as residual renal function is lost or there is a decrease in the peritoneal membrane transport characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal equilibration test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the start of dialysis, peritoneal membrane transport is not known. Once stable on peritoneal dialysis, in order to optimize a peritoneal dialysis prescription, a test to characterize peritoneal dialysis membrane transport (such as a peritoneal equilibration test [PET]) is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-equilibration-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal equilibration test&quot;</a>). Based upon published norms, the patient's transport characteristics are classified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65815\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65815 \">figure 2</a>). The dwell time can then be matched to the transport type in an effort to maximize daily clearances and ultrafiltration while minimizing glucose absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The PET is usually performed after approximately one month on peritoneal dialysis to minimize early effects peritoneal dialysis fluids may have on membrane transport. However, during training, the observed drain volume after a two-hour dwell with 2.5 percent dextrose tends to be predictive of transport type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapid transporters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consider, for example, the problem in &quot;rapid&quot; transporters of creatinine from the blood to dialysate. These patients achieve almost total equilibration between plasma and dialysate for urea and creatinine in a few hours. They also are rapid absorbers of dialysate glucose, thereby removing the osmotic stimulus to ultrafiltration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65815\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65815 \">figure 2</a>). The net effect is that they often begin to absorb dialysate after two to three hours, resulting in reductions in ultrafiltration volume and net solute clearance (as the solutes that have diffused into the dialysate are also absorbed back into the systemic circulation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62604 \">figure 3</a>). In this setting, standard CAPD, which utilizes prolonged dwell times, might not produce sufficient fluid or solute removal. This would necessitate the more frequent use of hypertonic dialysate (2.5 or 4.25 percent dextrose), potentially inducing hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight gain from the increase in glucose absorption, or use of an alternative osmotic agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>. A better alternative in many cases is multiple short dwells with standard dialysate, as with nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-transporters-on-maintenance-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid transporters on maintenance peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Slow transporters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The findings are different in &quot;slow&quot; transporters, who need long dwell times to adequately remove small solutes. Ultrafiltration is not a problem in this setting, since glucose is also slowly absorbed. The figure, for example, shows the findings of a 2 liter dwell volume with a four-hour dwell time using 2.5 percent dextrose dialysate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62604 \">figure 3</a>). A slow transporter will have an adequate drain volume of 2.7 liters, but only 1.2 liters of creatinine clearance (ie, large drain volume but poorly saturated effluent). A rapid transporter, on the other hand, will have a higher solute clearance but may have a drain volume that is actually less than the instilled volume (ie, highly saturated effluent but low drain volume). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-transporters-on-maintenance-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid transporters on maintenance peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Residual renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients typically have some residual renal function when they are started on maintenance dialysis. In this setting, it may not be as important to match dwell time with transporter type, since the urine volume can replace the need for ultrafiltration and the minimal renal solute excretion augments that due to dialysis. Many patients present with uremia or biochemical findings that necessitate the urgent start of dialysis. These patients may have enough residual kidney function so that a full dose of dialysis is not needed. One often starts peritoneal dialysis in both the &rdquo;planned start&rdquo; setting and the &quot;urgent start&quot; setting with a dialysis dose that, when added to the residual renal clearance, results in a total (residual kidney and peritoneal) solute clearance or removal that is at target. As the residual kidney function decreases, the peritoneal component of the total is increased. This is termed &quot;incremental&quot; dialysis dosing. In these cases, one might only need to do two exchanges a day (one overnight dwell and one daytime dwell [a form of CAPD] or two overnight dwells [a form of APD]) or a form of intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) at initiation (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent peritoneal dialysis'</a> below). As the residual renal function gradually decreases over time, increasing the number of exchanges and matching of dwell time to transport type become important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS MODALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients on peritoneal dialysis in the United States are on a form of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). Variations of APD include continuous cycler peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD), tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD), and intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD).</p><p>We use CCPD in most patients. In our unit, over 75 percent of patients use CCPD. In CCPD, a cycler delivers three to six exchanges while the patient sleeps, with a 12- to 15-hour daytime dwell (or last bag fill [LBF]). Weekly clearances are similar to those obtained with CAPD, but more dialysate fluid is generally required each day. Some evidence suggests that ultrafiltration rates may be lower with automated forms of therapy unless one carefully modifies the prescription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We are generally able to achieve adequacy and ultrafiltration goals by individualizing their prescriptions.</p><p>We occasionally use NIPD in patients who are just starting dialysis and have significant residual kidney function or in small patients who are rapid transporters. NIPD is a modification of cycler therapy in which patients perform multiple nightly exchanges over 8 to 10 hours and do not utilize a daytime dwell. It is important to note that the absence of a daytime dwell significantly compromises potential middle molecule and larger molecular weight solute clearances.</p><p>We use TPD in patients who have fill or drain pain or in patients who have problems with drain. As noted above, TPD is a modification of any APD therapy in which exchanges consist of a partial drain (usually 80 to 90 percent of instilled volume plus anticipated ultrafiltration from that dwell). In TPD, the peritoneal cavity always contains at least some dialysate.</p><p>We use IPD in hospitalized patients. In IPD, the patient may do multiple exchanges over 8 to 12 hours and occasionally up to 24 hours.</p><p>Most units usually allow the patient to choose whichever modality the patient would like to use. We usually let the patient choose between continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and CCPD based upon lifestyle or personal issues (such as the desire to work, wish to not do any exchanges during the day, or in a patient who is not able to do the exchanges themselves). In a prospective, randomized study, CCPD provided significantly more time for work, family, and social activities than CAPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Sleep apnea may also be more responsive to nocturnal peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Further recommendations are made after the dialysis dose has been documented with a 24-hour dialysate collection for volume and creatinine clearance or <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> or it is determined from the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) that a change in prescription is needed.</p><p>The patient should also be monitored over time for the loss of residual renal function. The associated fall in solute clearance can usually be reversed by increasing the dialysis prescription via an increase in the dwell volume or the number of exchanges per day. Either of these modalities will raise the net dialysate flow rate, thereby enhancing the clearance of urea and other small solutes by maintaining a favorable concentration gradient for solute diffusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66264 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>In general, APD is superior to CAPD in optimizing small solute removal in some patients, such as rapid transporters. But, to do so, one often needs to either use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a> for their LBF or do a midday exchange (MDE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Automated techniques can combine larger dwell volumes, long nocturnal sessions, and add daytime exchanges, thereby moderately increasing solute and fluid removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Body surface area</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to transport type, residual renal function, and lifestyle choice, another factor to consider when prescribing peritoneal dialysis is body surface area because both the preferred urea-based metric <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/V)</span> and the weekly creatinine clearance are normalized to body size. For example, an absolute creatinine clearance of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/week</span> represents different degrees of dialytic solute removal in small versus large patients since the absolute clearance of creatinine in <span class=\"nowrap\">L/week</span> is then normalized to body surface area (ie, per 1.72 m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Large patients typically need high-dialysate volumes, particularly if they are slow transporters and have no residual renal function. With CAPD, the dwell volume is typically 2.5 or 3 liters, and some patients require five exchanges per day.</p><p>Large, anuric patients who are on CCPD will often need 12 to 14 hours of dwell time while on the cycler with a LBF, using large instilled volumes of dialysate; an alternative is a shorter cycler time (9 to 11 hours) plus one or two daytime exchanges. A large instilled volume is also required during the daytime dwell, and some patients need to perform one manual CAPD exchange to meet the goal for solute clearance. However, increasing the nightly dialysate flow may be superior to adding a manual daytime exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of intermittent therapies has evolved as we have become better able to match dwell time and volume to transport characteristics. In general, because of the presence of residual kidney function, many patients can start dialysis with a low dose of peritoneal dialysis or on an intermittent therapy. However, as residual kidney function declines, the prescription will likely need to increase. This approach is called &quot;incremental dialysis&quot; prescribing. As an example, rapid transporters do best with <strong>short dwells</strong> and may initially achieve adequate dialysis clearances with a &quot;dry&quot; day option on APD. At the initiation of dialysis, if one still had enough residual kidney function, one might only have to do IPD for a six- to eight-hour session three or four days a week. In this case, the patient could even get the treatment at a dialysis center (&quot;in-center peritoneal dialysis,&quot; often utilized during the practice of &quot;urgent-start&quot; peritoneal dialysis) until ready to train for peritoneal dialysis, or a permanent hemodialysis access can be placed.</p><p>However, as residual kidney function decreases, the frequency of the IPD treatment will need to be increased, eventually becoming a daily routine (such as NIPD). If NIPD is used with 8 to 12 hours of overnight dialysis, the dwell time may be only one to two hours per exchange with 1.5 to 2 liter dwell volumes. This requires the use of 8 to 20 liters of dialysate fluid per day. Adequate solute clearances can be achieved with this regimen even though the patient has a &quot;dry&quot; day. However, unless residual renal function is significant, most patients need a &quot;wet&quot; day. Among patients who are rapid transporters, the solution used for the long dwell should be carefully selected in order to avoid lymphatic absorption; such patients may need to use an osmotic agent other than dextrose such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a> or will need to do an MDE.</p><p>It is currently estimated that at most 10 to 15 percent of patients might do best with NIPD or daytime ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (DAPD). DAPD is similar to NIPD, except that the exchanges are performed manually during the day.</p><p>Classic IPD is a form of dialysis in which multiple short exchanges are performed on an intermittent basis. A typical regimen consists of 12 to 15 2-liter, one-hour dwells performed three or four days per week. Over 50 hours of dialysis is required to attain clearances similar to CAPD. However, even higher target doses of dialysis are recommended because of the peaks in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) occurring on the off-dialysis days. For these reasons, this form of peritoneal dialysis is not recommended for chronic use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) involves multiple exchanges during the day (usually three), followed by an overnight dwell. Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) refers to techniques that use an automated device to do multiple exchanges overnight, with or without a daytime dwell, such as continuous cycler peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD), and tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD). Of these, CCPD, the most commonly used, has a long daytime dwell and several cycles overnight. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of peritoneal dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon initiating peritoneal dialysis, we usually let the patient choose the modality (most commonly either CAPD or CCPD) based upon lifestyle or personal issues since the choice is unlikely to matter as far as achieving <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and ultrafiltration goals. This is because most patients initially have significant residual renal function. Over time, the prescription typically has to be modified because of the loss of renal function. The principal factors that determine the optimal peritoneal dialysis prescription are membrane transport type, degree of residual renal function, lifestyle choice, and body surface area. In general, APD therapies are recommended for rapid transporters; low transporters who desire to continue with APD therapy will likely require a midday exchange (MDE) to achieve adequate <span class=\"nowrap\">fluid/solute</span> removal. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis prescription'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Choice of peritoneal dialysis modality'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Twardowski ZJ.
