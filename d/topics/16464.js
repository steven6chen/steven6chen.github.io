The pustules are usually distributed in annular or serpiginous patterns and are most commonly located on flexural surfaces and on intertriginous skin. SPD is characterized by its clinical presentation, as its etiology is unknown and its nosology remains controversial.</p><p>In the overwhelming majority of cases, SPD is a chronic and benign condition for which the primary concerns are minimizing morbidity, improving quality of life, and ruling out the presence of an associated internal disease. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> is the treatment of choice for SPD.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of SPD will be reviewed here. Other neutrophilic dermatoses and pustular disorders are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neutrophilic-dermatoses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neutrophilic dermatoses&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-pustular-skin-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with pustular skin lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034266\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since Sneddon and Wilkinson first described SPD in the 1950s, the majority of cases have been reported in women, and generally in women over the age of 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. SPD is considered a rare condition; however, no estimate of global incidence or prevalence is available.</p><p>Although most of the reported cases have occurred in Caucasians, there is no known ethnic or geographic predilection. SPD is observed worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The relatively few cases reported in children tend to be atypical, and some have subsequently been reclassified as forms of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034272\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of SPD is unknown. Cases identified have been distinguished by sterile collections of neutrophils and neutrophil-related cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, leukotriene B4, complement fragments [C5a], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) in the uppermost layers of the epidermis, in conjunction with consistently negative cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. While associated microbes are by definition never found in the skin, the question of possible infectious triggers elsewhere in the body has been debated, and other etiologic triggers or explanations for why this pustular reaction occurs in the subcorneal layer of the skin have not been demonstrated.</p><p>The clinical and histologic presentation of SPD, with annular arrangements of subcorneal sterile pustules, has led some clinicians to classify it as a form of pustular psoriasis (see <a href=\"#H105034284\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous manifestations'</a> below). Meanwhile, the presence of cutaneous and circulating autoantibodies to components of the skin in a subset of patients has led others to consider it an overlap or subtype of pemphigus. Moreover, its coexistence at times with paraproteinemias and myeloma and its clustering with other neutrophilic dermatoses seen with these entities have suggested that SPD may be a cutaneous manifestation of hematologic dyscrasias or cancers (see <a href=\"#H105034308\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> below). What may reconcile these various observations regarding SPD is to view the condition as a reaction pattern in the skin that may result from the convergence of various etiologies that induce a similar subcorneal neutrophilic process to manifest in the skin, and to consider the concept of subtypes.</p><p>The condition historically considered as Sneddon-Wilkinson disease, now considered by some as a &quot;classical&quot; subtype of SPD, has not been thought to be associated with autoantibodies. Patients with negative skin immunofluorescence and serum studies for autoantibodies have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The occasional identification of intraepidermal deposition of IgG and, more commonly, IgA antibodies to structural proteins of the skin on immunofluorescence studies performed on patients with clinical and histologic findings consistent with SPD, has led some clinicians to reconsider the classification of SPD as a variant of the pemphigus family of autoimmune blistering diseases (ie, SPD-type IgA pemphigus) or to consider these cases a pemphigus subtype of SPD or variant of SPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In cases where antibodies to the skin are present, they target proteins called desmocollins, most commonly desmocollin 1; however, disease targeting desmocollins 2 and 3 also has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Desmocollins are members of the cadherin family of structural proteins necessary for cell-to-cell adhesion and are distinct from the desmoglein proteins targeted in pemphigus variants, eg, pemphigus vulgaris (desmoglein 3 and 1) and pemphigus foliaceous (desmoglein 1). When these proteins are targeted, the structural framework linking skin cells together breaks down and vesicles or bullae are formed, the size and thickness of which depend on the level of the skin where the protein target occurs. As desmocollin 1 is found in the more superficial layers of the skin, the result of its loss of function would be small superficial vesicles and pustules that desquamate into fine scale.</p><p>While SPD in many cases occurs as a chronic benign process in individuals with no other identified internal disease, it has also been observed to cluster with the group of neutrophil-mediated dermatoses, eg, pyoderma gangrenosum and associated internal conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-22</a>]. Some of these patients have been found to have underlying paraproteinemias (predominantly IgA monoclonal gammopathies), myeloma, cutaneous manifestations of hyperviscosity, or rarely lymphomas or solid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/23-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-30</a>]. Gammopathies may play a role in pathogenesis, particularly given the association between IgA and neutrophilic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, a clear mechanism has not been established, as immunofluorescence studies are negative in most patients with SPD and not all patients with SPD have an associated gammopathy. (See <a href=\"#H105034308\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034284\"><span class=\"h1\">CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SPD is typically a relapsing and remitting eruption of superficial pustules, predominating on the trunk and proximal extremities and favoring flexural and intertriginous regions (eg, axillae, groin, neck, and inframammary folds) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52552%7EDERM%2F71995\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52552 graphicRef71995 \">picture 1A-B</a>). The face, palmar-plantar regions, and mucosae tend to be spared.</p><p>The pustules of SPD may arise within hours and can develop on normal or mildly erythematous skin. Although the pustules are generally a few millimeters in diameter, patients may also develop larger flaccid bullae that contain sterile pus in the lower portion. These bullae are often called &quot;half-half&quot; blisters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71995%7EDERM%2F101950\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71995 graphicRef101950 \">picture 1B-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The pustules group and coalesce into annular, circinate, or serpiginous configurations, then rupture or desquamate with superficial crust. Pustules often resolve with mild hyperpigmentation.</p><p>The eruption is often asymptomatic, although some patients experience pruritus or a sensation of skin irritation in involved areas. Classically, patients do not have systemic symptoms. If systemic symptoms are present, the clinician should consider an alternative diagnosis or an underlying systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H105034308\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>The course of SPD generally is chronic or recurrent. SPD may subside, resulting in remission, or persist for years. (See <a href=\"#H105034440\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034308\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the majority of cases, SPD occurs in isolation and is confined to the skin. However, SPD can be associated with other cutaneous and systemic conditions, such as Raynaud phenomenon, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and neutrophilic dermatoses (eg, pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/15,16,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,33,34</a>]. There have also been reports of associations with internal diseases, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, acute polyarthritis, SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis) syndrome, amicrobial lymph node suppuration, and aseptic spleen abscesses, as well as with hematologic disorders, such as polycythemia rubra vera and paraproteinemias (predominantly IgA, either kappa or lambda light-chain type, and very rarely IgM and IgG gammopathies), cryoglobulinemia, and even with malignancies, such as myeloma, APUDoma (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation cell-derived tumor), and in very rare cases lymphomas and solid tumors (eg, thymoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/17-31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-31,35</a>]. Conclusions on the strength of these disease associations are limited by the rarity of SPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034320\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SPD is characterized by subcorneal vesicles or pustules composed of predominantly neutrophils with occasional eosinophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79570 \">picture 2</a>). This finding is not specific for SPD. Impetigo, pustular psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), pemphigus foliaceus, and dermatophytosis may present with similar histologic features. Acantholysis may be present, but is not prominent, and typically is a secondary change seen in specimens from older lesions. (See <a href=\"#H105034344\" class=\"local\">'Skin biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034326\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SPD is based upon the recognition of consistent clinical and histologic findings and the exclusion of other disease entities.

However, SPD can occur in other individuals. (See <a href=\"#H105034266\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no serologic tests that confirm a diagnosis of SPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034338\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A full skin examination should be performed in patients with suspected SPD to evaluate for physical signs suggestive of other conditions. The mucosa should not be involved, and nail changes or joint deformities consistent with psoriasis should be absent. The physical examination may also identify clinical signs suggestive of an associated systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H105034356\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for associated disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034344\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsy is important for confirming SPD and should be performed whenever feasible. Ideally, the specimen should include a relatively new intact lesion. A 4 mm punch biopsy usually is sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H105034320\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p>The key histologic finding in SPD is the subcorneal neutrophilic vesicle or pustule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79570 \">picture 2</a>). The absence or minimal presence of epidermal spongiosis in SPD aids in distinguishing SPD from pustular psoriasis, in which spongiosis is more apparent. The lack of pallor, edema, or necrosis in the epidermis and the absence of a psoriasiform pattern of hyperplasia help to distinguish SPD from necrolytic migratory erythema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H105034362\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Fungal stains (eg, periodic acid-Schiff) are useful to rule out fungal infection. Direct immunofluorescence studies should be performed to distinguish antibody-mediated subtype of SPD or variants of pemphigus (eg, IgA pemphigus or pemphigus foliaceous) as well as dermatitis herpetiformis. (See <a href=\"#H105034272\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>Direct immunofluorescence studies for epidermal intercellular IgA staining should be performed periodically in patients with relapsing disease. In some cases, positive direct immunofluorescence studies have developed years after the initial diagnosis of SPD. Thus, immunofluorescence studies may help to identify patients with IgA pemphigus subtypes of the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034350\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A swab culture or tissue culture from punch biopsy should be performed to rule out infectious conditions such as impetigo.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034356\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of an associated disease should be considered in all patients with SPD. Often, a review of systems is useful for identifying symptoms suggestive of extracutaneous associations. In particular, patients should be asked about symptoms associated with rheumatologic, hematologic, or inflammatory bowel disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthralgia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raynaud phenomenon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry eyes or dry mouth (suggestive of Sj&ouml;gren syndrome)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms (suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of livedoid appearance of the arms and legs or bluish discoloration of the fingers and toes (suggestive of hyperviscosity of the blood)</p><p/><p>A thorough physical examination may also identify signs suggestive of underlying disease.</p><p>Laboratory workup can be useful for identifying disorders that may occur in association with SPD. Routine tests to perform on all patients are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complete blood count with differential </strong>&ndash; Evaluates for polycythemia, neutropenia, or lymphopenia seen with rheumatologic conditions that may occur in association with SPD.

Both kappa and lambda light-chains may be seen. IgG and IgM monoclonal gammopathies are rare. Serum protein electrophoresis should be repeated periodically while the patient has active skin disease (eg, once yearly) because paraproteinemia can develop years after the initial presentation of SPD and because of the risk of progression of paraproteinemia to multiple myeloma. If myeloma is suspected, further evaluation is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the review of systems may lead to suspicion for underlying rheumatologic diseases that require further laboratory workup, such as Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and cryoglobulinemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105034362\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of SPD includes other disorders that may present with widespread pustules or annular, circinate, or serpiginous plaques. Examples include pustular psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), impetigo, dermatophytosis, eosinophilic pustular folliculitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, necrolytic migratory erythema, pemphigus foliaceus, and IgA pemphigus. Pustular psoriasis is probably the most difficult entity to distinguish from SPD. Many cases initially diagnosed as SPD subsequently have been found to be pustular psoriasis. (See <a href=\"#H105034272\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generalized pustular psoriasis</strong> &ndash; Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is an uncommon presentation of psoriasis characterized by the acute or subacute development of a widespread pustular eruption. In acute GPP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F94790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94790 \">picture 3</a>), the pustules are accompanied by extensive erythema and systemic symptoms (eg, fever malaise). Generalized annular pustular psoriasis is a subacute presentation that manifests with widespread annular or figurate plaques with pustules. GPP should be suspected in a patient with a patient or family history of psoriasis or nail or joint findings of psoriasis. GPP may also occur as a disorder of pregnancy (impetigo herpetiformis). Like SPD, subcorneal pustules are found in biopsy specimens of GPP. However, epidermal spongiosis is more consistent with GPP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H86559923\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Generalized pustular psoriasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis</strong> &ndash; While both SPD and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) present with the rapid onset of cutaneous pustulosis, AGEP is accompanied by fever and peripheral blood leukocytosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56807\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56807 \">picture 4</a>). Additional findings include eosinophilia, facial edema, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A thorough drug exposure history must be taken to distinguish AGEP and SPD.

Occasionally, pustules are also present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F93727\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93727 \">picture 6</a>). A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can quickly diagnose dermatophytosis. Alternative methods include fungal culture and skin biopsy with fungal stains (eg, periodic acid-Schiff stain).

In contrast to SPD, histopathologic examination of pustules reveals eosinophil-predominant infiltrates rather than neutrophil-predominant infiltrates. Leukocytosis or eosinophilia may also be present. Some cases are associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Involved skin is markedly pruritic, unlike SPD. The classic distribution involves the back, buttocks, and extensor surfaces (especially over extensor aspects of joints), in contrast to the flexural and intertriginous distribution of SPD. Histopathologic examination reveals neutrophil collections and blister formation within the dermal papilla, in contrast to the subcorneal neutrophil collections in SPD.

Unlike SPD, NME is not characterized by pustules. Rather, it presents as a non-specific dermatitis with erythematous patches, blisters, and erosions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76162\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76162 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In NME, there is a predilection for sites of pressure and friction, such as the buttocks, groin, lower abdomen, and lower extremities, as well as mucosal regions (oral mucosa, lips, genital region) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcorneal-pustular-dermatosis/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>]. In SPD, mucosa should be spared. Associated symptoms include unexplained weight loss, diabetes, diarrhea, and stomatitis.

The scalp, face, and trunk are common sites of involvement. Unlike SPD, the subcorneal blisters of pemphigus foliaceus tend to be larger and neutrophil predominance is not characteristic. Acantholysis is a prominent feature of pemphigus foliaceus, but a less prominent feature in SPD. Direct immunofluorescence studies can confirm a diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus.

Both disorders exhibit pustular eruptions in annular or circinate patterns that favor the trunk and proximal extremities and neutrophil-predominant subcorneal vesicles or pustules. It is controversial whether patients in whom clinical and histologic features of SPD are associated with the detection of antibodies against desmocollins are best classified as having a specific subtype of SPD or an SPD-like subtype of IgA pemphigus.
