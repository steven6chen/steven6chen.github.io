Blood is made up of different types of cells. Blood cells are made in the center of your bones, in a part called the bone marrow.</p><p>People with CML have an abnormal gene in some of their blood cells. This gene causes the bone marrow to make abnormal blood cells. These abnormal blood cells can grow out of control, get into the blood, and travel around the body. Sometimes, these cells collect in certain parts of the body.</p><p>When the bone marrow makes abnormal blood cells, it does not make enough of the normal blood cells a person's body needs. This can cause symptoms.</p><p>There are 3 stages, or &quot;phases,&quot; of CML:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the <strong>chronic phase</strong>, the cancer grows very slowly. Most people are in this phase when their CML is diagnosed. This phase can last for years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the <strong>accelerated phase</strong>, the cancer begins to grow faster.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the <strong>blast phase</strong>, the cancer is fast-growing and can be fatal.</p><p/><p>Treatment depends, in part, on the phase of your CML.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397092\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of CML?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CML does not always cause symptoms, especially at first. When it does cause symptoms, the most common ones are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired and weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating much more than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full after eating a small amount of food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding more easily than normal</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397099\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for CML?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you, do an exam, and do blood tests. He or she might also do a bone marrow biopsy. For this test, a doctor takes a small sample of the bone marrow. The sample is then examined under a microscope to see if abnormal (cancer) cells are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397106\"><span class=\"h1\">How is CML treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can treat CML in different ways. When CML is first diagnosed and in the chronic phase, it is treated with pills called &quot;tyrosine kinase inhibitors&quot; or &quot;TKIs.&quot; TKIs kill the blood cells that have the abnormal CML gene. When these blood cells are gone, the bone marrow can work normally again. TKIs do not cure CML, but they can control it for many years. If you take a TKI, it is very important to take every single dose. Skipping pills can allow the CML to grow out of control. Most people with CML must take a TKI for the rest of their life.</p><p>People who have too many side effects from their TKI, or whose CML starts to grow faster, can have other treatments. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another TKI &ndash; Different TKIs have different side effects. Also, one TKI might work better to control your CML than another. If one TKI doesn't work for you, another might.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow transplant (also called &quot;stem cell transplant&quot;) &ndash; This treatment replaces cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation. These &quot;donor&quot; cells can come from another person whose cells match yours in specific ways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A type of medicine called &quot;interferon alfa&quot;</p><p/><p>Treatment also involves regular follow-up visits, exams, and blood tests. Some people, but not everyone, might need additional bone marrow biopsies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397127\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits, tests, and treatment. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for CML involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397134\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukemia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Leukemia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-myeloid-leukemia-cml-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
