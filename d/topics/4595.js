Two related isoforms of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme have been described: COX-1 (PGHS-1) and COX-2 (PGHS-2). COX-1 is involved in gastric cytoprotection. It had been proposed that the ideal NSAID would inhibit the inducible COX-2 isoform (thereby decreasing inflammation) without having any effect on the constitutive COX-l isoform (thereby minimizing gastric toxicity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-inhibitors-and-gastroduodenal-toxicity-major-clinical-trials/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One NSAID that selectively inhibits COX-2, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Rofecoxib is a COX-2 inhibitor that was removed due to an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction with long-term use. Valdecoxib was removed because of concerns of cardiovascular risk and reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. An increased risk of cardiovascular events has also been observed with celecoxib, especially in higher doses. These observations led the FDA to issue warnings regarding the use of these drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other COX-2 inhibitors are available in some countries. Parecoxib is a prodrug that is converted to valdecoxib. Etoricoxib and lumiracoxib are available in some countries. These drugs have at least a 200- to 300-fold selectivity for inhibition of COX-2 over COX-1.

First, it may be related directly to the effect of aspirin, which blocks COX-1 in the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-inhibitors-and-gastroduodenal-toxicity-major-clinical-trials/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Second, aspirin therapy allows COX-2 to produce gastroprotective acids such as lipoxins, which help minimize gastric damage due to aspirin; this gastroprotective effect can be abolished by a COX-2 inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-inhibitors-and-gastroduodenal-toxicity-major-clinical-trials/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the CLASS study, similar rates of ulcers and ulcer complications were noted among those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> plus low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> as among patients receiving a nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) plus low-dose aspirin (2.02 and 2.12 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-inhibitors-and-gastroduodenal-toxicity-major-clinical-trials/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, patients receiving both aspirin and a selective COX-2 inhibitor may require prophylactic antiulcer therapy if they are at increased risk for gastroduodenal toxicity.

The 12-week cumulative incidence of endoscopically detected ulcers was significantly higher in the rofecoxib plus aspirin group than in the aspirin alone group (16.1 percent versus 7.3 percent). The endoscopic ulcer rate of 16.1 percent with rofecoxib plus aspirin was similar to the rate in the ibuprofen group (17.1 percent). The rate of endoscopic ulcers with low-dose aspirin alone (7.3 percent) was numerically higher than the incidence with placebo (5.8 percent), but the difference was not statistically significant.

A limitation of this trial was the lack of a non-NSAID comparator to determine the incremental increase in bleeding risk when patients at high-risk of cardiovascular events and GI bleeding taking aspirin are treated with celecoxib or naproxen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1313517445\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase, thereby impairing the ultimate transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes. There are two isoforms of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme. The COX-1 isoform is involved in gastric cytoprotection, and the COX-2 isoform is increased during states of inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-2 inhibitors appear to be safer than conventional NSAIDs for reduction in the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, but are still associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with placebo. The potential gastroduodenal sparing effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors may be reduced by concurrent low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Concurrent aspirin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients considered to be at exceptionally high risk for peptic ulcer disease, combining a selective COX-2 inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>) with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a>) may confer added protection against GI toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Combined use of COX-2 inhibitors and PPIs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Celecoxib</a> is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Parecoxib, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib are available in some countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Celecoxib</a> produces comparable analgesia and anti-inflammatory effects to nonselective NSAIDs. Compared with nonselective NSAIDs, celecoxib has been associated with fewer endoscopically detectable, but not necessarily fewer clinically significant gastric and duodenal ulcers. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Celecoxib'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valdecoxib has been associated with a substantially lower risk of gastroduodenal damage compared with nonselective NSAIDs. However, valdecoxib was removed from the market in the United States because of concerns related to an increase in cardiovascular events and reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Valdecoxib and parecoxib'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parecoxib is converted to valdecoxib. Short-term parenteral administration of parecoxib has been associated with a lower risk of gastric or duodenal ulceration compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Etoricoxib has been associated with an approximately 50 percent lower incidence of investigator-reported and confirmed adverse upper GI events compared with treatment with nonselective NSAIDs in phase <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III</span> clinical studies. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etoricoxib'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumiracoxib is a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor. In one study, the cumulative incidence of ulcer complications (ie, bleeding, perforation, or obstruction) was significantly lower with lumiracoxib than with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, in patients who were not taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. Reductions in ulcer complications were not apparent in patients concurrently taking aspirin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rofecoxib was found to have a 50 percent relative risk reduction in GI events compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the VIGOR trial. However, in a three-year, placebo-controlled trial for colorectal adenoma chemoprevention, rofecoxib was associated with an increased incidence in clinically relevant upper GI bleeding compared with placebo. Rofecoxib was removed from the market because of an increased risk of MIs and stroke associated with long-term use.
