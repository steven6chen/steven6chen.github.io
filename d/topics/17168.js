In 1948, aminopterin was used to induce remission in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and the related agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) is still an important component of modern treatment for ALL as well as a number of other hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. MTX was the first drug shown to cure a cancer when given as monotherapy, and single agent MTX remains a cornerstone of treatment for malignant gestational trophoblastic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The broad range of antitumor activity seen with MTX is reflected in the large number of malignant conditions for which MTX is a component of the treatment regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60020\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60020 \">table 1</a>). Furthermore, in addition to antiproliferative activity, MTX also has antiinflammatory and immunomodulating properties, leading to its use in a wide range of doses for a broad range of therapeutic indications across multiple specialties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76707 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>This topic review will cover the clinical use of high-dose MTX for treatment of malignancy, focusing on the prevention and management of toxicity. Intrathecal use of MTX and clinical use of low-dose and intermediate-dose MTX for both malignant and nonmalignant conditions are covered elsewhere. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF HIGH-DOSE MTX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The side effect profile of MTX varies markedly according to dose. Regimens containing MTX are classified as high, intermediate, or low-dose:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most clinicians reserve the term high-dose MTX (HDMTX) for doses &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> as are used for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis in patients with leukemia and high-risk lymphoma, and for the treatment of leptomeningeal metastases, primary CNS lymphoma, and osteosarcoma. These regimens deliver an otherwise lethal dose of MTX in a 4 to 36 hour infusion, and require a two to three day period of multiple <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> doses to terminate the toxic effect of MTX (termed leucovorin &quot;rescue&quot;). Successful rescue by leucovorin depends on rapid elimination of MTX by the kidneys, which requires aggressive pretreatment as well as posttreatment hydration and urinary alkalinization. The main toxicities of HDMTX are elevated serum transaminase levels and renal insufficiency, which can delay drug clearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doses between 50 and 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> as used for malignant gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), are considered intermediate-dose MTX. In general, these patients do not require aggressive hydration or urinary alkalinization. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Leucovorin</a> rescue is rarely needed with doses &le;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> unless unexpected toxicity is encountered.

The major side effects of low-dose oral MTX for nonmalignant disorders are addressed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Low doses of MTX (typically 12 mg total dose) also can be given intrathecally for treatment of leptomeningeal metastases or CNS prophylaxis in patients with leukemia or high-risk lymphoma. In this setting, the major toxicities are neurologic; there is a very small risk of myelosuppression because MTX is eliminated from the cerebrospinal fluid by slow passive diffusion into the systemic circulation. Because of this, some experts recommend a short course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> rescue in this situation, particularly for patients with renal dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of leptomeningeal metastases (carcinomatous meningitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MTX enters the cell via the same energy-dependent, saturable carrier protein that transports naturally occurring folates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Some tumors have reduced or no transport capability; in such cases, high extracellular concentrations of MTX permit the drug to enter the cell by passive diffusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A third mechanism of MTX entry is through endocytosis, mediated by folate binding proteins, which may be overexpressed in malignant as compared with normal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of action</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69716673\"><span class=\"h3\">Interference with folate metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antiproliferative activity of antifolates such as MTX results from interference with folate metabolism. A normal dividing cell uses large amounts of reduced folates to maintain ongoing purine and thymidine synthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52756 \">figure 1</a>); demand is even greater for rapidly dividing malignant cells.</p><p>Several key enzymes of these synthetic pathways are targets of MTX:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The critical factor for the cell's ongoing production of thymidylate, and to a lesser extent the purines, is its ability to regenerate reduced folates from the oxidized forms. The key enzyme in this process is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which converts dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, thus continuously replenishing the cell's supply of reduced folates. Competitive inhibition of DHFR represents the main mechanism of action for antifolates such as MTX, but other synthetic enzymes are also inhibited by polyglutamated forms of MTX (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Importance of polyglutamation'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within the thymidine synthetic pathway, the enzyme thymidylate synthetase (TS) uses a methyl group from the reduced folate, 5-methylenetetrahydofolate, to synthesize deoxythymidylate monophosphate (dTMP) from deoxyuridylate monophosphate (dUMP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within the purine synthetic pathway, the enzymes glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARFT) and aminoimidazole carboxamide transformylase (AICARFT) both use the formyl groups of the reduced folate N(10)-formyltetrahydrofolate to initiate synthesis of adenosine and guanosine.</p><p/><p>Intracellularly, MTX competitively inhibits DHFR because it has a higher affinity for the enzyme than the naturally occurring dihydrofolate. The depletion of reduced folates (tetrahydrofolates) causes an abrupt cessation of thymidine synthesis, DNA synthesis, and eventually cell death. This process is accentuated in rapidly dividing cells (ie, those in the S-phase of the cell cycle), which require more DNA precursors. As a result, MTX is considered an S-phase specific cytotoxic drug.</p><p>The level of DHFR in any given cell is in great excess of what is needed to provide normal levels of reduced folates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Furthermore, tetrahydrofolate synthesis continues until more than 95 percent of DHFR activity has been inhibited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As a result, high levels of MTX are required to successfully compete with other folates for DHFR binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Importance of polyglutamation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As part of normal cellular physiology, multiple glutamate residues are added to carboxyfolates by the enzyme folyl polyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), a process referred to as polyglutamation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52756 \">figure 1</a>). Polyglutamation increases the intracellular pool of folates, as polyglutamated folates are not easily transported out of the cell because of their size and charge. Folate polyglutamation also influences the equilibrium balance in favor of continual cellular uptake of folates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>].</p><p>When significant intracellular levels are present, MTX is polyglutamated by the same enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, in most cell lines studied, conversion to polyglutamated MTX (PGMTX) does not occur until cells have been exposed to the drug for at least six hours at concentrations of at least 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromoles/liter</span> (2 microM, 2 X 10 [-6] M) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These concentrations are easily achievable in plasma with HDMTX but not with intermediate or low-dose regimens.</p><p>The accumulation of PGMTX metabolites serves to further amplify and prolong the antiproliferative effects of MTX:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracellular accumulation and decreased efflux of PGMTX enhances and prolongs inhibition of DHFR, since PGMTX is less readily dissociable from the enzyme than is free MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyglutamated forms of MTX also bind to other enzymes involved in DNA synthesis such as TS, AICARFT, and GARFT; this further depletes intracellular thymidine and inhibits purine synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Inhibition of TS also leads to accumulation of dUMP, which cannot be incorporated into DNA, further disrupting DNA synthesis and repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Besides being a main determinant of antitumor activity, MTX polyglutamation is also thought to be mainly responsible for the greater incidence and severity of all HDMTX-related side effects when there is prolonged MTX excretion or if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> rescue is delayed beyond 36 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/10,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-18</a>]. Higher plasma MTX concentrations and longer exposure times increase the formation of longer polyglutamated MTX molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/8,13,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,19,20</a>]. When the polyglutamated tail has a larger number of glutamic acid residues (ie, greater than five), there is greater affinity for DHFR and TS, and degradation and diffusion out of the cell is slowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Finally, variability in polyglutamation between tumor cells and normal (nonmalignant) cells is thought to provide at least part of the explanation for why <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> can selectively rescue normal cells from the effects of HDMTX but does not compromise tumor cell cytotoxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69716653\"><span class=\"h3\">Other mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to involvement of pathways involved in folate metabolism, newer data suggest that upregulation of mitochondrial enzymes involved in the metabolism of serine and glycine may also influence tumor cell sensitivity to MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Whether this finding is relevant to all tumors, especially osteosarcoma, is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Rationale for leucovorin rescue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with many other anticancer drugs, MTX has little selectivity for tumor cells, and its effectiveness is limited by toxicity to normal tissue, particularly the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium and bone marrow. To improve the therapeutic index of MTX, Goldin developed the concept of rescuing normal cells from toxicity by providing reduced folates (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>, also called folinic acid, N5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, citrovorum factor) to bypass the metabolic block induced by MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In these pioneering experiments, administration of leucovorin within 24 to 36 hours after administration of MTX was able to prevent MTX-induced host toxicity without diminishing antitumor activity.</p><p>The reason why <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> selectively rescues normal but not malignant cells is incompletely understood. The original premise that providing reduced folate would circumvent the metabolic block produced by MTX is not easily explained except in situations where folate transport is deficient in the malignant cells. In such cases, leucovorin cannot be transported into the malignant cell, but it can enter normal cells and compete with MTX for binding sites on DHFR because they retain a normal folate carrier protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>]. If leucovorin is present in sufficient quantities, the enzyme is reactivated, and purine and thymidine synthesis can be reinitiated. This situation is thought to be relatively uncommon.</p><p>As noted above, cellular differences in polyglutamation have been suggested as an alternative explanation for selective <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> rescue. Intracellularly, leucovorin is able to compete with free but not polyglutamated MTX for binding to DHFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In contrast to tumor cells, comparatively little PGMTX synthesis occurs in normal gut epithelium and bone marrow precursors under similar conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24</a>]. It is hypothesized that because of the lower levels of intracellular PGMTX, leucovorin can more effectively curtail DHFR inhibition in normal as compared with malignant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/11,14,18,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,18,24-26</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Leucovorin</a> can only rescue normal cells that have not already had lethal DNA damage from the toxic effects of MTX. Thus, to be effective, treatment with leucovorin must be initiated within 24 to 36 hours of starting HDMTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Issues relevant to the dose, route of administration, and duration of leucovorin rescue after HDMTX are discussed below.

(See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Management of patients with renal failure and prolonged high plasma MTX levels'</a> below.)</p><p>Because MTX is not a lipophilic compound, it penetrates only slowly across intact cellular barriers such as the vascular endothelium. Third-space fluid collections (eg, ascites, pleural effusions) can accumulate high levels of the drug that slowly leak back into the circulation long after the initial dose. Particularly if renal function is impaired, this can result in prolonged drug elimination and severe delayed toxicity. If possible, these fluid collections should be drained prior to administration of HDMTX.</p><p>MTX also crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration is variable but CSF levels are approximately 3 to 10 percent of plasma concentrations. Thus, high serum levels (typically requiring IV administration of MTX doses &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> are required to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the CSF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57330627\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with Down syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trisomy 21 cells (ie, those of patients with Down syndrome) appear to have increased cellular accumulation of MTX because of the presence of extra copies of the reduced folate carrier SLC19A1, which is located on chromosome 21.

As a result, protocols using HDMTX for treatment of diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients with Down syndrome generally recommend a reduced MTX dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-toxicity-of-high-dose-methotrexate/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Most protocols recommend at least 2.5 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/m<sup>2</sup></span> of IV fluid hydration per day, starting four to 12 hours prior to the initiation of the MTX infusion.</p><p>The pH of the urine should be measured at baseline. As noted above, MTX precipitates in acid urine; maintaining the urine pH 7.0 or higher increases MTX solubility, prevents drug precipitation in renal tubules, and drastically decreases the chance of renal damage. In clinical practice, it is customary to begin the MTX infusion only after the urine pH is &ge;7.0 and to maintain it in this range until plasma MTX levels have declined to less than 0.1 microM.</p><p>Urinary alkalinization is most easily accomplished by adding ampules of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> to each liter of IV fluid hydration. This accomplishes both fluid hydration and urinary alkalinization.</p><p>A typical choice is IV D5W with 100 to 150 mEq of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> per liter, administered by continuous infusion at 125 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. A cation concentration of 80.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is roughly equivalent to one-half normal saline. The amount of bicarbonate in each liter and the IV fluid composition can then be modified according to the urine pH and serum sodium. If only 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate is added to each liter of IV fluid, clinicians should be aware that the resultant fluid will be hypotonic if D5W is used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Replacement fluid therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> dosing can be accomplished intermittently either by the IV or oral route:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>50 mL of D5W containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> can be infused IV over 30 minutes every four or six hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> can also be given starting with two x 650 mg tablets, and increased up to five tablets every two to four hours.</p><p/><p>As with continuous administration of IV bicarbonate-containing fluid, the urine pH should be &ge;7.0 before the MTX infusion is begun, and urine pH must be monitored closely until serum MTX levels are below 0.1 microM to ensure that the urine is still adequately alkalinized.
