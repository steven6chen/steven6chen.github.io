This calculation is widely used to help differentiate prerenal disease (decreased renal perfusion) from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI, formerly called acute renal failure). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>As described below, there are a number of <strong>limitations to the use of FENa</strong> in patients with AKI. These limitations include the variability of the threshold FENa that is used to define prerenal disease, the presence of multiple causes of a low FENa other than prerenal disease, and errors associated with the use of measures of sodium excretion in the setting of renal salt wasting (as with diuretic therapy). Thus, the etiology of AKI should be based upon the <strong>totality of the presentation</strong> (history, clinical examination, urine microscopy, and, when appropriate, response to volume resuscitation), not just on the FENa. When diuretics may still be active and the FENa is not low, the fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of fractional excretion of sodium'</a> below and <a href=\"#H194656238\" class=\"local\">'Urea'</a> below.)</p><p>Although not yet in widespread clinical use, novel urinary and serum biomarkers to assess intrinsic tubular injury are being evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

However, there is some overlap since severe prerenal disease, particularly if accompanied by hypotension, is also a common cause of ATN. In addition to the laboratory tests, a careful history and physical examination are essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H914954245\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Causes of acute tubular necrosis'</a>.)</p><p>The fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) and other molecules, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> and uric acid, have also been evaluated for their utility in the distinction between prerenal disease and ATN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The FEUrea may be particularly helpful in patients who are being treated with diuretics, which can transiently raise the FENa above the value used to diagnose prerenal disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fractional excretion of other molecules'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FRACTIONAL EXCRETION OF SODIUM IN ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) can be measured in patients suspected of having AKI due to either prerenal disease or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A variety of studies have confirmed that the FENa more clearly differentiates between these two conditions than other laboratory tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/5,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8,9</a>]. As an example, in a prospective study of 87 patients with AKI (61 of whom had either prerenal disease or ATN), the FENa identified the correct diagnostic category in 86 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The urine sodium concentration, the urine-to-serum creatinine ratio, and the urine osmolality all had a much lower predictive value. While it has being shown to be comparatively better than other urinary indices at differentiating prerenal disease from ATN, FENa does not have enough accuracy to be used as a sole diagnostic test for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fractional excretion of sodium versus urine sodium concentration'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H26746798\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Other tests that may be helpful'</a>.)</p><p>In general, a FENa below 1 percent suggests prerenal disease, where the reabsorption of almost all of the filtered sodium represents an appropriate response to decreased renal perfusion. In comparison, a value between 1 and 2 percent may be seen with either disorder, while a value above 2 percent usually indicates ATN. However, a FENa below 1 percent is not diagnostic of prerenal disease, since it can be seen in a variety of other causes of AKI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H26746750\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Fractional excretion of sodium and urine sodium concentration'</a> and <a href=\"#H194655831\" class=\"local\">'Multiple causes of acute kidney injury with FENa less than 1 percent'</a> below.)</p><p>The above cut-off values <strong>apply only in patients with advanced AKI</strong>. The FENa values that define prerenal disease are lower in patients with less severe disease since the filtered sodium load is much higher, being as low as 0.1 percent in patients with normal kidney function. Another potential problem is that the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cannot be estimated from a single serum creatinine measurement, since the serum creatinine is not stable. (See <a href=\"#H713876789\" class=\"local\">'Fractional excretion of sodium varies with glomerular filtration rate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H791015361\" class=\"local\">'Single measurements of serum creatinine may be misleading'</a> below.)</p><p>The relatively high FENa in ATN can be due to one or both of the following factors: inappropriate sodium wasting due to tubular damage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an appropriate response of the remaining, well-preserved nephrons to volume expansion. Inappropriate sodium wasting is most likely to be important early in the disease, when nephrons that are still filtering have impaired tubular function. In comparison, volume expansion may be more important in patients with established ATN and normal tissue perfusion. At this time, most of the damaged nephrons may be nonfunctioning, with the urine output primarily coming from a relatively small number of well-preserved nephrons. In this setting, the maintenance of sodium balance requires a high FENa.</p><p>As an example, suppose a patient with established ATN has a GFR that has fallen from the normal level of 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> (125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> down to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span>. If the plasma water sodium concentration is 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> then the filtered sodium load will be 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> (20 x 150). If sodium intake is 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day,</span> then excretion of the ingested sodium will require a FENa of 2.5 percent (75 &divide; 3000).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractional excretion of sodium versus urine sodium concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The FENa is generally more accurate than the urine sodium concentration in differentiating prerenal disease from ATN because it directly measures sodium handling. In contrast, the urine sodium concentration is also affected by the rate of water reabsorption. As an example, a patient who is both water and sodium avid due to prerenal disease may, because of the low urine volume, have a relatively high urine sodium concentration of 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or more, despite having little sodium in the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of fractional excretion of sodium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are at least four important limitations to the use of FENa in establishing the cause of AKI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FENa criterion of less than 1 percent to diagnose prerenal disease applies <strong>only</strong> to patients with a marked reduction in GFR. (See <a href=\"#H713876789\" class=\"local\">'Fractional excretion of sodium varies with glomerular filtration rate'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single measurements of serum creatinine may not provide an accurate estimate of the GFR.

(See <a href=\"#H194655831\" class=\"local\">'Multiple causes of acute kidney injury with FENa less than 1 percent'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FENa may be above 1 percent when prerenal disease occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease or any cause of sodium wasting, such as diuretic therapy while the diuretic is still acting. (See <a href=\"#H1441649657\" class=\"local\">'Prerenal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10326913\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713876789\"><span class=\"h3\">Fractional excretion of sodium varies with glomerular filtration rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, the FENa is more reliable in patients with AKI than the urine sodium concentration since it does not vary with the urine volume. However, the FENa value of 1 percent that distinguishes prerenal disease from ATN applies only in patients with a <strong>marked reduction in GFR</strong>. In patients with less severe disease, the GFR and therefore the filtered sodium load are higher, and, at the same level of urinary sodium excretion, the FENa will be lower. Thus, there is <strong>no absolute FENa value that is always diagnostic of prerenal disease</strong>, which emphasizes the importance of using FENa in relation to the clinical context.</p><p>If, for example, the filtered sodium load is very low at 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> (GFR 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day,</span> which is approximately 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [normal 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> or 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min],</span> and the plasma water sodium concentration is 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> then a FENa below 1 percent is required to appropriately reduce sodium excretion below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day,</span> if prerenal disease were the only problem.</p><p>The results are quite different when the GFR is normal or only modestly reduced. At a normal GFR of 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> and plasma water sodium concentration of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> the filtered sodium load is 27,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span>. A FENa of 1 percent in this setting represents the excretion of 270 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day,</span> which is greater than the average sodium intake of 80 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span>. Thus, almost all individuals with a normal GFR have a FENa below 1 percent. To reduce sodium excretion to less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> in the presence of volume depletion requires a FENa below 0.1 percent. This value increases to 0.2 percent if the GFR is 50 percent of normal, 0.4 percent if the GFR is 25 percent of normal, and 1 percent if the GFR is 10 percent of normal.</p><p>These examples illustrate the difficulty of using the FENa to diagnose prerenal disease in settings other than severe AKI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H791015361\"><span class=\"h3\">Single measurements of serum creatinine may be misleading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The GFR <strong>cannot</strong> be estimated from a single serum creatinine measurement, since the serum creatinine is not stable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Suppose, for example, that a patient with septic shock is admitted to the hospital. The patient may be oliguric and have little or no renal function. However, if the disease duration is only a few hours, the serum creatinine will still be close to the patient&rsquo;s baseline value since there has not been time for creatinine to be retained. Thus, a serum creatinine of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> could be present in a patient with a normal baseline GFR who now has little or no glomerular filtration. The presence of AKI will be apparent from serial measurements of the serum creatinine, which can initially rise by as much as 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or more per day.</p><p>The same principle applies to patients with underlying chronic kidney disease. A patient with a baseline serum creatinine of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> may initially have the same value shortly after the onset of severe AKI even though the GFR is markedly reduced.

The ensuing natriuresis will raise the FENa, even in patients with prerenal disease. In older patients, the natriuresis may be delayed following diuretic administration.
