It happens when normal cells in the bone cartilage (the rubbery material where 2 bones meet) change into abnormal cells and grow out of control.</p><p>People can also have growths in their cartilage that are not cancer. Sometimes, a chondrosarcoma happens in a non-cancer growth that a person has had for a long time.</p><p>There are different types of chondrosarcomas. Most types grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325430\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a chondrosarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chondrosarcoma usually causes pain and swelling in the area of the cancer. The pain can come and go, but it usually gets worse over weeks to months. The pain is sometimes worse at night and with exercise. Some people might also see or feel a lump on their bone or in the tissues around the bone.</p><p>Some chondrosarcomas grow at the bottom of the skull bone. These can cause headaches and double vision.</p><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not a chondrosarcoma. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325445\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a chondrosarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will first order an X-ray of your bone.</p><p>If the X-ray shows that you might have a chondrosarcoma, you will have other tests. These will probably include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test, such as an MRI or CT scan, of the area &ndash; An imaging test creates pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy &ndash; This is a procedure in which a doctor removes a sample from the area suspected to have cancer. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325460\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the type of chondrosarcoma you have, its stage, and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325475\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a chondrosarcoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chondrosarcoma is usually treated with surgery. The type of surgery you have depends on where your cancer is and how big it is. Most people have surgery to cut out the cancer as well as some healthy tissue around the cancer. Depending on the type of surgery, the doctor might need to &quot;rebuild&quot; part of the bone after surgery.</p><p>In some cases, instead of cutting out the cancer, the doctor can do a type of surgery that involves using a tool to scrape away the cancer.</p><p>Doctors don't usually use radiation therapy to treat a chondrosarcoma. But if your doctor can't safely remove all of the cancer with surgery, he or she might treat you with radiation therapy. This involves getting high doses of X-rays (radiation) aimed at your cancer to kill the cancer cells</p><p>Although rare, a few types of chondrosarcomas grow quickly and spread easily to other parts of the body. Doctors usually treat these chondrosarcomas with surgery plus chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325490\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests can include exams, blood tests, chest X-rays, and imaging tests.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your chondrosarcoma has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325505\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my chondrosarcoma comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your chondrosarcoma comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325520\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for a chondrosarcoma involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5325535\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
