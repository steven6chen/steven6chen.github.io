General overviews of wrist pain and carpal fractures, as well as topics devoted to other specific carpal fractures in adults, are presented separately.

However, fractures of the pisiform bone occur less often than fractures of the scaphoid, lunate, or triquetrum, and account for only one to three percent of osseous injuries involving the carpal bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The estimated incidence of pisiform fractures ranges from 1 in 100 to 1 in 460 of all carpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They may occur in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], or be concomitant with other wrist injuries, especially distal radial fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pisiform is a sesamoid bone contained within the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70211 \">image 1</a>). Ossification occurs between 7 and 10 years of age, and is complete by age 12. It is the last carpus to completely ossify. Segmentation may be present before age 12 and should not be confused with fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The pisiform is easily palpable on the volar surface of the wrist directly proximal to the fifth (little finger) metacarpal at the distal wrist crease. Ligamentous attachments travel from the pisiform to the triquetrum, hamate and fifth metacarpal, while the abductor digiti minimi originates at the pisiform. The pisiform marks the ulnar border of Guyon's canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57601 \">figure 1</a>). With pisiform fracture there can be concomitant injury to the ulnar nerve, which traverses the canal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most commonly, the pisiform is injured by a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in extension, or when the heel of the hand is used to strike an object. Impact with the handle of a baseball bat, golf club, or racquet while swinging may also produce this injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These various compressive mechanisms can produce transverse, parasagittal, or comminuted fractures.</p><p>When the wrist is forcefully extended against resistance, the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon can rupture or cause an avulsion fracture at the distal aspect of the pisiform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This might occur when a heavy object falls and a person attempts to catch it with their hand palm up and wrist flexed, leading to a forceful eccentric contraction of the FCU. Repetitive sub-fracture blows, such as palm strikes in martial arts, may also lead to chondral injury of the pisotriquetral joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an isolated pisiform fracture generally present with focal pain and mild swelling at the palmar-ulnar aspect of the wrist. Concomitant ulnar nerve injury may cause fifth (little) and fourth (ring) finger numbness and intrinsic hand muscle weakness (weakness of finger spreading and little finger flexion and abduction).</p><p>On examination, tenderness is present directly over the pisiform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107905 \">picture 1</a>) and over the hypothenar eminence generally. Active wrist flexion and ulnar deviation (actions of the flexor carpi ulnaris) will likely be painful and somewhat limited. The ulnar nerve should be examined carefully for sensory or motor deficits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57601 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulnar-neuropathy-at-the-elbow-and-wrist#H87963063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and wrist&quot;, section on 'Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist'</a>.)</p><p>Ulnar nerve damage near Guyon's canal&mdash;in contrast to a more proximal ulnar neuropathy&mdash;causes reduced flexion strength of the little finger at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, but normal strength at the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints. Such injury causes reduced sensation in the fourth and fifth digits, but sensation of the proximal ulnar palm remains intact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1394776599\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard wrist radiographs (anterior posterior [AP], lateral, and reverse oblique views) should be obtained to evaluate for pisiform fractures and other carpal injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83269\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83269 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F85830\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85830 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70211 \">image 1</a>). The AP view may show a longitudinal (sagittal), transverse, or comminuted fracture. If not visible on standard films, the pisiform can be visualized with a carpal tunnel view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81015\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81015 \">image 4</a>), or a lateral wrist view obtained with 20 to 30 degrees of supination (reverse oblique) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107984\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107984 \">picture 2</a>). However, as the sensitivity of plain radiographs for detecting pisiform fractures is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>], a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be obtained if necessary when a fracture is not visible but clinical suspicion remains high. CT is useful for evaluating possible fracture or dislocation, while MRI has value in detecting both acute and chronic bony and soft tissue injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1435473870\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pisiform fracture may be made by positive radiography in conjunction with suggestive history and examination findings. However, as the sensitivity of plain radiographs poor, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be needed should a definitive diagnosis be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89394965\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnoses that may coincide or be confused with a pisiform fracture include those described below. The differential diagnosis for acute wrist pain is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2221549693\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture of other carpal bones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulnar sided wrist pain following trauma may be due to a fracture of the hamate, triquetrum, lunate, capitate, or any combination of these bones. Tenderness may be diffuse at the ulnar aspect of the wrist. Diagnostic imaging to identify such fractures should include standard and carpal tunnel wrist views, and advanced imaging may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2200350422\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture-dislocations of carpal bones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These potentially catastrophic injuries may be sustained from trauma, generally involving significant force, and must be diagnosed quickly to avoid possible neurovascular injury and osteoarthritis. Pisotriquetral dislocation or subluxation can masquerade as a pisiform injury. Examination often but not always reveals wrist deformity; definitive diagnosis is made with radiographs. Depending upon the extent of injury, immediate or urgent orthopedic consultation is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain#H26912264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Perilunate and lunate dislocations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3966375794\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal radius fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal radius fractures are the most common in the wrist. If a pisiform fractures is seen, a careful search for concomitant radial injury should be undertaken. Tenderness over the radius is typical, often accompanied by ecchymosis and deformity. Diagnosis is confirmed with radiographs, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396866068\"><span class=\"h2\">Wrist sprain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of fracture or dislocation, sprain of any of the many wrist ligaments and capsule is likely after acute trauma. Examination typically reveals wrist tenderness and often swelling, but plain radiographs are negative. Advanced imaging may be needed to definitively rule out a fracture. Treatment involves a period of immobilization and rehabilitation once healing is complete. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain#H3002805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Wrist sprain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1787236253\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothenar hammer syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetitive stress injury to the hypothenar eminence from biking, handball, martial arts, and other activities can lead to chronic injury to the ulnar artery in the region of Guyon's canal. Such chronic stress results in arterial constriction and thickening, and possibly thrombosis or aneurysm. Symptoms can include pain in the palm or ulnar digits and cold intolerance. The Allen test may show absent or delayed filling from the ulnar artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-techniques-for-upper-extremity-revascularization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular techniques for upper extremity revascularization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2948184547\"><span class=\"h2\">Pisotriquetral osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pisiform-related pain may be caused by pisotriquetral chondromalacia or osteoarthritis. A careful history reveals pre-injury pain at this location, but acute injury could cause a significant increase in pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2692171207\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pisiform is a sesamoid within the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon, and overuse can lead to tendonitis or tendinopathy. These conditions present with focal volar and ulnar sided wrist pain reproduced with wrist flexion and ulnar deviation. The diagnosis is clinical, but MRI may be helpful to rule out concurrent pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A widely displaced or comminuted fracture, or one associated with decreased flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) function, in a person desiring a quick return to work or sport is best treated with resection of the pisiform, and surgical referral is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. If symptomatic nonunion or malunion develop after appropriate conservative care, or if there is symptomatic post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the pisotriquetral joint, referral for surgical excision is warranted. Patients with associated ulnar neuropathy that fails to improve with 12 weeks of observation may be referred for possible surgical exploration of Guyon's canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Referral may be necessary for patients with concomitant injuries that warrant treatment by a specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated, nondisplaced pisiform fractures generally heal well when treated with immobilization for four to six weeks, typically in a short arm cast placed in 30 degrees of flexion with slight ulnar deviation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Motion at the metacarpophalangeal joints should not be restricted by the cast to prevent the development of joint stiffness. If swelling is marked or there is concern that swelling may progress, pisiform fractures can be immobilized initially in a volar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65696\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65696 \">figure 2</a>) or dorsal splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107942\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107942 \">figure 3</a>). If swelling is minimal or absent, definitive immobilization with a cast is appropriate. When a splint is used initially, it should be replaced with a cast at the first follow-up visit, generally five to seven days after the injury was sustained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The integrity of the short arm cast should be assessed after about three weeks or as needed for symptoms of poor cast fit. Biweekly cast checks may be prudent in highly active patients. After four to six weeks, the cast should be removed. Healing should be confirmed clinically by the absence of point tenderness or pain with resisted wrist flexion. Repeat imaging studies are unnecessary if the patient is healed clinically. If tenderness persists after six weeks of immobilization, referral should be made for possible surgical management. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p>After four to six weeks of casting, the wrist will have lost strength and mobility. Depending on the clinical circumstances, formal physical therapy or a home exercise program can be used to help the patient regain full function. The patient can stop the program once full mobility and strength are regained.</p><p>A basic home exercise program might consist of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform passive stretches twice daily, holding each stretch for 30 seconds. Stretch the wrist in flexion, extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation. The hand and wrist can be soaked in very warm water for 5 minutes prior to stretching to facilitate motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform motion and strength exercises after stretching. Exercises should include active wrist circles 10 times in each direction, followed by two sets of 15 repetitions using appropriate resistance (eg, elastic band, dumbbell) for each of the following: wrist flexion, wrist extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation.</p><p/><p>The patient's pain, motion and function should be assessed about two weeks after cast removal. Those who are having persistent, significant pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional impairment may benefit from a referral to physical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1982111025\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The great majority of isolated pisiform fractures heal uneventfully. Malunion and nonunion are rare complications. Post-traumatic pisotriquetral osteoarthritis may be a late sequela [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Should any of these three complications develop, they are treated by excising the pisiform. Ulnar nerve injury can occur from the initial trauma or from chronic irritation by fracture fragments. Malunion of a transverse fracture may lead to chronic dysfunction of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activities, including sports, can be resumed with cast protection as soon as the acute pain subsides. Baseball, golf, and racquet sports, or heavy labor involving wrist flexion, are not advised during cast treatment. After casting, return to these activities is permitted once the patient has achieved full wrist range of motion and at least 80 percent strength in all wrist planes of motion, compared to the uninjured side. This may occur one to three weeks after cast removal, but additional time may be needed in some cases.</p><p>In the rare case of a nonunion, an athlete can continue to play, with the wrist protected from contusion as desired, until excision can be performed at the end of the season. After pisiform excision, athletes can return to play typically within four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pisiform-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pisiform is a sesamoid bone contained within the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70211 \">image 1</a>). Pisiform fractures are uncommon and often uncomplicated. However, concomitant injury, such as distal radius fracture, can occur, particularly when the mechanism involves substantial force. (See <a href=\"#H3886190135\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most commonly, the pisiform is injured by a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in extension, or when the heel of the hand is used to strike an object. Impact with the handle of a baseball bat, golf club, or racquet while swinging may produce this injury, as may a sudden, forceful eccentric contraction of the wrist. A common finding is focal pain and tenderness over the pisiform, which is relatively superficial and located proximal to the fifth metacarpal at the distal palmar crease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107905 \">picture 1</a>). Active wrist flexion and ulnar deviation (actions of the flexor carpi ulnaris) will likely be painful and somewhat limited. The ulnar nerve should be examined carefully for sensory or motor deficits.

Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used if plain radiograph is not diagnostic, but clinical concern persists and a definitive diagnosis is required. (See <a href=\"#H1394776599\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for pisiform fracture includes fracture of other carpal bones, fracture-dislocation of carpal bones, and distal radius fracture.
