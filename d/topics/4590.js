When mucus has blood in it, it can have streaks of blood, or the mucus can turn red or pink. The term doctors use for coughing up blood is &quot;hemoptysis.&quot; Coughing up blood can happen in adults and older children, but it is uncommon in young children.</p><p>When a person coughs up blood, it usually means the blood is coming from their airways or lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 1</a>). In other cases, blood from the nose, mouth, or stomach can drip into the throat and be coughed up. People can often feel where the blood is coming from, but not always.</p><p>If a person coughs up a lot of blood, doctors call it &quot;massive hemoptysis.&quot; This can be a medical emergency. This article discusses coughing up blood that is not a medical emergency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81822462\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes people to cough up blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, there are many causes of coughing up blood, but the most common causes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchitis &ndash; Bronchitis means inflammation of the bronchi. The bronchi are the tubes that carry air into the lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 1</a>). There are 2 types of bronchitis. &quot;Acute&quot; bronchitis is an infection of the bronchi. &quot;Chronic&quot; bronchitis is a condition in which the bronchi get damaged, for example by cigarette smoking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections of the lungs, such as pneumonia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiectasis &ndash; This is a condition in which the airways are damaged and get infected easily. It has different causes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer that affects the bronchi or airways</p><p/><p>In children, the most common causes of coughing up blood are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection of the bronchi or lungs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having an object or piece of food stuck in the airway. The object might be stuck for days or weeks before a child starts coughing up blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiectasis &ndash; In children, this is usually caused by &quot;cystic fibrosis,&quot; a condition some children are born with. Cystic fibrosis causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs, which leads to frequent lung infections.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81822477\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Any time you or your child coughs up blood or mucus mixed with blood, call the doctor or nurse right away.</p><p>Let the doctor or nurse know if you remember seeing your child choke on something, even if it was days or weeks ago.</p><p>If you cough up a very large amount of blood (about 1 cup or more), or have trouble breathing, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81822492\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. Based on your symptoms and other factors, he or she might do tests. These tests can help your doctor or nurse find out why you're bleeding and where the bleeding is coming from.</p><p>Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests &ndash; These might include tests of your blood or a sample of the mucus you cough up.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopy &ndash; This is a procedure in which a doctor uses a thin tube (called a &quot;bronchoscope&quot;) to look inside your airways.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan &ndash; This is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of your body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81822509\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to stop coughing up blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you smoke cigarettes, the most helpful thing you can do is stop smoking. If you take a medicine that keeps blood clots from forming (a &quot;blood thinning&quot; or &quot;anti-clotting&quot; medicine), let your doctor or nurse know. He or she might change your dose.</p><p>For teenagers and adults who have small streaks of blood in their mucus, a doctor might suggest trying an over-the-counter cough medicine to control the cough. But do <strong>not</strong> give any cough or cold medicines to young children. These medicines are unlikely to help and can have serious side effects in young children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81822524\"><span class=\"h1\">How is coughing up blood treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms are mild and you have had a normal chest X-ray, you might not need treatment.</p><p>If you do need treatment, your doctor will treat the condition that's causing you to cough up blood. He or she can also help stop the bleeding by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribing a cough medicine to keep you from coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribing an antibiotic if you have bronchiectasis or an infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing a procedure during bronchoscopy to stop the bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81822539\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute bronchitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lung cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cystic fibrosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whooping-cough-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whooping cough (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiectasis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bronchiectasis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiectasis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bronchiectasis in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-cough-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic cough in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Flexible bronchoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
