HBV persists in the body of all patients with infection, even those with evidence of serological recovery. Thus, individuals with a history of HBV infection who receive immunosuppressive therapy are at risk for HBV reactivation and a flare of their HBV disease. This can result in increased serum aminotransferase levels, fulminant hepatic failure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, reactivation of HBV can lead to an interruption of immunosuppressive therapy (eg, chemotherapy), delaying treatment of the underlying disease.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prevention of HBV reactivation among those receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

HBV DNA level increases while receiving immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy. When the immune system recovers, for example, between cycles of chemotherapy, liver cell injury and necrosis can result from immune-mediated damage to infected hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109567\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining if a flare is due to HBV reactivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a flare secondary to HBV reactivation should have an increase in the ALT level that is consistent with a flare <strong>and</strong> evidence of HBV reactivation.

Thus, the serum HBV DNA may be low or undetectable when a patient with a flare is being evaluated; in this situation, it may be hard to confirm that HBV reactivation is the cause. Severe flares may also be accompanied by an increase in the IgM hepatitis B core antibody (IgM anti-HBc) titer, leading to misdiagnosis of acute HBV in patients who are not previously known to be HBsAg-positive.

Similar to patients with HBV reactivation due to immunosuppressive therapy, such patients often have an elevation in serum HBV DNA. Thus, patients who are HBeAg-positive at baseline should have their HBeAg repeated in the setting of a flare to determine if the increased ALT levels are associated with HBeAg clearance.
