Interestingly, allergic reactions have not been reported to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> itself but have been described to several other NSAIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-challenge-and-desensitization-protocols-for-nsaid-reactions/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 5</strong> &ndash; Allergic reactions (usually urticaria, pruritus, or angioedema) to a single NSAID.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 6</strong> &ndash; Anaphylaxis (ie, a more severe allergic reaction involving multiple organ systems) to a single NSAID.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9673464\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral to an allergy specialist with experience in drug allergy should be considered for patients who had severe reactions in the past and for those who would benefit from being able to take other NSAIDs if it were safe to do so. NSAID reactions are challenging to diagnose and manage for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some NSAID reactions can be severe or life-threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAID reactions can be challenging to classify based on history alone because the signs and symptoms of the various types of reactions may be overlapping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients have sometimes avoided all NSAIDs since the initial reaction, so it is not possible to determine if the symptoms are elicited by one or multiple agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients develop NSAID sensitivity at some point after initially tolerating these drugs, so the history of having tolerated a different NSAID prior to the first reaction does not mean that the patient would tolerate that agent again in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL ISSUES IN NSAID CHALLENGE AND DESENSITIZATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no in vitro assays or skin tests available to diagnose NSAID reactions. Therefore, a provocative challenge is the only means of obtaining a definitive diagnosis of current sensitivity if there is a legitimate medical need for future NSAID therapy. Challenge protocols involve cautiously administering gradually increasing doses of an NSAID, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, in an appropriately monitored medical setting. These procedures are also used to desensitize patients to NSAIDs in some situations.</p><p>Drug challenges are not without risk. Therefore, the benefits of the information gathered from the challenge must be weighed against the risks for each patient individually. The following are general guidelines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performing an NSAID challenge simply to determine if a person with a suggestive history is sensitive to an NSAID is not recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, if a patient has a medical indication for NSAID therapy, (eg, cardiovascular risk factors, confirmed coronary heart disease, or a chronic inflammatory condition, such as arthritis), it is usually appropriate to determine the specific type of reaction present. The information can then be used to determine what other NSAIDs the patient may safely take.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1956025721\"><span class=\"h2\">Indication for desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with NSAID reactions can sometimes be desensitized to an NSAID, which is accomplished by continuing the challenge procedure. Following desensitization, the patient must continue to take the NSAID in question daily to maintain the desensitized state. Two common indications for desensitization are the need for daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in patients with cardiovascular disease and the need for daily NSAIDs in patients with rheumatologic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any concurrent cardiopulmonary conditions should be under optimal control before a patient is challenged or desensitized. In patients with asthma, it is our practice to proceed with these procedures only if the prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is &ge;70 percent of the patient's best and &ge;1.5 liters. However, if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> desensitization is needed urgently (eg, after a cardiovascular event or procedure), systemic glucocorticoids can be given to rapidly control asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-of-aspirin-to-patients-with-aspirin-hypersensitivity-requiring-cardiovascular-interventions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction of aspirin to patients with aspirin hypersensitivity requiring cardiovascular interventions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with past NSAID reactions that involved possible anaphylaxis should not be on any medications that may increase the likelihood of anaphylaxis or interfere with treatment of anaphylaxis, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, although there may be individual exceptions to this.</p><p>NSAIDs can cause other types of reactions that are not considered here. These include severe cutaneous reactions, such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Patients who have experienced such reactions should not receive the culprit drug again, and any form of re-exposure, including challenge and desensitization, is contraindicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1361264\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety issues</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAID challenges should only be performed by clinicians with the expertise to manage any resultant symptoms and in settings equipped with the necessary medications, equipment, and support staff. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease#H347427262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some patients, intravenous access should be obtained prior to challenge in case emergency medications or fluids are required. This is indicated in patients believed to be at risk for moderate-to-severe symptoms during the challenge procedure, in those with past anaphylaxis, and in those with significant underlying cardiopulmonary disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Informed consent should be obtained from all adult patients or from the guardians of children under 18 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9673536\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate setting is determined by the historical features of past reactions and the clinician's knowledge about what types of reactions are in the differential diagnosis. In most cases, these protocols may be safely performed in specially equipped outpatient allergy clinics, while in other cases, admission to the hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) is indicated. Oral challenges in patients with previous anaphylaxis should be performed in an ICU or in an area where ICU transfer is readily available, although severe reactions are generally avoidable. The decision about where to perform challenges requires clinical judgment, and each case must be considered individually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1362865\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTOCOLS FOR ORAL CHALLENGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several basic oral challenge procedures, which differ in the starting dose and the time interval between doses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-challenge-and-desensitization-protocols-for-nsaid-reactions/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The choice of protocol depends upon the patient's past reaction. The clinician must categorize the patient's past reaction based upon reported symptoms and underlying disorders in order to choose the most appropriate protocol. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Reaction types'</a> above.)</p><p>The protocols described in this section were intended to be performed as elective procedures. A somewhat different approach is used for urgent desensitization after cardiac procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-of-aspirin-to-patients-with-aspirin-hypersensitivity-requiring-cardiovascular-interventions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction of aspirin to patients with aspirin hypersensitivity requiring cardiovascular interventions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1362897\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of NSAID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the author's institution and many others, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is the drug most often utilized in oral challenges. There is more experience with aspirin than any other NSAID, and aspirin has the additional advantage of not having been implicated in any confirmed cases of anaphylaxis. The few instances in which we perform challenges with NSAIDs other than aspirin are pointed out in the discussions below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1362904\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of placebo doses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not usually include placebos when a challenge is performed solely for the purposes of patient management. However, there are some situations in which the use of placebo doses is clinically useful. As an example, placebo doses are helpful in the evaluation of the patient who is suspected of not having sensitivity to NSAIDs at all, in whom challenge is indicated to prove that the patient tolerates NSAIDs. We sometimes give such patients an initial dose of placebo and also end the challenge with one or more placebo doses (so that the patient receives placebo when expecting the largest dose of the day) with one or more placebo doses in between. Informed consent should be obtained for inclusion of placebos.</p><p>In contrast, placebo doses are essential in research studies in which challenge is performed for the purposes of confirming the diagnosis. Many protocols include an initial day in which only placebos are administered to control for nonspecific changes in pulmonary function that some patients demonstrate in a challenge environment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1361315\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF REACTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1363033\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who experienced rhinorrhea or bronchospasm (often with nasal and ocular symptoms) following exposure to an NSAID most often have type 1 pseudoallergy. If the patient develops cutaneous symptoms (urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema or other cutaneous findings) during NSAID reactions, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> may have type 4 pseudoallergy. Patients with types 1 and 4 pseudoallergy have underlying asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, although the polyposis may not have been detected unless the patient has undergone evaluation for <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> sinus disease. The combination of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and respiratory reactions to NSAIDs is called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). It is important to recognize patients with AERD because they have potentially severe reactions to NSAIDs, and if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge is attempted, it must be done with appropriate safeguards in place (discussed below). AERD is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, a non-AERD patient with past bronchospasm following NSAID exposure has immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated anaphylaxis to that NSAID (type 6, allergic reaction). This should be suspected if the patient had a severe reaction to a single agent in the past and does not have a history of asthma or sinus disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9674005\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 1 (respiratory reactions to multiple NSAIDs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common reason for performing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge in a patient with AERD is to determine if the patient is sensitive to aspirin and therefore might benefit from daily aspirin therapy. In most cases, patients are premedicated with antileukotriene agents prior to undergoing aspirin challenges to reduce or eliminate the potentially severe pulmonary symptoms that can occur during challenge. A more detailed discussion of challenge and desensitization in patients with AERD is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: NSAID challenge and desensitization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with type 1 pseudoallergy can undergo the oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge described in row 1 of the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610 \">table 2</a>), following premedication with a leukotriene-modifying drug (LTMD). The starting dose is 40.5 mg, and this is doubled at intervals of three hours until the patient reacts or the desired therapeutic dose is reached.</p><p>If the patient does not react, then <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> either does not have NSAID allergy or pseudoallergy or <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> reaction requires higher doses to elicit. Most patients with type 1 pseudoallergy react to between 60 and 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, so if the final dose was only 81 mg, it is possible that it was below the dose needed to provoke a reaction. However, if the patient only requires low doses for therapy, then <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> can safely continue on 81 mg daily, although <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> should not take higher doses or other NSAIDs other than aspirin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9674280\"><span class=\"h4\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAID desensitization is a process of inducing tolerance to NSAIDs in a patient with pseudoallergic reactions. Desensitization is essentially a continuation of the challenge procedure until the patient reaches the desired dose without reacting further to the drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610 \">table 2</a>). <strong>Desensitization to </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a><strong> is nearly always successful in patients with type 1 pseudoallergy.</strong> Following desensitization, aspirin or another NSAID must be taken daily, since tolerance is lost if exposure is interrupted. This is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: NSAID challenge and desensitization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4537770\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 4 (respiratory and cutaneous symptoms to multiple NSAIDs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with type 4 pseudoallergy can undergo the oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge described in row 1 of the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610 \">table 2</a>), following premedication with a LTMD. The starting dose is 40.5 mg, and this is doubled at intervals of three hours, until the patient reacts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215626\"><span class=\"h4\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with type 4 pseudoallergic reactions generally can be desensitized. However, the process may be prolonged, and the patient may react at several different <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> doses. It is our approach to premedicate with a nonsedating oral antihistamine and a LTMD, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>. If a reaction occurs, we administer additional antihistamines, wait for the symptoms to subside, repeat the provoking dose, and continue the desensitization process. This process can take hours to days. The interval between doses can be extended by several hours (not to exceed 48 hours), if needed, to allow symptoms to resolve before continuing. Systemic glucocorticoids may be necessary for resistant cases. When the desired dose is reached without symptoms, the patient is desensitized. Once desensitized, the antihistamine and LTMD can be discontinued (tapering the dose or discontinuing gradually is not necessary). Although studies of desensitization for type 4 pseudoallergic reactions are lacking, it is the author's experience that nearly all patients can be desensitized if the clinician is persistent and makes judicious use of antihistamines and LTMDs as described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-challenge-and-desensitization-protocols-for-nsaid-reactions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9674018\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 6 (anaphylaxis to a single NSAID)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient had a past severe reaction to an NSAID that included respiratory symptoms and stopped taking NSAIDs at that point in time, it can be difficult to determine from the history if the patient had anaphylaxis to that single agent or if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> has a form of pseudoallergy.</p><p>For patients who have a history suggestive of single NSAID reactivity with anaphylaxis (type 6), performing an oral challenge to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a safe first step in the evaluation (row 4 of the table) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610 \">table 2</a>), since anaphylaxis to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> has not been described. A typical starting dose in these patients is 162 mg of aspirin, which is then doubled every three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-challenge-and-desensitization-protocols-for-nsaid-reactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient does not react to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, then <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> initial reaction was likely anaphylaxis to the specific NSAID in question.

In this situation, the starting dose should be much lower (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000<sup>th</sup></span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">1/100<sup>th</sup></span> of a dose), which is then increased 10-fold every three hours, since anaphylaxis to other NSAIDs has been reported. This scenario may arise if a patient has experienced possible anaphylaxis to a specific NSAID and needs NSAIDs for occasional use but cannot tolerate other chemically different groups of NSAIDs for various reasons. In this situation, an aspirin challenge would be performed first to exclude the possibility of pseudoallergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9674226\"><span class=\"h4\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization is <strong>rarely</strong> indicated for patients with type 6 reactions (ie, presumed IgE-mediated reactions to a single NSAID), because an array of different NSAIDs are available that can be used instead of the culprit drug. Patients with these types of reactions should avoid the causative agent and other NSAIDs in the same chemical group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 3</a>). NSAIDs that are structurally dissimilar to the drug that caused the initial reaction may be safely taken. It is the author's practice to give a full tablet of the alternative NSAID to demonstrate to the patient that it is tolerated and dispel any fears the patient may have about taking it. The first dose can be given under observation as a precaution. Other options for management are discussed separately.

Even when desensitization is initially successful, tolerance is often lost over time. In addition, if the patient's urticaria is more active for a period of time, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is likely to make it more difficult to control.</p><p>Despite this, patients with type 2 reactions who need <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for cardioprotection can sometimes tolerate 81 mg dose of aspirin daily without significant worsening of their symptoms. To determine this, we usually give one-half of a tablet (40.5 mg) initially, wait approximately three hours, and then give 81 mg. If the patient reacts to either step, we repeat that step at three-hour intervals until it is tolerated. The process can be interrupted overnight and continued for several days, if needed. A second option, if aspirin therapy is considered important for that patient, is to repeat the procedure on another day after the patient has been pretreated with H1 antihistamines (if the patient is already taking these for chronic urticaria, the dose can be increased), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-challenge-and-desensitization-protocols-for-nsaid-reactions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

It is our approach to begin the desensitization without premedications and then if the patient reacts, to initiate therapy with both a nonsedating oral antihistamine and an LTMD. If a reaction occurs, we administer additional antihistamines, wait for the symptoms to subside, repeat the provoking dose, and continue the desensitization process, continuing at three-hour intervals. Systemic glucocorticoids may be necessary for resistant cases. When the desired dose is reached without symptoms, the patient is desensitized. Once desensitized, the antihistamine and LTMD can be discontinued (tapering the dose or discontinuing gradually is not necessary). This approach has been successful in the author's experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-challenge-and-desensitization-protocols-for-nsaid-reactions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], although it has not been formally studied.</p><p>Other treatment options for these patients are reviewed separately.

NSAIDs that are structurally dissimilar to the drug that caused the initial reaction may be safely taken. It is the author's practice to simply give a full tablet of the alternative NSAID to demonstrate to the patient that it is tolerated and dispel any fears the patient may have about taking it. The first dose can be given under observation as a precaution, although this is not the practice in the author's clinic, where there is extensive experience with these reactions.

Challenge is usually indicated only in patients who have a legitimate medical need for future NSAID therapy. Simple avoidance of NSAIDs is a more practical option for patients who have no specific need for these mediations. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for challenge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization is most often performed to allow patients to take daily NSAID therapy.

The characteristics of the past NSAID reaction determine the protocol that should be used for challenge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58610 \">table 2</a>).

Challenge is expected to induce respiratory symptoms and premedication with leukotriene-modifying drugs (LTMDs) before oral challenge is recommended to minimize the severity of the symptoms, as reviewed in detail separately. Desensitization involves extending the diagnostic challenge procedure and is nearly always successful in patients with type 1 pseudoallergy.
