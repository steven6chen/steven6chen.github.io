The prevalence of hookworm infection is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Infection is rare in regions with less than 40 inches of rainfall annually.</p><p>There are two major species of hookworm that cause human infection: <em>Ancylostoma duodenale</em> (in Mediterranean countries, Iran, India, Pakistan, and the Far East) and <em>Necator americanus</em> (in North and South America, Central Africa, Indonesia, islands of the South Pacific, and parts of India).</p><p>In addition, a hookworm of dogs and cats, <em>Ancylostoma ceylanicum,</em> has been recognized as a widely prevalent cause of human zoonotic infections in India, Southeast Asia, tropical Australia, and some Melanesian Pacific Islands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND LIFE CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that over 500 million people are infected with hookworms worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Globally, hookworm infections have their major impact not by causing death but rather by contributing to morbidity especially due to anemia, including about 4 million daily adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of hookworm infection in rural areas of the southeastern United States in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century was high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Extensive control efforts diminished the prevalence within the United States; regions in the southeastern United States that have poor sanitation still are sites of hookworm infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2661484437\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and control'</a> below.)</p><p>Three conditions are important for transmission of hookworm infection: human fecal contamination of soil, favorable soil conditions for larval survival (moisture, warmth, shade), and contact of human skin with contaminated soil. Individuals who walk barefoot or with open footwear in fecally contaminated soil are at risk for infection; risk groups include native residents of endemic areas, tourists, and infantry troops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The hookworm life cycle begins with passage of eggs from an adult host into the stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61675 \">figure 1</a>). Hookworm eggs hatch in the soil to release rhabditiform larvae that mature into infective filariform larvae. Infection is transmitted by larval penetration into human skin; as few as three larvae are sufficient to produce infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. From the skin, larvae migrate into the blood vessels and are carried to the lungs. Approximately 8 to 21 days following infection, larvae penetrate into the pulmonary alveoli, ascend the bronchial tree to the pharynx, and are swallowed. In addition to percutaneous larval penetration (the principal mode of transmission), <em>A. duodenale</em> infection may also be transmitted by the oral route.</p><p>In the small intestine, the larvae mature into adult worms and attach to the intestinal wall with resultant blood loss. <em>A. duodenale</em> larvae may persist within tissues before returning to the intestine, with delay in egg laying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Following fertilization by adult male worms, gravid female adults lay eggs within the bowel. Eggs become detectable in feces about six to eight weeks following infection with <em>N. americanus</em>. Most adult worms are eliminated in one to two years, though infection can persist for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Issues related to the relationship between hookworm infection and allergic and autoimmune diseases are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=increasing-prevalence-of-asthma-and-allergic-rhinitis-and-the-role-of-environmental-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Increasing prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis and the role of environmental factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential manifestations reflect the four phases of hookworm infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermal penetration by infecting larvae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transpulmonary passage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute gastrointestinal symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic nutritional impairment</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermal penetration of the skin frequently produces a focal pruritic maculopapular eruption at the site of larval penetration (termed &quot;ground itch&quot;). Less often, serpiginous tracks of intracutaneous larval migration can be seen; this is similar to cutaneous larva migrans, which is typically caused by the infective larvae of the animal hookworms. Ground itch generally occurs between the toes and usually resolves within a few days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-lesions-in-the-returning-traveler\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin lesions in the returning traveler&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Transpulmonary passage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transpulmonary passage is usually asymptomatic. A mild cough and pharyngeal irritation may occur during larval migration in the airways, though eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates (such as those seen in the setting of <em>Ascaris</em> pulmonary involvement) are rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascariasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascariasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary symptoms attributable to hookworm have not been observed in experimentally infected volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage in these individuals has demonstrated only erythema of the bronchial mucosa without prominent eosinophilia in lavage fluids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may experience gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of larval migration to the small intestine. Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, midepigastric pain (usually with postprandial accentuation), and increased flatulence have been observed in individuals with naturally acquired infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and in experimentally infected volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Initial infections may be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms more frequently than subsequent infections. In one individual who was experimentally infected on four occasions, gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea were marked with the first infection, mild after the second, and absent after the third and fourth infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In those with heavy infections, especially in endemic regions, hookworm infections may cause overt gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Gastrointestinal symptoms improve following treatment of hookworm infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic nutritional impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major impact of hookworm infection is on nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This is particularly important in endemic areas where children and pregnant women may have limited access to adequate nourishment. In addition, maternal hookworm infection is associated with low birthweight.</p><p>Hookworms cause blood loss during attachment to the intestinal mucosa by lacerating capillaries and ingesting extravasated blood. This process is facilitated by the production of anticoagulant peptides that inhibit activated factor X and factor <span class=\"nowrap\">VIIa/tissue</span> factor complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and inhibit platelet activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Each <em>N. americanus</em> and <em>A. duodenale </em>worm consumes about 0.3 mL and 0.5 mL of blood per day, respectively. The daily losses of blood, iron, and albumin can lead to anemia and contribute to impaired nutrition, especially in patients with heavy infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clues to the presence of hookworm infection include clinical manifestations as described above, together with history of skin exposure to potentially contaminated soil <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> otherwise unexplained blood eosinophilia.</p><p>The diagnosis may be established by stool examination. Molecular diagnostic tests can differentially speciate infecting hookworm species. There are no reliable serologic tests available.</p><p>In some cases hookworms may be detected endoscopically, attached to the gastric and small intestinal mucosal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stool examination for the eggs of <em>N. americanus</em>, <em>A. duodenale, </em>or <em>A. ceylanicum</em> is useful for detection of clinically significant hookworm infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51004\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51004 \">picture 1</a>). Fecal egg excretion becomes detectable about eight weeks after dermal penetration of <em>N. americanus</em> infection and up to 38 weeks after dermal penetration of <em>A. duodenale</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Stool examination is not helpful prior to established intestinal tract disease, including during early stages of dermal, pulmonary, or intestinal involvement.</p><p>The standard method of diagnosis is with the Kato Katz technique. Other techniques used include the simple sodium nitrate flotation technique (SNF), FLOTAC, and mini-FLOTAC. Microscopic methods of stool examination for detection of hookworm infection are relatively insensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], so serial examinations may be required. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests (including multiplex PCR assays, which can simultaneously detect hookworm, <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em>, and <em>Trichuris trichiura</em>) have been developed. PCR has superior sensitivity compared with microscopy but has limited commercial accessibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. A PCR assay of human stool can specifically detect <em>A. ceylanicum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The eggs of <em>N. americanus</em> and <em>A. duodenale </em>are morphologically indistinguishable. Speciation is not necessary for clinical purposes and is only possible if adult worms are detected in stool or at endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Eosinophilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otherwise unexplained eosinophilia may be a major clue to the presence of a parasitic infection. Eosinophilia has been attributed to persistent attachment of adult worms to the intestinal mucosa. Among 128 Indochinese refugees with eosinophilia, a diagnosis of intestinal parasitism was made in 95 percent of cases; hookworm and <em>Strongyloides </em>were the most common organisms (55 and 38 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In one study of immigrants and travelers with eosinophilia in Spain, the most commonly identified parasites were <em>Strongyloides</em> (34 percent), <em>Schistosoma</em> (11 percent), and hookworm (9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The degree of eosinophilia with hookworm infection is usually mild and varies during the course of the disease. Among experimentally infected volunteers, blood eosinophilia increased progressively after two to three weeks and peaked at five to nine weeks. Peak eosinophil counts ranged from 1350 to 3828 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In untreated infections, eosinophilia slowly diminishes in magnitude but can remain elevated for several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hookworm-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1073279078\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of hookworm depends on the stage of infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermal penetration &ndash; Cutaneous manifestations of hookworm infection can resemble cutaneous larva migrans (infection with the dog or cat hookworm, <em>Ancylostoma braziliense</em> or <em>Ancylostoma caninum</em>). Hookworm causes focal skin lesions at the site of larval dermal penetration. In rare cases, migration of hookworm larvae elicits a serpiginous migratory track; if so, this occurs shortly after dermal penetration. In contrast, larvae causing cutaneous larva migrans elicit more extensive migratory serpiginous lesions, which last more than a few days and may appear weeks to months following exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transpulmonary passage &ndash; Pulmonary manifestations due to hookworm infection can resemble pulmonary infection due to <em>A. lumbricoides</em> or <em>Strongyloides</em>. In some cases, sputum examination may demonstrate diagnostic larvae; otherwise, stool microscopy may be performed, although <em>Ascaris </em>stool eggs may not be detected until three to four weeks following infection.
