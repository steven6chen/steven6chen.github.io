Estimates run as high as 20 percent for difficult airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and approximately 1 percent for failed airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Difficulty in airway management is variably defined, and includes the need for excess lifting force, poor view of the vocal cords, multiple or prolonged attempts, multiple operators, and the use of multiple intubating devices.</p><p>A wide range of devices have been developed to aid in the management of the difficult airway. They incorporate a variety of fiberoptic, video, optical, and mechanical technologies to enable the operator to obtain a better view of the larynx and facilitate passage of an endotracheal tube (ETT) into the trachea. These devices are useful for management of the difficult or failed airway and for routine intubation.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the types of devices designed to facilitate management of difficult and failed airways. The overall approach to the management of such airways is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STYLETS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We define a stylet as a device loaded within the lumen of an endotracheal tube (ETT) in order to assist tracheal placement. A standard malleable metal stylet is inserted into an ETT to lend greater stiffness and thereby improve control. In contrast, specialized stylets facilitate intubation in situations of poor glottic exposure and if adapted with advanced optics, can provide a better view of the glottis than is obtained with direct laryngoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Endotracheal tube introducers (gum elastic bougie)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) is an effective and inexpensive adjunct to difficult airway management that is easy to use. We recommend that an ETI be readily available in every emergency department. The technique for using these devices and evidence of their effectiveness are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endotracheal tube introducers (gum elastic bougie) for emergency intubation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Lighted stylets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lighted stylet is a useful tool for difficult airway management, particularly in patients with an anterior airway. It is not useful in patients with distorted upper airway anatomy. The intubator must develop and maintain facility with the device.</p><p>A lighted stylet, such as the Trachlight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63169 \">picture 1</a>), relies on a bright light at the distal tip of the device to transilluminate the glottis through the soft tissues of the neck, thereby providing indirect visual confirmation of tracheal placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74936\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74936 \">picture 2</a>). Intubation using a lighted stylet does not depend on direct visualization of internal structures. Proper application relies largely upon recognizing midline (ie, tracheal) versus lateral (soft tissue) or esophageal placement of the device.</p><p>Observational studies support the use of lighted stylets in routine and difficult airway management; however, acquisition of skill with the technique requires 10 to 20 intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Inexperienced users have longer times to intubation and lower success rates compared with direct laryngoscopy (DL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/3-5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,7</a>]. With more experienced users, first pass intubation success rates using lighted stylets are as high as 93 percent and discrepancies with DL in the time needed for intubation diminish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/6,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-10</a>].</p><p>Advantages of lighted stylet intubation include utility in managing difficult anterior airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/6,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,11</a>], less risk of pharyngeal trauma compared with DL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>], the ability to intubate when the glottis cannot be adequately visualized by DL, and less cervical spine motion compared with DL or the Glidescope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Hemodynamic responses to lighted stylet intubation are similar or less than with DL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/10,11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,16,17</a>]. The lighted stylet can be used for nasotracheal intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>] and to aid placement of ETTs using an intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Lighted stylet intubation is not recommended in patients with abnormal or distorted upper airway anatomy, such as traumatic injuries, tumors, infections, or foreign bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The light of the Trachlight is bright enough for the transilluminated glow to be seen in ambient light, but room lights may need to be dimmed for the glow to show through thick subcutaneous tissue or deeply pigmented skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Optical stylets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optical stylets (OS) incorporate a fiberoptic or video viewing element into the distal end of a metal stylet. The stylet can be rigid, semirigid, or directable. The viewing element effectively moves the intubator's view from outside the mouth with direct laryngoscopy to the region just proximal to the glottis with an OS. The OS may be useful in some patients with a difficult airway. In the absence of obstructing debris, the OS can provide an improved view of the vocal cords and ensure passage of the endotracheal tube (ETT) into the trachea under direct visualization. Use of an OS may reduce cervical spine motion during intubation. </p><p>Like any nontraditional method of laryngoscopy, the OS requires skill acquisition and maintenance to be used effectively. To date, no clinical trials of OS devices for the management of difficult airways in the emergency department have been performed. Use of OS devices for airway management and supporting evidence are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H418683882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Optical stylets'</a>.)</p><p>The OS, although more expensive than a lighted stylet, is typically less expensive than other video and fiberoptic laryngoscopes. All OS devices have an eyepiece for viewing the glottis, and some can be connected to an external monitor for ease of use, teaching, or supervision. Several of these devices also have a side port to insufflate oxygen in order to prevent secretions from obscuring the fiberoptic tip of the stylet. Common examples of the OS include the Clarus Video System (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111574\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111574 \">picture 3</a>), Shikani Optical Stylet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55948\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55948 \">picture 4</a>), Bonfils Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63259\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63259 \">picture 5</a>), and the Levitan FPS Scope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111573\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111573 \">picture 6</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexible endoscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flexible endoscope (FE) is essentially a 60 cm long flexible and directable stylet that can be used for airway management in patients for whom difficult intubation is predicted and neuromuscular paralysis is best avoided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67231 \">figure 1</a>). Because of the time required and the patient preparation necessary, intubation using a FE is generally not performed in patients who require immediate establishment of an airway. If time allows for adequate patient preparation, the FE is an invaluable intubating device. FE for intubation is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among the devices used for difficult airway management, the FE has a unique set of characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FE can be used for either orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation. Nasotracheal use allows access to the vocal cords when mouth opening is limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FE can be used with adjunctive devices, such as specially designed oral airways, that improve intubation success.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More time is required to perform intubation using the FE. Patients must be cooperative (usually achieved by using sedation and topical anesthesia), breathing spontaneously, and adequately oxygenated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians must practice longer and more often to acquire and maintain facility with the FE compared with other airway devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cost of purchasing and maintaining a FE is higher than for most other devices.</p><p/><p>Despite these limitations to FE use for emergency airway management, a survey in 1999 found that 64 percent of academic EDs had an FE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Indications for FE use include a difficult airway due to limited mouth opening, oral obstructions from infection, hematoma, or angioedema, and upper airway anatomic abnormalities from masses, operations, trauma, or head and neck contractures.</p><p>Relative contraindications include copious secretions or blood and a rapidly worsening supraglottic obstruction, such as a foreign body, with imminent airway compromise.</p><p>Nasotracheal intubation with the FE offers some advantages, but some clinicians find it more difficult to perform than its oral counterpart because of the greater distances and angles to be negotiated. The nasal route is often better tolerated by the patient and eliminates the risk of the patient biting the endoscope and damaging the fiberoptic bundles. Passage of the scope and ETT through the nasopharynx can cause bleeding, which obscures visualization. Therefore, application of a vasoconstrictor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymetazoline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>, cocaine) prior to the procedure is important to minimize this risk.</p><p>We recommend that the intubator insert the well-lubricated endotracheal tube first, passing it through the naris and into the nasopharynx, and then insert the FE through the lumen of the tube. This eliminates the possibility that the operator will be unable to successfully pass the tube into and through the naris after the vocal cords are traversed by the FE. In addition, pre-loading the ETT into the nose provides a clean, smooth pathway for the FE to pass, making contamination with mucous and topical anesthetics less likely and passage easier. The ETT should only be pre-loaded just beyond the posterior nasopharynx. This increases the likelihood of obtaining an excellent view of the glottis when the FE emerges from the ETT. </p><p>A common pitfall is positioning the ETT too deep, which can impair visualization of the glottis, as the tip of the ETT may be at or below the level of the glottis, typically in a piriform sinus. If airway landmarks are lost, pull the FE back to the tip of the ETT, and then gradually withdraw the ETT until the glottis, tongue, or uvula is visualized, and then reattempt FE advancement.</p><p>If orotracheal intubation is desired, bite blocks are necessary to prevent the patient from biting the FE. Specialized airways (eg, Berman Breakaway Airway, Williams Airway, Ovassapian Airway) designed for use with the FE and shaped to direct the tip of the scope towards the glottis are available. FEs can also be placed through an extraglottic device (eg, LMA or I-gel) to facilitate endotracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While a complete tutorial of flexible endoscopes is beyond the scope of this review, there are a few technical points worth highlighting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognize that the procedure often requires 5 to 20 minutes. If the patient cannot tolerate such a delay, the technique should not be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay in the anatomic midline at all times during the procedure. Straying laterally often results in poor visualization and inability to pass the FE through the vocal cords.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The operator should keep the FE taut between both hands. If slack is present, rotation of the body of the FE will not translate into rotation of the tip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many of the smaller scopes used for intubation, suction through the working channel is ineffective at clearing the field of view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent insufflation of oxygen through the working channel can be useful to clear debris from the scope tip. However, prolonged insufflation can result in barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is difficulty passing the ETT off the FE and into the airway, the ETT tip is likely caught at the level of the arytenoids. Counter-clockwise rotation of the entire tube-scope apparatus will likely overcome the obstruction.</p><p/><p>Studies have shown that emergency clinicians performing FE intubations have a success rate between 56 and 99 percent, depending upon the operator's level of experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>].</p><p>Flexible endoscopes typically cost thousands of dollars (United States), and can be fragile and difficult to maintain in an ED environment. A single use, disposable alternative is available in the Ambu aScope. In this device, the disposable video scope and handle connect to a reusable video screen. No studies have been published that assess the aScope in emergency airway management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTRAGLOTTIC DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extraglottic airway devices are used to establish an airway for oxygenation and ventilation without entering the trachea. They are important tools for airway management and are used frequently in the prehospital environment, emergency department, operating room, and other settings. They can be primary airway devices, such as during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or rescue devices for failed airways. Common categories of extraglottic airway devices include supraglottic airways (eg, laryngeal mask airway) and retroglottic airways (eg, laryngeal tubes). A detailed review of the extraglottic airways commonly used for emergency airway management, include text and video clips demonstrating proper placement and use, is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANCED LARYNGOSCOPES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Video laryngoscopes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Video laryngoscopes (VLs) are rigid devices that allow indirect laryngoscopy, or visualization of the vocal cords and related airway structures without a direct line of sight. VLs are fundamentally retraction devices with built-in illumination and optical elements. Over the past few decades, use of VLs has expanded to the operating theater, emergency department, and prehospital setting. A number of different VLs are available, but these can be categorized according to common features, such as blade shape and the presence or absence of a tracheal tube guide. The use of VLs for emergency airway management is discussed below; the different types of VLs and their use in the operating theater are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1516195236\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence and use of video laryngoscopes in emergency settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few rigorous randomized trials have been performed to assess the performance of video laryngoscopes (VL) in emergency airway management. Nevertheless, based upon our clinical experience and available data, we believe these devices are highly effective and can help emergency clinicians and other emergency airway managers maximize first-pass intubation success in both routine and difficult airway scenarios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>Multiple controlled and prospective observational studies report that video laryngoscopes as a class provide superior views of the glottis compared with direct laryngoscopy (DL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/35-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-41</a>] and cause minimal movement of the cervical spine during intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/15,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,42-44</a>]. According to a meta-analysis of nine trials involving 2133 patients requiring tracheal intubation in the intensive care unit, video laryngoscopy reduced the rate of difficult intubation (odds ratio [OR] 0.29; 95% CI 0.20-0.44) and increased the rate of first-attempt success, a factor associated with reduced complication rates (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.35-3.16), compared to standard direct laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Subsequent studies report similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A retrospective study of 2677 tracheal intubations performed by emergency medicine residents reported a significantly lower rate of esophageal intubation when a VL was used (18 or 1895 attempts; 1%, 95% CI 0.6-1.5%) compared to DL (78 of 1530 attempts; 5.1%, 95% CI 4.1-6.3%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The use of VL devices for airway management in anesthesia is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, not all studies comparing VL with DL report important differences in clinically important outcomes, such as first pass success and complication rates (although some researchers speculate that this stems from insufficient familiarity or training with the VL). As an example, a randomized trial of critically ill patients requiring intubation performed at seven ICUs across France found that laryngoscopy performed using a VL (McGrath MAC) did not improve first-pass orotracheal intubation rates compared with DL using a standard MacIntosh laryngoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].&nbsp;While the authors also reported an association between intubation using VL and life threatening complications, these findings were based on unspecified, post-hoc analyses, and contradict the conclusions of multiple previous studies, and so remain of dubious validity. &#160;</p><p>One important message to take from the evidence is that video laryngoscopes are not created equal, but vary by design and adjunct features, such as size, the acuity of the blade curve, and whether a channel to guide tracheal tube placement is incorporated.&nbsp;As such, any assessment of trials of VL performance should pay specific attention to the type of video device used.&nbsp;Results of studies should not simply be combined without distinction under the label of &quot;video laryngoscope.&rdquo;</p><p>VLs are easy to use and build upon basic DL techniques, although some training and adjustments in technique are needed. Furthermore, unlike DL, video laryngoscopes provide the supervisor and trainee with an identical view of the glottis, allowing for improved teaching and troubleshooting.</p><p>VLs use fiberoptics or a micro video camera encased in a laryngoscope to provide a wide-angle view of the glottis. The optics are set back from the tip of the laryngoscope blade, minimizing interference from secretions. Devices with micro video cameras are less expensive and more durable than flexible fiberoptics, which use glass fiber. Examples of VLs include the GlideScope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111570 \">picture 7</a>), Pentax Airway Scope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85754 \">picture 8</a>), McGrath Video Laryngoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55142 \">picture 9</a>), and the Storz CMAC video laryngoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57154\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57154 \">picture 10</a>). Few studies have directly compared the performance of one video laryngoscope to another. One retrospective study of 463 intubations performed in the emergency department reported similar rates of first-pass and overall intubation success with the Glidescope and the CMAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The use of VLs varies, depending upon the configuration of the blade. The blade most often is inserted midline and no tongue sweep is required. With the Glidescope, once fully inserted, with the blade tip at the base of the tongue, the device is tilted slightly, rather than lifted, so that the tip of the blade is oriented directly towards the epiglottis. Only a slight lift, if any at all, is applied since the curve of the blade corresponds to the shape of the airway. The ETT stylet requires a 90 degree bend just proximal to the cuff in order to follow the shape of the blade into the glottis. In a randomized trial of surgical patients intubated using the Glidescope, a 90 degree angle improved the ease of intubation, but neither forward nor reverse orientation of ETT camber affected performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Once the ETT is seen entering the vocal cords, the stylet needs to be partially withdrawn to allow the ETT to advance into the trachea. This step can sometimes be challenging, and the manufacturer provides a custom-made rigid stylet to facilitate this action. According to a retrospective study of 473 emergency department (ED) intubations, use of the custom-made rigid stylet is associated with higher rates of successful intubation, both at the first attempt and overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, this is in contrast to an operating room report in which the Glidescope proprietary stylet and a standard malleable stylet were found to be equally effective when used by experienced anesthesiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Further research is needed to address the question of stylet use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3878643699\"><span class=\"h3\">Types of video laryngoscopes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Video laryngoscopes (VLs) are rigid devices that allow indirect laryngoscopy, or visualization of the vocal cords and related airway structures without a direct line of sight. A number of different VLs are manufactured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55142 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57154\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57154 \">picture 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111570 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111569\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111569 \">picture 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85754 \">picture 8</a>), but these can be categorized according to common features. The features and classification of VLs is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H1753778712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Optical laryngoscopes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optical laryngoscopes use lenses to provide a view of the anterior glottis not possible with direct laryngoscopy (DL). Although image quality is inferior to that of video laryngoscopes, optical laryngoscopes are an inexpensive, durable, and portable tool for difficult airway management. Two examples are the Truview laryngoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82250\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82250 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62179\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62179 \">picture 13</a>) and the Airtraq optical laryngoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72818 \">picture 14</a>).</p><p>The Truview EVO has an angled laryngoscope blade with an affixed eyepiece and oxygen insufflation port to keep the optical lens clear of secretions or blood. The eyepiece and lens assembly allows the intubator to see 42 degrees anterior to the axis of the blade, enabling visualization of the glottis with less lifting force and improved exposure compared with a Macintosh laryngoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>The Airtraq is a unique optical laryngoscope with an L-shape, similar to the blade of the Pentax AWS that allows glottic visualization with the head and neck in a neutral position. It is a single-use device, simply constructed and inexpensive. </p><p>A meta-analysis of 12 small randomized trials involving 1061 patients that compared the Airtraq to a standard Macintosh laryngoscope found that the Airtraq reduced the time required for intubation (-15 seconds, 95% CI -25- -4), increased first pass intubation success rates among novice airway managers (relative risk [RR] 1.25, CI 1.05-1.49), and reduced the incidence of esophageal intubation (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03-0.48) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Individual studies noted that use of the Airtraq led to reduced cervical spine motion and less change in heart rate compared with DL using a Macintosh laryngoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-59</a>].</p><p>The Airtraq has been used as a rescue device for difficult airways and in one small randomized controlled trial outperformed DL using a Macintosh laryngoscope in patients with preoperatively defined difficult airway features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

This is most often accomplished using either an &quot;open&quot; or a percutaneous technique. Cricothyrotomy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of airway devices have been developed that enable improved management of difficult airways compared with direct laryngoscopy. The full impact of these devices on the concept of the difficult and failed airway is yet to be fully defined. The following points about these devices bear mentioning:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraglottic devices establish an airway for oxygenation and ventilation without traversing the glottis, and are critical tools for the management of difficult and failed airways. The most commonly used extraglottic devices are the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA), Combitube, and laryngeal tubes. We recommend that clinicians responsible for airway management be familiar with at least one such device. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endotracheal tube introducer (ie, gum elastic bougie) is an effective, inexpensive, easy-to-use adjunct to difficult airway management. We recommend that these be available in every emergency department. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endotracheal-tube-introducers-gum-elastic-bougie-for-emergency-intubation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endotracheal tube introducers (gum elastic bougie) for emergency intubation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optical stylets (OS) incorporate a fiberoptic or video viewing element into the distal end of a metal stylet. The stylet can be rigid, semirigid, or directable. The viewing element effectively moves the intubator's view from outside the mouth to the tip of the OS and closer to the glottis, making it useful in patients with a difficult airway. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Optical stylets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The flexible endoscope (FE) is essentially a flexible and directable stylet that can be used for airway management when difficult intubation is predicted, time is available, and neuromuscular paralysis is best avoided. Intubation using a FE is generally not performed in patients who require immediate establishment of an airway. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Flexible endoscope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Video laryngoscopes are highly effective tools that can help maximize first-pass intubation success in both routine and difficult airway scenarios. Video laryngoscopes provide superior views of the glottis compared with direct laryngoscopy, and cause minimal movement of the cervical spine. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Video laryngoscopes'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Murphy, M, Walls, RM.
