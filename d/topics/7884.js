The incidence is greatest in children &lt;1 year (4 to 9 cases per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-children/abstract/5,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-10</a>].</p><p>The frequency with which GAS bacteremia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive GAS infection occurs in children has been evaluated in two single institution case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-children/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. In one study, which reviewed blood cultures over a 10-year period (1993 to 2002), GAS accounted for 3.3 percent of all positive blood cultures in children, and GAS bacteremia was noted in 13 per 1000 pediatric hospital admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another study, which evaluated invasive GAS infections in hospitalized children during a similar time period (1993 to 2001), the reported incidence ranged from 1 to 2.5 cases per 1000 hospital admissions per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Invasive GAS attack rates have been relatively stable in the United States since the mid-1990s. Approximately 100 to 200 pediatric cases were reported to the Active Bacterial Core (ABC) Surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year from 2010 to 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-children/abstract/7,9,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,12-15</a>]. While incidence rates at the national level have been stable, there may be regional variation. As an example, in population-based surveillance in Utah (which is not part of the ABC network), the incidence of invasive GAS in children &lt;18 years increased between 2002 and 2010 (from 3 to 14 cases per 100,000), in part due to an increase in cases of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of severe GAS infection increased between 1985 and 1994, predominantly from North America and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-children/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. The reason for the marked increase is not well defined.

It has been suggested that alterations in the distribution of M-types causing infection and an increasing prevalence of toxin-producing strains could be responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-a-streptococcal-streptococcus-pyogenes-bacteremia-in-children/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

The estimated incidence of GAS bacteremia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive infection in children is 2 to 3 cases per 100,000 per year. GAS bacteremia occurs in 1 to 13 per 1000 pediatric hospital admissions. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preceding varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection has been associated with invasive GAS infection, although widespread use of the VZV vaccine appears to prevent VZV-associated invasive GAS infection. Fever on or beyond the fourth day of the exanthem in children with VZV should prompt consideration of GAS bacteremia. Other predisposing factors for invasive GAS infection include: influenza infection; preceding skin disruption from minor trauma, burns, eczema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recent surgery; underlying immunocompromise; malignancy; and age less than one year. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of GAS bacteremia include those of the primary site of infection and of the bacteremia. High fever, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are common but nonspecific. The clinical course may be fulminant and severe organ dysfunction can occur. The majority of patients have a focal site of infection, most commonly involving the soft tissues. Patients without a focal source of infection tend to have less severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal management of a patient with GAS bacteremia includes prompt treatment with antibiotics, management of the complications of shock and organ dysfunction, and aggressive surgical debridement when appropriate. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) is not routinely warranted for treatment of GAS bacteremia, but may be reasonable for selected patients with severe and refractory shock. (See <a href=\"#H97183863\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome&quot;, section on 'Intravenous immune globulin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that GAS bacteremia in children be initiated with penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a> rather than penicillin or clindamycin alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
