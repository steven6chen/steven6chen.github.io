It's very important that you see your doctor or nurse for a &quot;pre-pregnancy check-up.&quot; Your doctor or nurse will ask you about things that could affect your pregnancy. For instance, he or she might ask about your diet, lifestyle, use of birth control, past pregnancies, medicines, and any diseases that you have or that run in your family.</p><p>There are several things that you and your doctor or nurse can do to make sure that your pregnancy is as healthy as possible. These things should be done <strong>before</strong> you try to get pregnant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss any medicines or herbal drugs you take and find out if you need to make changes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss whether you are up-to-date on your vaccines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start taking a multivitamin that has <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> (also called folate)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Know which foods you should avoid and which foods are best</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking drugs not prescribed for you by a doctor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understand the risks to you and your baby if:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>You have any medical conditions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are diseases that run in your family or your partner's family</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss whether there are any harmful substances in your home or work</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to reach a healthy weight</p><p/><p>Each of these issues is explained in more detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010288\"><span class=\"h1\">Ask if the medicines you take are safe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you take any medicines, supplements, or herbal drugs, ask your doctor if it is safe to keep taking them while you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Some medicines take a long time to leave your body completely, so it's important to plan ahead. In some cases, your doctor and nurse will want you to switch to different medicines that are safer for the baby. Your doctor and nurse might need to slowly get you off some medicines because it could harm you to stop them all of a sudden. This is especially important for women who take medicines to treat seizures, high blood pressure, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010295\"><span class=\"h1\">Check if you need any vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who want to get pregnant should be up-to-date on their vaccines. This includes vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio, chickenpox (also called varicella), and possibly hepatitis. Many women got these vaccines as children. Still, it is important to check that you have had all the right vaccines. Otherwise, you could get sick with the diseases the vaccines protect against, and that could cause problems for you or your baby. All women should also get a flu shot every year.</p><p>Some vaccines cannot be given during pregnancy or in the month before pregnancy. It's important to get these vaccines more than a month before you start trying to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010302\"><span class=\"h1\">Start taking a multivitamin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, take a &quot;prenatal&quot; multivitamin every day that has at least 400 micrograms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>. This helps prevent some birth defects. Start taking the multivitamin at least a month before you start trying to get pregnant. It's not enough to start taking vitamins when you find out you are pregnant. At that point, your baby has already formed many body parts that rely on folic acid and other vitamins to develop normally.</p><p>It is important not to take too much of any vitamin during pregnancy, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin A</a>. Show your doctor or nurse the vitamins you plan to take to make sure the doses are safe for you and your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010309\"><span class=\"h1\">Check your diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some foods are not safe for a woman who is pregnant or trying to get pregnant. If you are trying to get pregnant, do not eat raw or undercooked meat. Avoid eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish because they can have high levels of mercury. Check with your doctor or nurse about the safety of fish caught in local rivers and lakes. Limit the amount of caffeine you have by not drinking more than 1 or 2 cups of coffee each day. Tea and cola also contain caffeine, but usually not as much as coffee. Try to eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010316\"><span class=\"h1\">Stop smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking illegal drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you smoke, drink alcohol, or take drugs not prescribed for you by a doctor, now more than ever it is important that you stop. Using even small amounts of these substances from time to time during pregnancy could hurt your baby.</p><p>It's not enough to stop as soon as you find out you are pregnant. By then the baby has already begun to form and could get damaged by smoking, alcohol, or drugs. If you need help quitting, speak with your doctor or nurse. There are effective treatments that can help.</p><p>Your partner should also stop smoking and using illegal drugs. He should not drink too much alcohol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010323\"><span class=\"h1\">Ask about risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your doctor what the risks to you and your baby might be if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>You have any medical conditions</strong> &ndash; If you have a medical problem, it could cause problems for you or your baby during pregnancy. Women who have certain medical conditions should work with their doctor to get their conditions under control before they get pregnant. This includes women with diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, thyroid conditions, seizure disorders, HIV infection, and other problems. If these conditions are not well controlled, they can cause problems for a mother and her baby during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>You or your partner has a family history of a medical condition</strong> &ndash; If you or your partner has a history of a condition that could be passed on to your baby, you might need genetic counseling. Genetic counseling can help you find out what the chances are that your baby will have the condition. It will also help you sort out what your options might be if your baby does have problems. Examples of conditions that might call for genetic counseling include cystic fibrosis, mental retardation, and muscular dystrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010330\"><span class=\"h1\">Check your home and work for harmful substances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People often have chemicals or substances in their home or work that could hurt an unborn baby. Dealing with these substances can sometimes be complicated and time consuming, so it's important to plan ahead. For instance, people who live in homes built before 1978 often have lead paint on their walls or woodwork. Lead in chips or dust from this paint could harm a baby. Ask your doctor or nurse how to deal with this and other harmful substances you might have around you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010337\"><span class=\"h1\">Work on your weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who weigh too little or too much can have problems getting pregnant and problems during pregnancy. You should try to reach a healthy weight before you try to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13010493\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-during-pregnancy-for-women-with-type-1-or-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Care during pregnancy for women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lead-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lead poisoning (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-over-the-counter-medicines-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking over-the-counter medicines during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) during pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-and-drug-use-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol and drug use in pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-during-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccination during pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-during-pregnancy-for-women-with-type-1-or-2-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Care during pregnancy for women with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
