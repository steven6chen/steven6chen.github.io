The patella is displaced from the trochlear groove. Intra-articular dislocations with lodging of the patella within the joint space may be superior, inferior, or vertical. (See <a href=\"#H5306906\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of injury'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patellar subluxation</strong> &ndash; Patellar subluxation describes excessive lateral movement of the patella and may occur as a result of trauma or in patients with laxity. The patella still tracks within the trochlear groove but may cause discomfort and a feeling of instability. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Knee dislocation</strong> &ndash; As opposed to patellar dislocations, knee (tibiofemoral) dislocations are true surgical emergencies caused by high energy trauma (eg, motor vehicle collision) and involve injuries to multiple ligaments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and mechanism of injury'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the knee is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-knee-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute knee pain and injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patella is a sesamoid bone embedded in the quadriceps tendon that articulates with the trochlear groove of the femur posteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51102 \">figure 1</a>). Its function is to increase the mechanical advantage of the quadriceps during extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The quadriceps muscle tendon transitions into the patellar tendon which inserts at the tibial tubercle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54565\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54565 \">figure 2</a>). Medial and lateral patellar retinacula arise from the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles, respectively, and comprise the joint capsule on either side of the patella. </p><p>During leg extension, the knee extensors (quadriceps femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis) naturally place an oblique force across the patella that promotes its lateral displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This displacing force is markedly increased during flexion. The medial patellofemoral ligament which connects the medial femoral epicondyle and medial patella along with the vastus medialis obliquus provide the primary opposition to this force (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89127\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89127 \">figure 3</a>), and also help maintain proper tracking of the patella within the trochlear groove of the femur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Abnormalities in several of these structures may predispose to patellar dislocation. (See <a href=\"#H4202108248\" class=\"local\">'Risk for recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5306906\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the natural anatomic tendency for lateral displacement of the patella during quadriceps contraction, lateral patellar dislocation is, by far, most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p>The mechanism of injury varies according to the type of patellar dislocation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lateral</strong> &ndash; Lateral patellar dislocation, the most common type, is usually associated with disruption of the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial retinaculum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It typically occurs when the foot is planted and an internal rotatory twisting force is applied to the flexed knee in valgus (eg, spinning or twirling maneuver in dance or gymnastics, swinging a baseball or softball bat, or quick lateral change of direction while running or ice skating) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Less commonly, direct trauma to the medial knee may result in lateral dislocation. Lateral dislocations can usually be reduced by knowledgeable clinicians without orthopedic consultation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Reduction of lateral dislocations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Superior</strong> &ndash; Superior patellar dislocation is rare. Mechanisms of injury include hyperextension of the knee or a blow to the knee with the leg in extension. Superior patellar dislocations are most commonly reported in older adults with osteoarthritis and a large osteophyte located in the proximal trochlear groove (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89064\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89064 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10310144\" class=\"local\">'Superior patellar dislocation'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medial </strong>&ndash; Medial patellar dislocation is also rare. It has primarily been described as a post-operative complication of a lateral retinacular release procedure. However, lateral trauma has resulted in medial patellar dislocation in one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intra-articular patellar dislocation </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Intra-articular patellar dislocations are rare injuries that are typically associated with injury to the quadriceps insertion on the proximal pole of the patella. These injuries warrant prompt orthopedic consultation for reduction. (See <a href=\"#H6936537\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral or consultation'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Inferior</strong> &ndash; Inferior intra-articular patellar dislocation arises from direct trauma to the proximal portion of the patella of a flexed knee sufficient to cause avulsion of the deep fibers of the quadriceps tendon and permit horizontal dislocation of the superior portion of the patella inferiorly into the joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89062\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89062 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89063\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89063 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These dislocations are most frequently described in adolescent males and the elderly. Interposition of the quadriceps tendon, avulsion fractures, or sleeve fractures of the patella can prevent closed reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Superior</strong> &ndash; Superior horizontal intra-articular patellar dislocations follow trauma to the inferior pole of the patella during knee flexion in elderly patients with arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Vertical </strong>&ndash; Vertical dislocation is the rarest form of patellar dislocation and follows a medial blow to the patella that causes it to flip and wedge between the femoral epicondyles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lateral patellar dislocations account for the vast majority of patellar dislocations and approximately 3 percent of all knee injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/5,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17-19</a>]. Superior and medial dislocations and intra-articular dislocations are rare. (See <a href=\"#H5306906\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of injury'</a> above.)</p><p>Lateral patellar dislocations occur frequently in teenage athletes and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/17,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-22</a>]. Patients younger than 20 years of age are at highest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Adolescent females appear to be predisposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/17,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-22</a>] as are taller, overweight males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Sports and activities frequently associated with lateral patellar dislocation include gymnastics, soccer, ice hockey, dance, weight lifting, and military training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Dislocation typically occurs without contact when the patient plants the foot and applies an internal rotatory force (or tibial valgus force) to a flexed knee. As an example, in one series of 73 men with lateral patellar dislocations, 93 percent of injuries occurred without a history of direct trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

They may also report hearing a pop or tear at the time of dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical examination </strong>&ndash; On examination, the knee typically is held in 20 to 30 degrees of flexion and the patella is palpable laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89126\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89126 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/18,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional findings related to tearing of the restraining medial retinacular tissue and the medial patellofemoral ligament may include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/8,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An acutely swollen knee</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemarthrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tenderness to palpation along the medial edge of the patella</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tenderness just proximal to the medial femoral epicondyle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging</strong> &ndash; Plain radiographs are not necessary before dislocation reduction unless the diagnosis is in question. In one observational study of 80 patients with lateral patella dislocation, radiographs prior to reduction found fractures in 10 percent of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89811\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89811 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, reduction was successful in all patients regardless of radiographic findings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, pre-reduction radiographs do not change management and may prolong the time to reduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radiographs should be obtained after reduction or in patients in whom reduction is not successful. Acute patellar dislocation is frequently associated with osteochondral fractures, including capsular avulsions of the medial patellar margin and loose intra-articular fragments detached from the patella <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lateral femoral condyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

These patients often complain of knee pain and popping or clicking, and occasionally knee swelling, stiffness, or catching. Patellar subluxation, rather than dislocation, may have occurred if the history is consistent with dislocation, but the pain and abnormal examination findings have resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>On physical examination, patients with patellar subluxation may have patella alta, synovitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effusion.

The test is positive if the patient becomes uncomfortable and apprehensive as the patella reaches the point of maximum passive displacement or if the patient begins to resist and straightens the knee to pull the patella back into normal alignment. However, the sensitivity for this test is low (approximately 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Moving patellar apprehension test</strong> &ndash; With the knee in full extension, the clinician pushes the patella laterally while the knee is flexed to 90 degrees and then returned to full extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The clinician then pushes the patella medially while the knee is again flexed to 90 degrees and then fully extended. Apprehension or attempts to resist flexion of the knee while the patella is pushed laterally but not associated with any discomfort while the patella is pushed medially constitutes a positive test. In an observational study of 51 patients (25 with lateral patellar instability), this test had a sensitivity of 100 percent, specificity of 89 percent, and negative predictive value of 100 percent when compared to the ability to dislocate the patella under anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p>Patients with patellar subluxation should have knee radiographs to evaluate for an associated avulsion fracture of the patella or femoral condyle and <span class=\"nowrap\">patellar/femoral</span> trochlear dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Treatment of patellar subluxation is best guided by a sports medicine specialist or orthopedic surgeon. Nonoperative management is aimed at strengthening the quadriceps, principally the vastus medialis obliquus, and minimizing knee valgus by strengthening the hip abductors. In addition, stretching of the iliotibial band is typically encouraged to decrease lateral pull on the patella through its distal attachment. Patellar taping and patellar stabilizing orthoses may also be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Physical examination demonstrates tenting of the suprapatellar region with a dimple below. The patellar tendon is intact by palpation. Both the patient age and appearance help distinguish a superior patellar dislocation from a lateral patellar dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Antero-posterior and lateral radiographs are diagnostic and often show interlocking of inferior patellar and anterior femoral osteophytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89064\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89064 \">image 1</a>). </p><p>After administration of parenteral analgesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>), reduction is performed by gently moving the patella side to side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-initial-management-of-patellar-dislocations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Post-reduction films, including AP, lateral, and patellar (&quot;sunrise&quot; or &quot;tunnel&quot; view) knee radiographs should be performed.

Fractures can also result from an indirect force applied to the patella through sudden, forceful contraction of the quadriceps, such as landing on one's feet after jumping from a moderate height or coming to a sudden stop from a full sprint. Examination typically reveals a joint effusion and focal tenderness of the patella. The patella is <strong>not</strong> displaced laterally. The patient may not be able to extend the knee against gravity, and a gap in the extensor mechanism may be palpable. A hemarthrosis is noted if the joint is aspirated to relieve the pain from a tense effusion.

The injury typically occurs when a patient&rsquo;s knee is flexed 60 degrees or more and sustains a force that suddenly increases the degree of flexion. In such circumstances, the patellar tendon avulses from the distal patellar pole. If the rupture occurs within the substance of the tendon, the clinician should consider secondary causes, such as anabolic steroid abuse or recent treatment with quinolone antibiotics. The patient with a patellar tendon rupture often has significant knee swelling and pain, and cannot fully extend the knee. Rarely, the injury may be associated with ACL tears or other injuries, such as superior patellar dislocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89862\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89862 \">image 9</a>).
