Emphysema causes dyspnea through airflow limitation, hyperinflation, and loss of gas exchanging surfaces in the lungs (also known as increased physiologic dead space).</p><p>Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS, also called reduction pneumoplasty or bilateral pneumectomy) is a surgical technique that may be beneficial for some patients with advanced emphysema who have poor control of their disease despite maximal medical therapy. LVRS entails reducing the lung volume by wedge excision of emphysematous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The indications, contraindications, technique, and outcomes of LVRS will be reviewed here. The general management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the evaluation and management of giant bullae, and the role of lung transplantation in end-stage emphysema are discussed separately.

It has been suggested that LVRS reduces the size mismatching between the hyperinflated lungs and the chest cavity, thereby restoring the outward circumferential pull on the bronchioles (ie, increasing elastic recoil) and improving expiratory airflow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. As an example, in a study of 20 patients undergoing volume reduction surgery, 16 experienced an increase in elastic recoil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The patients with improved elastic recoil had a significantly greater increase in exercise capacity than the four without increased elastic recoil.</p><p>Other postulated mechanisms for clinical benefit include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvement in the mechanical function of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles by decreasing the functional residual capacity (FRC; the amount of air left in the lungs after exhalation of a tidal volume breath) and returning the diaphragm to a more normal curved and lengthened configuration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55440\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55440 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In a study that examined the relative contribution of the thoracic (intercostal and scalene muscles) and abdominal (diaphragm) compartments to tidal volume breaths, an increase in the abdominal contribution was noted after LVRS, suggesting improved diaphragmatic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, improved synchrony of the diaphragm with other inspiratory muscles was noted, suggesting a reduction in respiratory muscle fatigue following LVRS. Improved chest wall asynchrony has also been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved left ventricular filling, end-diastolic dimension, and cardiac index due to decreased intrathoracic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in lung volumes during exercise (ie, reduced dynamic hyperinflation), which is associated with reduced exertional dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

LVRS modestly improves spirometry, lung volumes, exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life and may improve long-term survival among highly selected patients. Certain clinical features appear to influence the degree of risk and benefit. </p><p>A systematic review identified 11 studies (1760 participants), of which almost 70 percent were from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Short-term mortality was higher with LVRS (odds ratio [OR] 6.16, 95% CI 3.22-11.79, 1489 participants), while long-term mortality favored LVRS (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.95, 1280 participants). Participants with upper lung zone predominant emphysema and poor exercise tolerance appeared to have a better outcome, as described below.

Following a baseline assessment, the patients underwent 6 to 10 weeks of mandatory pulmonary rehabilitation and were then randomly assigned to LVRS or continued medical therapy.

Patients with these characteristics were subsequently excluded from enrollment in NETT and LVRS is contraindicated in such patients.</p><p>Among patients without these high-risk characteristics, the 30-day mortality rate was 2.2 percent in the LVRS group, compared with 0.2 percent in the medical therapy group (p&lt;0.001). At two years, total mortality among non-high-risk patients did not differ between the LVRS and medical therapy groups (0.09 versus 0.10 deaths per person-year).</p><p>Improvement in exercise capacity was defined as an increase in the maximal workload of more than 10 watts at 24 months compared with the post-rehabilitation baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Excluding the high-risk group, exercise capacity improved by more than 10 watts in 16 percent of LVRS patients and 3 percent of medical therapy patients. In a separate analysis, the mean difference in maximal workload between the two groups was 10.9 watts, favoring LVRS, with 10 watts being the minimal clinically important difference in patients with severe emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In addition to the high-risk group (called group A) described above (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Primary endpoints'</a> above), the response of four additional subgroups to LVRS versus medical therapy was assessed.

Testing typically includes pulmonary function tests, a six-minute walk test, arterial blood gas, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram with measurement of pulmonary artery pressures, a cardiopulmonary exercise test, and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The results of this assessment are used to determine the patient's candidacy for LVRS.</p><p>HRCT has several roles in the evaluation of patients for possible LVRS: to confirm the presence of emphysema, quantitate the amount of lung affected, assess the anatomic distribution, and identify other conditions that may preclude LVRS.

Correct placement of the endotracheal tube is confirmed bronchoscopically. Deflation of the operative lung may be slow due to the underlying obstructive airways disease and may require gentle suctioning and external pressure.</p><p>During single lung ventilation, patients with advanced COPD may develop air trapping and hyperinflation, causing hemodynamic instability. Ventilatory techniques, such as using low tidal volumes (eg, 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> lower respiratory rates, and longer expiratory times (eg, an inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:3 or 1:5), can help to prevent this complication. Lowering minute ventilation in this way may lead to alveolar hypoventilation and elevation in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>). Accepting deliberate alveolar hypoventilation to mitigate auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP) is known as permissive hypercapnic ventilation (PHV). With this technique, the pH is allowed to drop gradually into the range of 7.35 to 7.2.

When bilateral LVRS is planned, most experts operate on the more severely affected side first. Unilateral LVRS is typically performed through a lateral thoracotomy or a video-assisted thoracoscopic approach.</p><p>The decision about whether to perform LVRS via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy depends in large part on the surgical and institutional expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In a nonrandomized analysis of National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) data, morbidity and mortality were similar when LVRS was performed via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Typically, the amount of lung resected is 20 to 35 percent of each lung or as much as 60 percent of the total thoracic volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/23,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,40</a>]. The goal is to remove as much diseased lung as possible, while preserving the greatest amount of functioning lung.</p><p>Buttressed staple sutures are typically employed to close the resultant defects and prevent air leaks. Bovine pericardial strips <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other materials (eg, polytetrafluoroethylene strips) may be used to buttress the suture line and reduce the incidence of postoperative air leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/40,48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,48-52</a>]. Less than 5 percent of patients in NETT had unbuttressed suture lines, so insufficient data are available to compare results with and without buttressed sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>After completion of the wedge resections, two chest tubes are placed in the chest cavity, the clamp or bronchial blocker is removed from that side of the endotracheal tube, and mechanical ventilation is resumed to the deflated lung. A gradual reinflation is preferred to aggressive efforts at reinflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Laser ablation has been compared to stapler resection in patients undergoing unilateral LVRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. Based on the observation of increased mortality in one study, an increase in the frequency of late pneumothorax in another study, and a decreased improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) at six months, the laser ablation technique has been abandoned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately postoperatively, patients are assessed for anemia due to excessive intraoperative blood loss, cardiac ischemia, electrolyte abnormalities, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and inadequate lung reexpansion (eg, due to air leak, suboptimal function of chest tubes). If these factors are all acceptable, the patient is extubated. The majority of patients are extubated in the operating room to minimize the duration of positive pressure ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Postextubation respiratory insufficiency can result from bronchoconstriction from the underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atelectasis, pneumothorax, hypoventilation due to postoperative pain, or pneumonia. For awake patients with a rising arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) despite prompt attention to these factors, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may be used to avoid reintubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due to the high proportion of patients with air leaks, careful attention to the proper function of the chest tubes is key to prevent development of a pneumothorax and consequent respiratory insufficiency. Brief kinking or blockage of a chest tube can lead to rapid accumulation of a pneumothorax and cardiopulmonary decompensation. A chest radiograph is obtained daily to confirm full lung reexpansion. Chest tubes are generally left in place until the lung is fully re-expanded and there is no evidence of air leak. The procedure for chest tube removal is described separately.

Among the 511 non-high-risk patients in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) who underwent LVRS, the operative mortality rate was 6 percent (includes high-risk patients), major pulmonary morbidity 30 percent, and major cardiovascular morbidity 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The most common complications were reintubation (22 percent), arrhythmias (19 percent), pneumonia (18 percent), mechanical ventilation for more than two days (13 percent), and persistent air leak for 30 days (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

It would be helpful for future studies to provide information about mortality at later time points. Missing data on 14 percent of patients may affect the outcomes reported.</p><p>A review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database suggested that the number of LVRS procedures declined from 2000 to 2010; the in-hospital mortality was 6 percent and did not change significantly over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Age &gt;65 was the strongest predictor for in-hospital mortality; the presence of interstitial lung disease and malnutrition were also independent predictors.</p><p>Air leak following LVRS is frequent. In NETT, approximately 90 percent of patients had an air leak within 30 days of LVRS; the mean duration of air leak was seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Patients with a low DLCO, upper lobe predominant emphysema, and pleural adhesions were more likely to have a persistent air leak and to experience prolonged leakage. In addition, Caucasian patients, patients using inhaled glucocorticoids, and patients with a low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) tended to have a protracted duration of air leak.</p><p>In a separate series, among 250 consecutive patients who underwent LVRS, persistent air leaks lasting over seven days occurred in 45 percent; re-exploration for air leaks or bleeding was needed in 3 and 1 percent, respectively.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emerging therapies for COPD: Bronchoscopic treatment of emphysema&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543870560\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), also called reduction pneumoplasty, is a surgical technique that involves reducing the lung volume by multiple wedge excisions in areas where emphysematous changes are most marked. Typically, the amount of tissue resected is 20 to 35 percent of the volume of each lung. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LVRS modestly improves spirometry, lung volumes, exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life and may improve long-term survival among highly selected patients. Certain clinical features appear to influence the degree of risk and benefit. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'National Emphysema Treatment Trial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential complications of LVRS include persistent air leak, intraoperative myocardial infarction, reintubation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, pneumonia, wound infection, arrhythmias, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend NOT performing LVRS in high-risk patients (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] of 20 percent predicted or less and either a diffusing capacity [DLCO] of 20 percent predicted or less or homogeneous emphysema on chest computed tomography) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'National Emphysema Treatment Trial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have advanced emphysema that is upper lobe predominant, who have a low post-rehabilitation exercise tolerance despite maximal medical therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and who meet the inclusion criteria established by the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), we suggest performing LVRS rather than continuing with medical therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For all other patients with advanced emphysema, the decision to perform LVRS should be made on a case-by-case basis, with careful consideration of the patient's values and preferences. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'National Emphysema Treatment Trial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency appear less likely to benefit from LVRS than patients with emphysema who are alpha-1 antitrypsin replete. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency&quot;, section on 'Lung volume reduction surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with advanced COPD are at increased risk for perioperative complications. All patients being considered for LVRS require careful preoperative assessment to ensure that medical therapy for COPD has been optimized and that any comorbid illnesses have been identified and treated, as needed. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of whether to perform LVRS via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy is usually based on the surgical and institutional expertise and preference. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Thoracotomy versus thoracoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients are extubated in the operating room. Management of postoperative pain usually involves a combination of regional and systemic agents to enable early mobilization of the patient and effective cough. Due to the high frequency of air leaks, careful attention to the proper function of the chest tubes is essential. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LVRS does not automatically exclude a patient from undergoing lung transplantation. Limited experience with patients who initially undergo LVRS suggests that subsequent successful transplantation is possible. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'LVRS and lung transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">BRANTIGAN OC, MUELLER E, KRESS MB.
