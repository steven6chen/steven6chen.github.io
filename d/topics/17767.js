In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with ENKL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hepatitis B virus, HIV, and uric acid.

Visualization of lesions outside the mouth is best accomplished by mirror examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of a flexible fiberoptic endoscope with the goal of examining all of the mucosa in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Aside from mucosal irregularities, other abnormalities that should be specifically searched for are impairment of vocal cord mobility, pooling of secretions, asymmetries, and bleeding. Random nasopharyngeal biopsies are performed even when no lesions are seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are complementary techniques; both modalities should be performed to evaluate the extent of disease and to distinguish tumor from infection, retained secretions, and granulation of scar tissue. Due to the nature of tumor occurring in the nasal structures, CT offers superior bony definition and MRI gives superior soft tissue delineation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-nk-t-cell-lymphoma-nasal-type/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As such, we perform CT and MRI of the head plus a CT of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis. These studies provide critical information on the measurement of disease prior to treatment and aids in staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-nk-t-cell-lymphoma-nasal-type/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most cases of ENKL are FDG-avid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-nk-t-cell-lymphoma-nasal-type/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A combined positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scan at diagnosis is strongly recommended to serve as a baseline for comparison after therapy, because the precise determination of residual lymphoma may be difficult without <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span>.

Occasionally, it is more important to stabilize a patient's condition and correct or control co-morbidities, such as infection and bleeding, than it is to immediately start radiotherapy or chemotherapy. This interval of several days also allows for complete staging and pretreatment evaluation where the results will have an impact on the choice of treatment. However, treatment must be started as soon as possible for patients with a rapidly deteriorating clinical status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3926208796\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1325856368\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of patients with extranodal <span class=\"nowrap\">NK/T</span> cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL) is largely determined by the extent of disease. This approach is largely consistent with that described by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Society for Medical Oncology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-nk-t-cell-lymphoma-nasal-type/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Once the diagnosis of ENKL has been established, subsequent therapy and prognosis are based upon the stage of the disease. The following staging classification is modified from that for primary nodal lymphomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>) and is more practical for the management of this particular disease. &#160;</p><p>Localized disease includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I(E) &ndash; Single extranodal involvement (usually of the upper aerodigestive tract) with or without contiguous involvement extending to adjacent structures (eg, tumor with an extension to the nasal cavity, the maxillary antra, anterior or posterior ethmoid sinus, sphenoidal sinus, orbit, superior alveolar bone, cheeks, superior buccinator space, or hard palate).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II(E) &ndash; Stage I(E) disease (usually of the upper aerodigestive tract) <strong>plus</strong> one or more of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cervical lymph node involvement (contiguous stage IIE)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Involvement of other supradiaphragmatic lymph node regions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Isolated involvement of additional sites in the head and neck (eg, Waldeyer&rsquo;s ring, oropharynx, hypopharynx, etc.)</p><p/><p>Advanced disease includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III(E) (rare) &ndash; Stage I(E) disease (usually of the upper aerodigestive tract) <strong>with</strong> cervical lymph node involvement <strong>plus</strong> infradiaphragmatic lymph node involvement <strong><span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</strong></span> involvement of the spleen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage I(E) disease (usually of the upper aerodigestive tract) <strong>plus</strong> isolated distant involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any involvement of the liver or bone marrow</p><p/><p>More than two-thirds of patients with ENKL occurring outside the upper aerodigestive tract have advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-nk-t-cell-lymphoma-nasal-type/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients present with localized disease that initially responds well to radiation with or without chemotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78792\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78792 \">figure 1</a>).

It may also be influenced by access to radiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2101904638\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with localized ENKL (ie, stage I or contiguous stage II), we suggest combined modality therapy (CMT) with concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy, rather than RT or chemotherapy alone or sequentially (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For most patients with localized disease, we offer CMT with a radiation dose of 50 Gy and concurrent therapy with reduced dose (ie, two-thirds dose) DeVIC (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1103611272\" class=\"local\">'Localized disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We do not routinely administer central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis for patients with localized ENKL who are treated with CMT that includes DeVIC and RT. (See <a href=\"#H1854990478\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are not fit for CMT, we treat with RT followed by non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (eg, DeVIC, VIDL). We offer RT alone to patients who are not fit for chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H1103611272\" class=\"local\">'Localized disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with disseminated ENKL (stage III or IV), and for those with noncontiguous stage II disease or ENKL occurring outside the upper aerodigestive tract, we suggest the use of a combination chemotherapy regimen incorporating L-asparaginase rather than CHOP chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most such patients, we treat with SMILE (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, L-asparaginase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>) chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H874592744\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For older patients with disseminated ENKL and those not fit to tolerate SMILE, we treat with a less intensive L-asparaginase-containing chemotherapy, dose-reduced DeVIC, or gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H874592744\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We generally do not administer CNS prophylaxis when treating patients with disseminated ENKL with SMILE chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H1854990478\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who achieve a partial response after induction therapy, we suggest consolidation with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A choice between autologous and allogeneic HCT as consolidation therapy depends upon the patient's performance status and organ function and the availability of a donor. (See <a href=\"#H2097289089\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We also offer HCT to patients with advanced or <span class=\"nowrap\">relapsed/refractory</span> ENKL who achieve complete response (CR). We do not routinely pursue HCT in patients with localized ENKL who achieve a CR. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 25 percent of patients with localized disease and 80 percent of patients with disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis will either not achieve remission or will relapse. Our general approach is to administer a second-line combination chemotherapy regimen with the hope of attaining a complete or partial remission. (See <a href=\"#H874592744\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who attain a complete or partial remission with second-line chemotherapy, we suggest consolidation with HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A choice between autologous and allogeneic HCT depends upon the patient's performance status and organ function and the availability of a donor.
