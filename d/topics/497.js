The treatment of AIDS-related KS is discussed separately, as is the classic form of Kaposi sarcoma.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIDS-related or epidemic KS &mdash; AIDS-related or epidemic KS is the most common tumor arising in HIV-infected persons. KS is considered an AIDS-defining illness in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In the United States, KS was over 20,000 times more common in persons with AIDS than in the general population prior to the widespread use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), although its incidence has declined substantially since that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endemic or African &mdash; KS was endemic in all parts of equatorial Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, prior to the HIV epidemic. Since the onset of the HIV epidemic, the incidence of KS has increased dramatically in those regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organ transplant-associated &mdash; The incidence of KS is increased after solid organ transplantation, presumably at least partially due to chronic immunosuppression. In addition, the transplant itself may transmit HHV-8 infection. The clinical presentation in this setting is similar to that of classic KS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;, section on 'Kaposi sarcoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic &mdash; Classic KS is an indolent cutaneous proliferative disease mainly affecting older men of Mediterranean and Jewish origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

AIDS-related KS is much less common in heterosexual injection drug users, transfusion recipients, women or children, and hemophiliacs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In patients with AIDS-related KS, the CD4 count appears to be an important factor associated with the development of KS. In a series of 70 patients who presented with a new diagnosis of KS while on treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy (ART), the rate ratios for developing KS for patients with CD4 counts &lt;200, 200-349, and 350-499 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm3</span> were 18.9, 3.6, and 4.1, compared to those with &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm3</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>However, trends in earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved health care continuity have altered the epidemiology of AIDS-related malignancies. In a study including 466 patients with AIDS-related KS, less than half of KS cases diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 were in patients with CD4 counts &lt;200, with 29 percent having a viral load &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This reflects the growing proportion of the HIV population that, due to ART, has higher CD4 counts and suppressed viral loads, rather than an increased risk of cancer among such patients. In resource-rich areas, AIDS-related KS is predominantly a disease of men. In contrast, in resource poor areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS-related KS is also more frequent in males, although the difference is less pronounced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432033191\"><span class=\"h3\">Impact of antiretroviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of KS has declined markedly in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The dramatic impact of ART on the incidence of KS is illustrated by an analysis of more than 375,000 people with AIDS, in which the incidence of various cancers was analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for KS compared to the general population fell from 22,100 to 3640 with the widespread use of ART. Other large epidemiologic studies have reported a similar decrease in the incidence of KS correlating with the introduction of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>].</p><p>The incidence of KS is particularly high during the first six months following the initiation of ART, and then falls dramatically with continued treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The high incidence immediately following ART initiation may be attributable to the relatively severe immunosuppression that led to ART or to unmasking of KS by the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.</p><p>The declining incidence of KS cannot be attributed to a decreased incidence of HHV-8 infection. In one report, the prevalence of HHV-8 infection remained approximately constant among men in San Francisco from <span class=\"nowrap\">1978/79</span> (26.5 percent) through <span class=\"nowrap\">1984/85</span> (29.6 percent) and <span class=\"nowrap\">1995/96</span> (26.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Human herpesvirus-8</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a strong relationship between the development of KS, HHV-8 infection, and HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-epidemiology-and-transmission-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology, epidemiology, and transmission of human herpesvirus 8 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a study conducted in San Francisco, HHV-8 seropositivity was observed in 38 percent of 593 men who have sex with men (MSM) compared to none of 195 heterosexual men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among HIV-infected patients who were infected with both HIV and HHV-8 at baseline, the 10-year probability of developing KS was approximately 50 percent. The 10-year risk was about 30 percent in HIV-infected men who were not seropositive for HHV-8 at baseline, while there were no cases of KS among the HIV-negative men. This study was conducted before the widespread use of potent combined antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the frequency of progression of HHV-8 infection to KS appears to have decreased since that time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432033448\"><span class=\"h2\">Steroids and infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroid therapy has been associated with the induction of KS and the exacerbation of preexisting KS in HIV-infected persons, as well as in non-AIDS patients receiving corticosteroids for organ transplantation, autoimmune disorders, or lymphoproliferative diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The association of corticosteroids with KS is important because of the frequent use of these agents in HIV-infected patients with a variety of disorders including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. In such patients, KS lesions may regress upon reduction or withdrawal of steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Opportunistic infections have also been associated with the induction of KS and with the exacerbation of preexisting KS similar to that described with corticosteroid therapy. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which have been demonstrated in the setting of opportunistic infections, may account for these effects on KS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432027014\"><span class=\"h1\">CUTANEOUS KS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although KS can involve virtually any site in the body, cutaneous disease is most common and is the usual initial presentation for KS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865064422\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cutaneous lesions of KS appear most often on the lower extremities, face (especially the nose), oral mucosa, and genitalia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60346%7EDERM%2F69357%7EDERM%2F79726%7EDERM%2F74359%7EONC%2F78116%7EONC%2F79283%7EDERM%2F70919%7EDERM%2F52327%7EDERM%2F65310%7EDERM%2F60162\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60346 graphicRef69357 graphicRef79726 graphicRef74359 graphicRef78116 graphicRef79283 graphicRef70919 graphicRef52327 graphicRef65310 graphicRef60162 \">picture 1A-J</a>). The lesions are often elliptical and may be arranged in a linear fashion along skin tension lines; they may be symmetrically distributed. The lesions are not painful or pruritic and usually do not produce necrosis of overlying skin or underlying structures.</p><p>The assortment of colors associated with these lesions is due to their vascularity and includes many hues of pink, red, purple, and brown. Yellow perilesional halos may occasionally be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79013 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Early lesions can easily be mistaken as purpura, hematomas, angiomas, dermatofibromas, or nevi. More commonly, however, KS lesions are papular, ranging in size from several millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. Less commonly, KS lesions may be plaque-like, especially on the soles of the feet and thigh, or exophytic and fungating with breakdown of overlying skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65310%7EDERM%2F60162%7EONC%2F69203\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65310 graphicRef60162 graphicRef69203 \">picture 1I-K</a>).</p><p>Lymphedema, particularly in the face, genitalia, and lower extremities may be out of proportion to the extent of the disease and may be related to both vascular obstruction by lymphadenopathy and the cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of KS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865064605\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of cutaneous KS can often be made by a trained observer. However, early lesions can easily be mistaken as purpura, hematomas, angiomas, dermatofibromas, or nevi.</p><p>Bacillary angiomatosis is the most important alternative in the differential diagnosis. Bacillary angiomatosis is caused by Bartonella species, a slow-growing, fastidious, gram-negative bacillus, and is readily treated with antibiotic therapy. Skin lesions of bacillary angiomatosis usually appear as numerous small red to purple papules that may gradually expand into large pedunculated lesions or nodules that may become friable. The rash may be associated with symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, headache, and anorexia. Biopsy is especially important for atypical lesions that are associated with systemic symptoms or appear or progress rapidly, in order to rule out bacillary angiomatosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Bartonella infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Bartonella infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>KS and bacillary angiomatosis can occur simultaneously in the same patient. Furthermore, bacillary angiomatosis lesions can be associated with neovascularization and solid areas of spindle cells that mimic KS. The diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis is established by the identified of the causative organisms with Warthin-Starry silver staining.</p><p>Less commonly, KS can be mimicked by extrapulmonary Pneumocystis jirovecii, even in the absence of coexisting lung infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865064994\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a presumptive diagnosis of KS can often be made based upon the characteristic appearance of the lesions, this should be confirmed by a biopsy whenever possible. Biopsy is especially important for atypical lesions that are associated with systemic symptoms or appear or progress rapidly, in order to rule out bacillary angiomatosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865065094\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three histologic features that are characteristic of KS, both in cutaneous and visceral sites: angiogenesis, inflammation, and proliferation. The lesions generally show two major abnormalities: whorls of spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration and neovascularization with aberrant proliferation of small vessels.</p><p>These small vessels lack a basement membrane and display leaky behavior with microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As the disease progresses, it evolves from patches to plaques, and then to a nodular form. The characteristic histologic pattern of KS does not differ among the affected epidemiologic groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865064429\"><span class=\"h1\">VISCERAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>KS involvement has been observed in almost all visceral sites, including lymph nodes, liver, pancreas, heart, the testes, bone marrow, bone, and skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The most frequent sites of noncutaneous disease are the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. However, visceral involvement as the initial manifestation of KS is relatively uncommon. Furthermore, visceral disease now appears to be much less frequent, given the use of antiretroviral therapy as well as multiple treatment options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432027021\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral cavity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of the oral cavity occurs in about one-third of patients with KS and is the initial site in about 15 percent. The dental practitioner is often the first to identify these lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61561%7EDERM%2F50835\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61561 graphicRef50835 \">picture 3A-B</a>). The diagnosis of KS should be confirmed by biopsy whenever possible. </p><p>The intraoral site most commonly affected is the palate followed by the gingiva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Intraoral lesions may become easily traumatized during normal chewing, which can result in pain, bleeding, ulceration, or secondary infection. If lesions are advanced, they may interfere with nutrition and speech.</p><p>The presence or absence of symptoms from oral lesions is often a major factor in treatment decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432027028\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the widespread introduction of ART, the gastrointestinal tract was involved in approximately 40 percent of patients with KS at initial diagnosis and in up to 80 percent at autopsy. </p><p>Gastrointestinal involvement can occur in the absence of cutaneous disease. Gastrointestinal lesions may be asymptomatic or may cause weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, malabsorption, intestinal obstruction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Gastrointestinal KS lesions are easily recognized by the endoscopist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87392\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87392 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. They are typically hemorrhagic nodules that can be either isolated or confluent and may occur in any portion of the gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59519\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59519 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The diagnosis of KS should be confirmed by biopsy whenever possible, although biopsies may not demonstrate KS because the lesions tend to be submucosal. High grade lesions are more likely to be associated with invasion and dissemination.</p><p>Treatment is usually dictated by the presence or absence of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Staging and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432027035\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary involvement is common in AIDS-related KS.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-involvement-in-aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary involvement in AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Affected patients can present with shortness of breath, fever, cough, hemoptysis, or chest pain, or pulmonary involvement may be an asymptomatic finding first observed on chest x-ray. Radiographic findings are variable and can include nodular, interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alveolar infiltrates, pleural effusion, hilar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediastinal adenopathy, or even an isolated nodule.</p><p>The KS lesions have a characteristic appearance of cherry-red, slightly raised lesions seen at bronchoscopy, which can result in a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary KS. Although bronchoscopic and radiographic findings correlate quite well, patients who have KS documented by bronchoscopy may on occasion have normal chest x-rays. </p><p>Treatment decisions are usually guided by the presence of respiratory symptoms, the extent of radiographic and bronchoscopic disease, and exclusion of a concomitant pulmonary infection as the cause of the clinical findings.

KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) is marked by clinical symptoms such as fever, edema, neuropathy, and gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, which occur in the context of evidence of KSHV viral activity, elevated CRP, and other laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Diagnosis of KICS depends on histopathologic exclusion of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) if lymphadenopathy is present. While many of the clinical and laboratory findings of KICS exist in patients with KSHV-associated MCD, KICS typically lacks the splenomegaly and widespread lymphadenopathy that characterize MCD and is associated with a higher KSHV-associated tumor burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Human herpesvirus-8'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Management considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of KS rose dramatically with the onset of the AIDS epidemic. However, the introduction and widespread use of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) led to a marked decline in the incidence of KS. AIDS-related KS is seen predominantly among homosexual men rather than in other HIV-infected groups (IV drug users, women, transfusion recipients). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KS typically presents with cutaneous disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60346%7EDERM%2F69357%7EDERM%2F79726%7EDERM%2F74359%7EONC%2F78116%7EONC%2F79283%7EDERM%2F70919%7EDERM%2F52327%7EDERM%2F65310%7EDERM%2F60162\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60346 graphicRef69357 graphicRef79726 graphicRef74359 graphicRef78116 graphicRef79283 graphicRef70919 graphicRef52327 graphicRef65310 graphicRef60162 \">picture 1A-J</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79013 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69203\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69203 \">picture 1K</a>). Although the diagnosis can often be made based upon the characteristic appearance of the cutaneous lesions, this should be confirmed with a biopsy whenever possible. A biopsy is particularly important in cases with atypical features. (See <a href=\"#H865064605\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H865064994\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KS can also involve a wide range of visceral organs, including particularly the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. Visceral involvement is typically a later manifestation of disease, and is unusual as an isolated site for the initial presentation. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Moore PS, Chang Y.
