The clinical features and classification of hypertrophic scars and keloids are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F95115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95115 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Hypertrophic scars present as raised lesions with varying degree of erythema depending upon the maturation stage that typically do not exceed the margins of the original wound. They usually develop two to six months after the initial insult and show a tendency to regress at 18 to 24 months following injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Associated symptoms include pain, pruritus, and functional limitations. Keloids can occur months or years after injury, extend beyond the limits of the initial injury, and show no tendency to regress.</p><p>Many treatments have been tried, with limited success, to reduce the symptoms associated with abnormal scarring, such as redness, pain, pruritus, or functional limitations, and to improve the clinical appearance. These treatments range from minimally invasive interventions (eg, massage, moisturizing agents, pressure garments, silicone sheeting) to topical or intralesional corticosteroids, surgical excision with various reconstructive techniques, or radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Unfortunately, recurrence rates are high, and multiple or combination therapies are often required to reduce the scar volume and achieve functional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cosmetic improvement.</p><p>Laser therapy is a relatively new treatment modality for keloids and hypertrophic scars. In particular, the utilization of specific laser platforms has emerged as a successful strategy in the treatment of symptomatic hypertrophic scars following burn injury.</p><p>This topic will discuss the available modes of laser therapy for the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids, with a focus on treatment of hypertrophic burn scars. Other treatment modalities for hypertrophic scars and keloids are discussed separately. The principles of laser therapy and the use of laser for the treatment of other skin conditions are also discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keloids and hypertrophic scars&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-scarring-and-keloids-following-burn-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic scarring and keloids following burn injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-laser-and-intense-pulsed-light-for-cutaneous-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-hyperpigmentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous hyperpigmentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ablative-laser-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ablative laser resurfacing for skin rejuvenation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonablative-skin-resurfacing-for-skin-rejuvenation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonablative skin resurfacing for skin rejuvenation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Light-based, adjunctive, and other therapies for acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57437438\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lasers are focused beams of light energy released in the form of photons. The light energy is produced and amplified in a lasing cavity flanked by two parallel mirrors. Within the cavity is a lasing medium, consisting of a solid, liquid, or gas compound that is stimulated by an external power source. The excited electrons produce energy in the form of photons when they spontaneously return to the resting state. This organized stream of photons exits the cavity and is guided towards a focusing lens to produce a laser beam. The wavelength of photons is determined by the choice of lasing medium. Lasers can be delivered continuously, in short high-energy pulses, or in nanosecond pulses, called Q-switching.</p><p>The number of photons, measured in Joules (J), constitutes the amount of energy delivered by the laser. Power is the rate of energy delivered, measured in watts (W = <span class=\"nowrap\">J/s)</span>. Fluence is the energy delivered per unit area <span class=\"nowrap\">(J/cm<sup>2</sup>),</span> while irradiance is measured as the power per unit area <span class=\"nowrap\">(W/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span>.</p><p>Only the light that is absorbed by chromophores produces tissue effects. Common skin chromophores include hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and melanin. Tissue effects can be mechanical, thermal, or chemical and depend upon both the properties of the light and the interaction of the light with chromophores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The parameters by which light can be used to destroy targets in the skin through the selective absorption of light by chromophores and spatial confinement of the effect were first described in the theory of selective photothermolysis in 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The majority of subsequent developments in laser technology for cutaneous disorders have been based upon this theory.</p><p>Lasers generate heat, which initiates inflammation and increases vascular permeability, matrix metalloproteinase production, and collagen fiber fascicle decomposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The tissue hypoxia caused by targeted vascular destruction leads to cell catabolism and prevents collagen deposition. Based upon these considerations, early application of lasers is thought to shorten the duration of acute inflammatory response and accelerate the time to scar maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Lasers are categorized into ablative and nonablative types. Ablative-type lasers reach their targets in the dermis by ablating the epidermis. The prolonged recovery period and risks of complications, such as dyspigmentation and further scarring, stimulated the development of fractional and nonablative lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Fractional resurfacing creates microscopic columns of ablation, thereby approaching the effect of ablative techniques while reducing the risk of complications and shortening the time to recovery. Nonablative lasers are able to target chromophores in the dermal layer while preserving the epidermis, yielding coagulation of tissues rather than vaporization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57437396\"><span class=\"h1\">LASER AND LIGHT-BASED PLATFORMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are at least four types of lasers commonly used for hypertrophic scars that have documented efficacy in treating various components of these abnormal scars. Platforms include pulsed dye laser (PDL), fractional carbon dioxide (fCO<sub>2</sub>) laser, alexandrite and diode lasers, and intense pulse light (IPL). Often, two or more of these modalities are combined to improve the outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, alexandrite laser and diode laser are used to destroy problematic hair follicles in the scar tissue that can potentially lead to skin irritation and infection.</p><p>Traditional or nonfractional ablative lasers, including CO<sub>2</sub> and argon lasers, which induce nonspecific thermal damage with significant postoperative pain, prolonged erythema, and high recurrence and infection rates, are no longer used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605312395\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulsed dye laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PDL at 585 nm and 595 nm wavelengths has been studied extensively for scar remodeling since its introduction in the mid-1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This laser selectively targets hemoglobin and has become the standard of care in the treatment of port wine stains, capillary malformations, and some hemangiomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The energy delivered to the dermis coagulates the microvasculature up to a depth of 1.2 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This leads to an overall decrease in inflammation by selective photothermolysis of pathologic, neovascularized tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>]. The resulting tissue hypoxia leads to neocollagenesis, collagen fiber heating, dissociation of disulfide bonds, and subsequent collagen fiber realignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At the cellular level, PDL decreases fibroblast proliferation, type III (but not type I) collagen deposition, and histamine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Decrease of the scar erythema and pruritus is the main clinical effect of PDL therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Additional benefits include reduced scar height and volume and improved texture and pliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57438891\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of PDL 585 nm and 595 nm for the treatment of hypertrophic scars has been evaluated in a few randomized and nonrandomized trials and two systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. However, the heterogeneity in the type and settings of the laser device used across studies makes the comparison among studies difficult. In addition, most studies have significant methodologic flaws that limit the conclusions that can be drawn.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of 10 studies (248 patients) of PDL therapy for the treatment of hypertrophic scars found a low or moderate improvement in erythema, scar volume, and pliability associated with treatment with PDL 585 nm and 595 nm, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent small, randomized trial including 13 children, PDL 595 nm was applied to graft seams of healed skin grafts placed for reconstruction after burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. One-half of the seams were treated with PDL, and the entire scar received standard compression therapy through the duration of the study. After two to three treatments, a greater improvement in vascularity, pigmentation, pliability, scar height, and skin elasticity (assessed by clinician evaluation and Vancouver Scar Scale [VSS]) was noted in the areas treated with PDL plus compression therapy compared with compression therapy alone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57437450\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractional laser resurfacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractional laser resurfacing was first introduced for the treatment of photoaging and is largely used for cosmetic indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. With this technique, microscopic columns of skin called microscopic treatment zones (MTZs) are treated with either ablative or nonablative lasers, resulting in the generation of microscopic thermal wounds with sparing of the tissue surrounding each wound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53757 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>fCO<sub>2 </sub>10,600 nm and erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) 2940 nm ablative lasers are the primary lasers used for hypertrophic scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These devices produce MTZs that are 70 to 100 microns in diameter and 250 to 800 microns in depth. Since the target chromophore of CO<sub>2</sub> (10,600 nm) laser is intracellular water, treatment results in tissue vaporization and coagulation of surrounding extracellular proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast, nonablative lasers induce coagulation only.</p><p>At the molecular level, fractional laser treatment induces fibroblast apoptosis, upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and heat shock proteins, downregulation of transforming growth factors and basic fibroblast growth factor, and alteration of types I and III procollagen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/11,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23,24</a>]. These changes are seen throughout the dermis, beyond the MTZs, with the spared skin surrounding the MTZs contributing to rapid and controlled wound healing with relative normalization of collagen structure and composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Settings for fCO<sub>2</sub> laser include depth, density, pulse energy, shape, and size. The depth of penetration corresponds to pulse energy level and should be tailored to scar thickness. Whether laser depth should penetrate beyond the scar thickness is still being investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Density sets the number of MTZs per unit area. Recommended density is less than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An inverse relation between density and pulse energy should be applied for safety. Pulse shape and size can be adjusted to fit the scar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63741065\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ablative and nonablative fractional laser resurfacing for the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids has been evaluated in a small number of randomized trials and uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/7,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25-27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a split-lesion trial, 25 patients with scars from surgery or trauma received three treatments with an ablative fractional 10,600 nm CO<sub>2</sub> laser at eight-week intervals in one of two selected test areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At six-month follow-up, mild improvement by physician global assessment was noted in only seven patients, with no difference between the treated and untreated areas.

Superficial burn scars responded better than deeper scars, likely due to the limited penetration depth of nonablative lasers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, side-by-side scar areas in 17 patients received three monthly nonablative fractional laser treatments or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-therapy-for-hypertrophic-scars-and-keloids/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At six months, improvement in thickness and texture without change in pigmentation was greater in the treated areas than in the control areas, as assessed by clinicians and patients. Histologic examination at six months showed collagen remodeling from thick surface-paralleled hyalinized bundles to interwoven fibers with higher vascularization and uniform density, and reduced inflammation.

(See <a href=\"#H57438650\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above and <a href=\"#H64642097\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common complications of PDL therapy include transient purpura and mild to moderate erythema or edema that resolves in 7 to 10 days. Occasionally, skin blistering or crusting may occur in the early posttreatment phase. Hypo- or hyperpigmentation may also occur, especially in patients with darker skin types. Delayed wound healing, ulceration, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and scarring may occur with fractional laser therapy.
