PVFM refers to a clinical phenomenon rather than to one specific or strictly defined clinical diagnosis. PVFM is most commonly observed as episodic unintentional adduction of the vocal folds on inspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients most often present to the emergency department with wheezing, stridor, and apparent upper airway obstruction. Delay in diagnosis is common, and unnecessary treatments such as intubation and tracheostomy are not uncommon. Patients are commonly frequent users of the health-care system, often over prolonged periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>While clinical observations of this phenomenon were described in the 1800s, they began to appear with increasing frequency in the 1970s and 1980s with the greater availability of laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. PVFM has unintentionally become a catch-all term for functional laryngeal disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, it is important to explicitly define this functional disorder as &ldquo;impaired function&rdquo;, emphasizing that this is not synonymous with a psychogenic disorder. </p><p>This topic will review the presentation and treatment of PVFM, also called laryngeal dyskinesia, vocal cord dysfunction (VCD), inspiratory adduction, periodic occurrence of laryngeal obstruction (POLO), Munchausen&rsquo;s stridor, episodic paroxysmal laryngospasm, psychogenic stridor, functional stridor, hysterical croup, emotional laryngeal wheezing, factitious asthma, pseudoasthma, and irritable larynx syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Features of wheezing illnesses other than PVFM are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing illnesses other than asthma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the normal larynx, the true vocal folds abduct (open) during inspiration and partially adduct (close) during expiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F89640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89640 \">figure 1</a>). In addition to inspiration, abduction can also be induced by sniffing and panting. Normal adduction of the true vocal folds occurs with phonation, coughing, throat clearing, swallowing, and during a Valsalva maneuver. Around 10 to 40 percent adduction is normal during expiration. Normal cough mechanics involve vocal fold adduction for 0.2 seconds following the end of the inspiratory phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM) can be seen during inspiration, expiration, or both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F89640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89640 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. The false vocal folds and supraglottic tissue may also dynamically constrict the airway. It is imperative to visualize full abduction during laryngoscopy to rule out other causes of laryngeal obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many comorbidities have been associated with paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM) as listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As PVFM is a descriptive term rather than a specific diagnosis, the etiology is often multifactorial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Occasionally, no specific inciting agent can be clearly identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9283529\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While PVFM is often misdiagnosed as asthma, PVFM can also be seen concomitantly with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In one study of asthmatics referred for a suspected diagnosis of PVFM, 75 percent had a confirmed diagnosis of PVFM on laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise-associated PVFM accounts for approximately 14 percent of PVFM diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It occurs predominantly in young female athletes who present with dyspnea and sometimes stridor triggered by exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. In a series of 831 patients with PVFM, 46 were elite athletes and of these, 70 percent were female and 46 percent were noted to have noisy breathing during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Elite athletes with PVFM were less likely to have a history of reflux, psychiatric diagnosis, dysphonia, cough, or dysphagia, compared with nonathletes who had PVFM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Postextubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It should be noted that postoperative onset of acute dyspnea and stridor is much more likely to be caused by laryngospasm rather than PVFM. Laryngospasm is usually an acute onset brief episode of sustained vocal fold adduction, often seen on emergence from general anesthesia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of postoperative pulmonary complications&quot;</a>). PVFM may occur shortly after extubation of patients who have been intubated for surgery or respiratory failure and presents with dyspnea and stridor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. The use of flexible laryngoscopy in the immediate postextubation period allows differentiation between PVFM or laryngospasm and other pulmonary etiologies of postextubation respiratory distress. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Irritants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients sometimes attribute PVFM to inhalational exposure to a variety of irritants (eg, ammonia, soldering fumes, cleaning chemicals, aerosolized machining fluids, construction dust, and smoke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The onset of PVFM symptoms typically occurs within 24 hours of the exposure. Patients may feel that ongoing problems with PVFM are related to a previous inhalational irritant exposure. While an acute exposure might cause temporary laryngeal irritation, it is unclear how a previous remote exposure would cause ongoing laryngeal irritation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9283663\"><span class=\"h2\">Laryngopharyngeal reflux</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reflux of gastric contents to the larynx and pharynx, also known as laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), is associated with PVFM. However, it is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between LPR and PVFM. Laryngoscopic findings consistent with LPR were present in 19 of 22 juveniles with confirmed PVFM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, other studies have questioned the reliability of laryngoscopy in making the diagnosis of LPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laryngopharyngeal-reflux\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laryngopharyngeal reflux&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9283669\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PVFM has been demonstrated in patients after thyroid and cervical spine surgery and in one patient after a polycranial neuropathy from herpes simplex. In this setting, the presumed etiology is aberrant reinnervation or synkinesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9283675\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial disorders and stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PVFM has been associated with a variety of psychosocial disorders. However, it is not considered to be a form of malingering as patients do not intentionally produce their condition for secondary gain. In a prospective cohort of 45 patients, 18 patients were found to have conversion disorder and 11 patients were found to have no psychopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a series of military personnel with PVFM, 52 percent reported symptoms related to high stress and anxiety, while 39 percent reported symptoms during exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>PVFM patients with a previous psychological history are prone to symptoms of depression and anxiety. Several studies have reported an association of PVFM with a history of prior psychiatric illness, including depression, personality disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, or a history of childhood sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/26,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28-31</a>]. In a case-control study comparing adolescents with PVFM to those with asthma, PVFM patients had higher levels of anxiety and more frequent diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder and separation anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious disorder imposed on self (Munchausen syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies note a female predominance, but paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM) is also well documented in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. PVFM affects all ages, occurring in the pediatric population and in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/9,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,33</a>]. The hallmark of PVFM is inspiratory stridor accompanied by respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Often the diagnosis is suspected after multiple visits to the emergency department for these episodes, or during an evaluation for severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/9,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of severe asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to dyspnea, patients may complain of throat tightness, a choking sensation, dysphonia, and cough. Less often, patients report gastroesophageal reflux, dysphagia, and rhinosinusitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/18,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,35</a>]. Onset of symptoms may be spontaneous or associated with triggers such as exercise, irritant exposure, or anxiety.</p><p>Stridor (noisy breathing) may be inspiratory, expiratory, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Stridorous sounds are usually loudest over the anterior neck and less audible through the chest wall. Typically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> has minimal to no beneficial effect. </p><p>While there is little information in the literature regarding the specific duration of PVFM episodes, episodes requiring emergency department evaluation last anywhere from several hours to several days. This distinguishes the episodes from laryngospasm which usually last seconds to a few minutes. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients with PVFM experience dysphonia during or between attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On examination this is often associated with vocal fold hyperfunction (eg, excessive false vocal fold adduction and anterior-superior laryngeal compression during phonation). There are no reports of formal voice analysis in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarseness-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarseness in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The degree of respiratory distress and anxiety of patients with PVFM can occasionally lead clinicians to perform endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy to restore airway patency before diagnostic tests are completed. Immediately afterwards, cessation of wheezing and stridor is noted, suggesting that the airflow limitation was due to an upper airway process instead of asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM). However, pulmonary function tests and imaging may be performed prior to laryngoscopy depending on the clinical presentation and degree of clinical suspicion for the diagnosis. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who report intermittent exercise-related symptoms should undergo pulmonary function tests (eg, flow volume loops, pre and postbronchodilator spirometry) to evaluate for asthma and PVFM. Laryngoscopy is then performed in patients with inspiratory slowing on the flow volume loop, poor response to medications for asthma, or a prominent report of stridor at the time of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If the diagnosis remains unclear after laryngoscopy, repeat laryngoscopy may be performed after an exercise or bronchoprovocation challenge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present to the emergency department with stridor will likely undergo laryngoscopy and possibly upper airway and chest imaging prior to pulmonary function tests. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients who have laryngoscopic evidence of PVFM, but did not have adequate subglottic visualization, may need tracheal imaging to exclude a subglottic stenosis or mass.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19239745\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with PVFM have normal expiratory spirometry, although a few have mild restrictive physiology. In contrast, the inspiratory loop of the flow-volume curve may show flattening, and the ratio of forced expiratory flow to forced inspiratory flow at 50 percent vital capacity may be &gt;1 (normal is &lt;1), consistent with extrathoracic airway obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, flow-volume loops may be normal when the patient is asymptomatic between episodes or may show expiratory airflow limitation if PVFM occurs during expiration.</p><p>PVFM can be induced with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> inhalation, presumably through an irritant mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, normal flow volume loops after methacholine do not rule out PVFM. Methacholine inhalation challenge may be most helpful in conjunction with laryngoscopy to confirm that airflow limitation is due to PVFM and not asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing#H7554031\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;, section on 'History suggestive of asthma, atypical spirometry pattern'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Laryngoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visualization of the larynx using a flexible laryngoscope is imperative to confirm abnormal adduction of the true vocal folds and to exclude other laryngeal pathology. Full visualization of the vocal folds with complete abduction is also necessary to rule out supraglottic or subglottic obstruction and bilateral vocal fold immobility. In some but not all patients, PVFM is apparent on laryngoscopy even when the patient is asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some patients may only have findings of PVFM on laryngoscopy after provocation. Tracheoscopy may be possible during flexible laryngoscopy. If tracheoscopy is not possible, a patent central airway must be confirmed by another method, such as an adequate chest x-ray or high resolution computed tomography with reconstruction.</p><p>The diagnosis of PVFM is made when laryngoscopy reveals abnormal adduction of the true folds (solely during inspiration, throughout the respiratory cycle, or rarely, solely during expiration); the glottic aperture may be obliterated except for a posterior diamond-shaped passage, as seen in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F89640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89640 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. There may also be adduction or bunching of the false vocal folds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/3,10,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,39</a>]. Although these findings are normally seen only during an acute episode, they can often be reproduced on examination when the patient is asked to mimic what happens during an attack.</p><p>It is important that the procedure is performed by an experienced laryngoscopist who is aware of this disorder to avoid misdiagnosis of bilateral true vocal fold fixation or paralysis. Normal vocal fold motion may be restored by asking the patient to cough or breathe in a panting manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9284298\"><span class=\"h2\">Provocation with exercise challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with exercise-related symptoms, resting laryngoscopy may not identify findings of inappropriate vocal fold adduction, but laryngoscopy immediately following exertion may identify the abnormality. As an example, in a series of 104 patients with exercise-related PVFM, 52 percent had no evidence of PVFM on flexible laryngoscopy at rest, but PVFM was visible on laryngoscopy after exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Exercise testing can be performed with a stationary bike, running, or stair climbing until the patient is symptomatic. Laryngoscopy can be performed immediately after exertion, when the patient is symptomatic, or in a continuous fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. We typically introduce the laryngoscope without topical anesthesia and begin recorded laryngoscopy when the patient is symptomatic. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9284162\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging is predominantly used to exclude other causes of dyspnea. Chest radiographs are often obtained in patients presenting to the emergency department to exclude an intrathoracic cause of dyspnea. If examination of the trachea is not possible during laryngoscopy, high resolution computed tomography of the upper airways can be used to exclude subglottic stenosis, tracheal and extratracheal (eg, thyroid) masses, or tracheomalacia.

In addition, pretreatment with an anticholinergic medication prior to exercise or use of inspiratory resistive training may be beneficial.

This results in dyspnea and stridor, typically inspiratory. Rarely, vocal fold adduction will be worse on expiration. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PVFM may be triggered by exercise or may occur spontaneously. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiologies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PVFM is often mistaken for asthma because it is episodic, may be brought on by exertion, and the stridor may sound similar to wheezing. Some patients have both asthma and PVFM. In asthma, however, the wheezing is typically expiratory. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow-volume curves may show flattening of the inspiratory loop consistent with extrathoracic airway obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 2</a>). Between episodes, spirometry is often normal. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is confirmed by flexible laryngoscopy during an episode by visualization of abnormal adduction of the vocal folds and exclusion of other causes of glottic and subglottic obstruction. In some patients, the glottic aperture may be obliterated during inspiration except for a posterior diamond-shaped passage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F89640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89640 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of PVFM includes asthma, angioedema, bilateral vocal fold palsy, glottic and tracheal neoplasms or stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, and laryngospasm. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with an acute episode of PVFM, we suggest initially using a combination of reassurance and panting maneuvers (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If this is not effective, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be helpful; inhalation of a helium-oxygen mixture would be another alternative. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with recurrent PVFM, we suggest a long-term management strategy that combines speech therapy, psychological counseling, and avoidance of perceived laryngeal irritants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with exercise-related PVFM may benefit from using an inhaled anticholinergic agent prior to exercise. When PVFM coexists with asthma, medications for asthma should be continued during treatment for PVFM.
