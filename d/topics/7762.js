People who have Gilbert syndrome were born with it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274306\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Gilbert syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often, Gilbert syndrome does not cause any symptoms. If it does, the most common symptom is jaundice. Jaundice makes the skin or whites of the eyes look yellow.</p><p>Jaundice is common in newborn babies. Babies with Gilbert syndrome might have jaundice longer or worse than other babies, but doctors can treat it. In people with Gilbert syndrome, jaundice can be triggered by a fever, physical effort such as hard exercise, stress, or not eating.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274321\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Gilbert syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can do different blood tests to see if you have Gilbert syndrome. In some cases, he or she can also order a test to check whether you have the gene that causes Gilbert syndrome. But the gene test is not usually needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274336\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Gilbert syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gilbert syndrome does not need treatment. The jaundice goes away on its own, and does not usually cause health problems.</p><p>If you have Gilbert syndrome, tell all your doctors and nurses that you have it. Also tell them about all the medicines you take, including over-the-counter and herbal medicines. Your doctors and nurses need to know about your condition when deciding on medicines for you, because people with Gilbert syndrome can have worse side effects from certain medicines than other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274350\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Jaundice in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Jaundice in babies (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gilbert-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gilbert syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-newborn-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Jaundice in newborn infants (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
