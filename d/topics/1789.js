These include hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemia, hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (the source of renin in the kidney), and hyperaldosteronism. Some patients also have hypomagnesemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).</p><p>The hyperaldosteronism associated with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes is a secondary form of hyperaldosteronism that results from a volume contraction-induced increase in renin.

In a report from the Framingham Heart Study, the prevalence of Gitelman syndrome was 1 in 40,000 compared with 1 in 1,000,000 for Bartter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The lower prevalence of Bartter syndrome in the population may be due at least in part to prenatal or neonatal death resulting from the disorder before it could be diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The estimated prevalence of heterozygotes with one of the genetic mutations that cause these disorders is at least 1 percent in Western countries; in Asia, the prevalence of mutations may be as high as 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The salt wasting that occurs results in the following features common to patients with both disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired sodium chloride reabsorption leads to volume depletion (usually mild but sometimes severe) and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of secondary hyperaldosteronism and increased distal flow and sodium delivery enhances potassium and hydrogen secretion at the secretory sites in the connecting tubules and collecting tubules, leading to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. (See <a href=\"#H168860066\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion of other causes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes, as well as heterozygotes of both disorders, have a lower blood pressure than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition to volume depletion, another possible contributor to a lower blood pressure in Bartter syndrome is increased renal release of vasodilator prostaglandins (prostaglandin E2 [PGE2]). (See <a href=\"#H3869754\" class=\"local\">'Role of prostaglandins'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diluting capacity is reduced in patients with both disorders because maximal dilution of the urine requires intact function of both the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal tubule. In normal individuals, sodium chloride is reabsorbed without water in both sites, and, if antidiuretic hormone&nbsp;(ADH) is suppressed, maximal urine dilution occurs.</p><p/><p>However, there are distinctive features that correspond to the tubular location of disrupted sodium chloride reabsorption (ie, loop of Henle in Bartter syndrome and distal tubule in Gitelman syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68035 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Bartter syndrome tend to have a blunted response to a loop diuretic, while patients with Gitelman syndrome tend to have a blunted response to a thiazide diuretic.

Maximal urine concentration requires intact function of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and maximal ADH activity, but it is not substantially impaired by the reduced distal tubule function in patients with Gitelman syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary calcium excretion is normal or high in patients with Bartter syndrome, as it is with a loop diuretic, since calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb requires normal sodium chloride reabsorption. By contrast, urinary calcium excretion is typically reduced in patients with Gitelman syndrome as it is with a thiazide diuretic.

Volume depletion leads to secondary hyperaldosteronism; this, along with increased distal flow and delivery of sodium, results in increased urinary potassium losses and hydrogen ion secretion.</p><p>Sodium chloride reabsorption without water in the loop of Henle plays a central role in creating the medullary concentration gradient that is required for excretion of maximally concentrated urine in the presence of ADH. The impaired concentrating ability and polyuria in Bartter syndrome are mainly due to the impaired sodium transport in the loop of Henle. High prostaglandin levels and chronic hypokalemia may also contribute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemia'</a>.)</p><p>Urinary dilution is also impaired since sodium chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle reduces the osmolality of the tubular fluid and, in the absence of ADH, contributes to the excretion of dilute urine.</p><p>In addition, the paracellular reabsorption of both calcium and magnesium in the thick ascending limb requires the electrochemical gradient created by sodium chloride transport in this tubule segment. Thus, abnormal sodium chloride transport in the thick ascending limb increases renal calcium and magnesium excretion. As a result, urinary calcium excretion is normal or increased, and hypomagnesemia often develops (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75301 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396471898\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The various genetic defects that cause Bartter syndrome reduce the activity of one of several electrolyte transporters in the thick ascending limb. To understand how altered function of these various transporters can result in the clinical features of Bartter syndrome, the physiology of transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop will be briefly reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75301 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The following sequence summarizes normal ion transport in the medullary thick ascending limb:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The energy for sodium chloride reabsorption throughout the nephron is generated by Na-K ATPase, which reduces the intracellular sodium concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resulting sodium gradient from lumen to intracellular fluid drives the simultaneous reabsorption of one sodium, one potassium, and two chloride ions via the Na-K-2Cl (NKCC2) (loop diuretic-sensitive) cotransporter that is present in the luminal membrane. Ion reabsorption by the cotransporter is electroneutral.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large fraction of the absorbed potassium reenters the lumen via potassium channels (ROMK). This generates a lumen-positive electrical charge, which drives passive paracellular sodium, calcium, and magnesium reabsorption, and also provides potassium for continued Na-K-2Cl cotransport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p/><p>Several different basolateral chloride channels play a role in chloride reabsorption. The most important chloride channel in the basolateral membrane of the medullary thick ascending limb is Cl-channel kidney B (ClC-Kb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another chloride channel, Cl-channel kidney A (ClC-Ka), may have redundant functionality. A small protein beta-subunit, named barttin, must interact with each of these chloride channels for them to function appropriately. These chloride channels also play an important role in ion transport in the ear, accounting for the association between some genetic renal transport defects and deafness. Neurosensory deafness can be a rare complication of Bartter syndrome when it is caused by specific mutations.

The major clinical manifestation of this class of Bartter syndrome is hypocalcemia, and the disorder is also called autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H88846693\" class=\"local\">'Type V'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88846686\"><span class=\"h4\">Types I through IV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity and clinical presentation of Bartter syndrome varies with each type:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types I and II are usually severe disorders that cause polyhydramnios during pregnancy and prematurity. Those who survive infancy develop hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, polyuria, and hypercalciuria. Neonates with type II mutations that reduce activity of the ROMK channel often initially develop hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, as they mature, other potassium channels become active and contribute to the development of hypokalemia. Nephrocalcinosis is common in patients with these mutations and probably contributes to the late development of kidney dysfunction and, rarely, end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic form of Bartter syndrome, type III, is less severe and presents later in life with hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria. The reduced severity of type III Bartter syndrome may be due to redundancy of chloride channels in the cells of the thick ascending limb. Loss of ClC-Kb activity causes the disease, but coexistent ClC-Ka activity may ameliorate the process. Some patients with ClC-Kb mutations have one or more features of Gitelman syndrome including hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria (not hypercalciuria), and unresponsiveness to thiazide rather than loop diuretics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30</a>]. This may be seen because ClC-Kb participates in chloride reabsorption along the distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule, as well as the thick ascending limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Many of the mutations that cause Bartter syndrome type III destabilize the channel structure, induce ClC-Kb retention within the endoplasmic reticulum, and accelerate channel degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H168860094\" class=\"local\">'Response to thiazide and loop diuretics'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Late manifestations that have been described in type III Bartter syndrome include proteinuria and impaired kidney function, which were detected in one series at a median follow-up of 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Kidney function may deteriorate secondary to nephrocalcinosis and from the adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See <a href=\"#H53268858\" class=\"local\">'NSAIDs and drugs that block distal tubule sodium-potassium exchange'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types IV and IVb have combined defects that involve both the ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels and cause severe disease, generally with antenatal presentation and congenital hearing loss. These two chloride channels are critical for normal ion transport in the stria vascularis of the inner ear and are vital to establish normal endocochlear potential differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-38</a>]. Because of redundancy of function in the ear, hearing loss requires defects to exist in both ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb. This double defect can occur via at least two mechanisms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>As discussed above, the barttin subunit is a critical component of both channels. Thus, a single defect that affects the barttin subunit reduces the function of both channels (type IV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The other mechanism involves double mutations, which reduce the function of both ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb and thereby produce a phenotype similar to the barttin type IV defect. This is generally called Bartter type IVb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Although some have called this variant &quot;Bartter type V disease,&quot; the designation &quot;type V Bartter disease&quot; is most commonly used to describe a gain-of-function mutation in the CaSR (as described in the next section).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with type IV or type IVb Bartter syndrome develop nephrocalcinosis less commonly than those with other Bartter subtypes. However, they more often develop progressive kidney dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88846693\"><span class=\"h4\">Type V</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type V, usually called autosomal dominant hypocalcemia or autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism, is due to a gain-of-function mutation in the CaSR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. In the parathyroid gland, this results in a downward &quot;resetting&quot; of the normal range for serum calcium. As a result, a lower-than-normal serum calcium concentration inhibits parathyroid hormone release, resulting in hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia&quot;, section on 'Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia'</a>.)</p><p>The CaSR is also expressed in the basolateral membrane of the thick ascending limb where it is involved in the regulation of renal calcium transport and sodium chloride reabsorption. Activation of the CaSR blunts potassium efflux through the ROMK channel and also may reduce activity of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75301 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/4,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,40,42</a>]. Some patients have gain-of-function mutations in the CaSR that are severe enough to produce mild to moderate renal sodium chloride wasting, which leads to volume contraction and increased aldosterone and renin levels. Renal potassium wasting, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis ensue, creating a phenotype similar to Bartter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/26,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,41</a>].

The reason for this observation is not known, but it may relate to prolonged exposure to elevated renin and aldosterone levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some but not all series have found more severe potassium wasting in women as well as an increased need for potassium and magnesium replacement during pregnancy.

This was illustrated in a study of five patients from two unrelated families with the same mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Two men, who were the probands in each family, had marked symptomatic hypokalemia (1.6 and 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> normal serum magnesium concentrations, normal calcium excretion rates, and impaired maximal renal concentrating ability (Bartter phenotype), while three women had less severe and asymptomatic hypokalemia (2.8, 2.6, and 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, and intact maximal renal concentrating ability (Gitelman phenotype).</p><p>Although classic Gitelman syndrome is caused by mutations that reduce transport by NCC, other transporter defects can also generate a Gitelman phenotype. As an example, the ClC-Kb chloride channel is present in the thick ascending limb and also throughout the distal tubule. Mutations in this channel usually cause type III Bartter syndrome (see <a href=\"#H88846686\" class=\"local\">'Types I through IV'</a> above). However, in some patients, mutations in this chloride channel produce the clinical features of Gitelman syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/26,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,63,64</a>]. The following observations have been noted in different families with ClC-Kb mutations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phenotype that is a hybrid between Bartter and Gitelman syndromes or that evolves over time from Bartter syndrome to Gitelman syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identical mutations in the gene directing ClC-Kb synthesis that can produce either classic Gitelman syndrome or classic Bartter syndrome within the same family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]</p><p/><p>It is possible that the observed clinical variability is the result of differences in function or expression of other basolateral chloride transporters (such as the KCl cotransporter, ClC-Ka, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or the voltage-gated chloride channel) or to variable modulation of these transporters by regulatory kinase cascades. However, the specific explanation remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/26,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3869754\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of prostaglandins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal PGE2 production is often markedly elevated in the types of Bartter syndrome characterized by severe symptoms and presentation in utero or in the neonate (types I, II, IV, and IVb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. The increased renal production of PGE2 results from impaired entry of sodium chloride into the macula densa cells at the end of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This increases the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. PGE2 levels are also increased by loop diuretics, which have an effect similar to the defect in Bartter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>PGE2 directly stimulates renin release from juxtaglomerular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/65,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,68,69</a>] and contributes to the electrolyte abnormalities that are seen in Bartter syndrome. This is clinically important since inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (NSAIDs) can reverse many of the clinical and laboratory abnormalities of Bartter syndrome with the exception of the impairment in sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H168860108\" class=\"local\">'Primary therapeutic approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>Prostaglandin excretion is normal or slightly increased in patients with Gitelman syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. This parallels the minor changes in prostaglandin excretion generated by thiazide diuretics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. It has therefore been assumed that pharmacologic prostaglandin inhibition would be much less useful in this group of patients. However, as discussed above, the genetic and clinical spectrum of these renal tubule salt-wasting disorders is broad, and prostaglandin excretion is elevated in some patients with apparent Gitelman disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> may therefore be useful in some patients with Gitelman disease. This has been demonstrated in an open-label, randomized crossover study comparing the efficacy and safety of six weeks of daily 75 mg slow-release indomethacin, 150 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>, or 20 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> added to constant potassium and magnesium supplementation in 30 patients with Gitelman syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3869761\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations in heterozygotes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most forms of Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are autosomal recessive diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. This has led to speculation about the phenotypes of heterozygotes that carry these mutations, which are estimated to be present in at least 1 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The heterozygous mice had no abnormalities in blood pressure or fluid balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The normal phenotype was probably due, at least in part, to posttranscriptional compensation for the defect, which resulted in near-normal levels and cellular distribution of the NKCC2 cotransporter. These findings suggest that genetic carriers of mutations in the loop diuretic-sensitive cotransporter are unlikely to exhibit significant clinical abnormalities, although subtle abnormalities remain possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 65 patients with genetically defined hypokalemic salt-losing nephropathies included seven patients who had hypocalciuria and were heterozygous for mutations in the NCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

This is probably due to self-selected higher salt intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Although Gitelman and Bartter syndrome are salt-wasting disorders, initial volume loss leads to hormonal adaptations (increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and reduced release of natriuretic peptides) that restore the balance between salt intake and excretion and prevent further losses. A similar sequence occurs with thiazide diuretics used to treat hypertension. Salt wasting is transient, and a steady state (with restoration of balance between sodium intake and excretion) is achieved at a lower extracellular fluid volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74940 \">figure 3</a>).

In such patients, the presence of Bartter or Gitelman syndrome can be diagnosed after other, more common causes of unexplained hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis have been excluded. Excluding these other causes includes a careful history, thorough physical examination, measurement of the urine chloride concentration (or fractional chloride excretion), and urine diuretic screens. (See <a href=\"#H168860066\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion of other causes'</a> below.)</p><p>If this evaluation for other causes is negative and is therefore consistent with an inherited tubulopathy, then the likelihood that the patient has Bartter or Gitelman syndrome is high; therapy is often initiated in such patients with a likely diagnosis. However, some series that employed genetic testing found that a clinical diagnosis of Bartter or Gitelman syndrome may sometimes be incorrect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, patients and their families often seek a definitive diagnosis, genetic counselling in confirmed cases may be desired, and the costs of genetic testing are decreasing. For these reasons, genetic testing for specific mutations is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H168859978\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Other tests, such as measurement of the change in fractional excretion of chloride in response to loop and thiazide diuretics, are <strong>not</strong> widely performed and can be dangerous.

Urine calcium excretion is high-normal or elevated in Bartter syndrome and below normal in Gitelman syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The range of normal values for these measurements is wide and varies with age and body weight. In addition, the urine <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/creatinine</span> ratio in a given individual can vary with the urine osmolality and, for unclear reasons, with both the urine and serum concentrations of magnesium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In normal adults, the upper limit for 24-hour urinary calcium excretion is approximately 275 mg (6.9 mmol) in women and 300 mg (7.5 mmol) in men.

The most common disorders that have a similar presentation and must be excluded are surreptitious vomiting and surreptitious diuretic use. Frequently, patients have both surreptitious vomiting and diuretic abuse. Clinical clues often suggest one these disorders.

Sodium (and bicarbonate) is excreted in the urine during the early phase of vomiting and then recurs intermittently because the hypovolemic stimulus to retain sodium can be counteracted by the excretion of sodium (and potassium) bicarbonate when the serum bicarbonate level increases rapidly and exceeds its renal threshold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63175\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63175 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].

The urine chloride concentration is highly variable in diuretic abusers. It is elevated when diuretic activity is present and then appropriately low when the diuretic effect wears off. A marked specimen-to-specimen variability in urine chloride suggests intermittent diuretic use. By contrast, daily urine chloride excretion is equal to intake, and its spot concentration is usually persistently greater than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in Bartter and Gitelman syndromes.
