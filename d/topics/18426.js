Diabetes is a disorder that disrupts the way a person's body uses sugar. This causes sugar to build up in the blood. Insulin can lower a person's blood sugar level. Insulin usually comes in the form of a shot that a person gives to herself or himself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080434\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. All types of insulin can control blood sugar levels. But some types of insulin start working faster or last longer than other types. Many people use 2 different types of insulin each day so that their body has insulin all day and night.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080441\"><span class=\"h1\">How many times a day should I use insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends. Your doctor will work with you to make a treatment plan that tells you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When to use insulin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of insulin to use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much insulin to use</p><p/><p>Some people use the same amount of insulin 1 or 2 times a day, at the same time each day. But many people use insulin 3 or more times a day, usually before each meal. Using insulin 3 or more times a day can control a person's blood sugar level better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080448\"><span class=\"h1\">How much insulin should I use?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes, people need to choose their dose of insulin. When choosing how much insulin to use, people need to think about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What they plan to eat at the next meal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much exercise they plan to do</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What their blood sugar level is</p><p/><p>People also usually need to change their insulin dose if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have surgery, get sick, or get pregnant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat out or travel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gain or lose weight</p><p/><p>Ask your doctor or nurse how to change your insulin dose during these times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080455\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I give myself an insulin shot?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to give yourself an insulin shot. You will need either a prefilled insulin pen injector or a needle and syringe to draw up insulin from a small bottle.</p><p>The pen injectors are easier to use than the older syringes and insulin bottles. They have prefilled insulin cartridges and a needle. There is a knob at the end of the pen, which you can turn to mark the number of units you need to take.</p><p>If you use a bottle and syringe, be sure you are using the correct syringe for your type of insulin. Using the wrong syringe with your insulin can cause a dangerous insulin overdose.</p><p>Whether you are using an injector pen or a syringe, the way you give yourself the insulin shot is the same. Here's what you do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose a part of the body &ndash; People can use different parts of the body for an insulin shot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74635\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74635 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pinch up some skin and quickly insert the needle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80789\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80789 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Push the plunger down all the way and count to 5</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let go of the skin and remove the needle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw out the needle (and syringe, if you are using one) in a container that is made for used needles</p><p/><p>You should never use another person's insulin pen &ndash; even if the needle is changed &ndash; or let another person use yours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080462\"><span class=\"h1\">What is an insulin pump?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An insulin pump is a device that slowly releases insulin into the body. The insulin goes through a thin tube from the pump into the body through an opening in the skin. The device keeps working all day and night.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9191602\"><span class=\"h1\">What is inhaled insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-insulin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Inhaled insulin</a> is an insulin powder that is breathed into the lungs. The insulin powder comes in a cartridge that can be placed into a small inhaler (like an asthma inhaler). The inhaler is placed in the mouth and when you breathe in, the powdered insulin goes into the lungs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080469\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I am using the right amount of insulin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To know if you are using the right amount of insulin, you can check your blood sugar level at home. Most doctors recommend that people who use insulin check their blood sugar level at least 4 times a day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080476\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do I need to check my blood sugar level?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Checking your blood sugar level is important because it can tell you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your blood sugar level gets too low or too high &ndash; If you use too much insulin, your blood sugar level can get too low. If you do not use enough insulin, your blood sugar level can get too high. Levels that are too low or too high can lead to serious problems. Talk with your doctor or nurse about what to do if your blood sugar level gets too low or too high.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What changes to make in your next insulin dose &ndash; Knowing your blood sugar level will help you choose your next insulin dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well your treatment is working &ndash; One goal of diabetes treatment is to keep your blood sugar at or near a normal level. This can prevent health problems later in life.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080483\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I check my blood sugar level at home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can use a device called a &quot;blood glucose monitor&quot; to check your blood sugar level. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use your blood glucose monitor.</p><p>Most blood glucose monitors work the same way. You will need to prick your skin to get a drop of blood. Many people prick their fingertips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57918\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57918 \">picture 1</a>), but you can prick other parts of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63375\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63375 \">picture 2</a>). Then you will put the drop of blood into the monitor. After a few seconds, the monitor will show your blood sugar level.</p><p>Some people use a device that measures the blood sugar all the time. This is called &quot;continuous monitoring.&quot; The person wears a special sensor that attaches to the skin with a sticky patch. It measures blood sugar and sends the information to a small box that can attach to clothing or go in a bag. People who have continuous monitoring still need to check their blood sugar by pricking their skin several times a day. This is to make sure the monitoring device is working correctly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667080490\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-blood-sugar-in-people-with-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low blood sugar in people with diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=keeping-your-childs-blood-sugar-under-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Keeping your child's blood sugar under control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=checking-your-childs-blood-sugar-level-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Checking your child's blood sugar level (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=should-i-switch-to-an-insulin-pump-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Should I switch to an insulin pump?
