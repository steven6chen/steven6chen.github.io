In patients with PPH who have had a vaginal birth or whose cesarean delivery has been completed, medical and minimally invasive approaches are the preferred treatment approaches; laparotomy is generally a last resort that is performed when less invasive interventions have failed. During cesarean delivery, uterotonic drugs and manual uterine massage and compression are still the initial treatments for bleeding due to atony, but uterine compression sutures and other operative interventions for control of hemorrhage are performed sooner since the abdomen is already open.</p><p>This topic will discuss treatment approaches to PPH that require laparotomy. Medical and minimally invasive management of patients with PPH is reviewed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;</a>). An overview of issues related to PPH: incidence, pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation and diagnosis, general principles of planning and management, morbidity and mortality, and recurrence, is also available separately.

In patients at or post cesarean delivery, the existing incision is used, and extended if needed to provide adequate exposure. </p><p>A self-retaining retractor, such as a Balfour or Bookwalter, provides adequate lateral exposure. A posterior rupture is not readily visualized upon entering the abdomen so the entire uterus needs to be inspected carefully. </p><p>At laparotomy, the abdominal cavity is irrigated to remove blood and clots and inspected for the source of bleeding. The source of bleeding is usually readily apparent if pelvic, but may not be immediately recognized when it is retroperitoneal (including vaginal and vulvar hematomas), confined to the uterine cavity after vaginal delivery or after closure of the uterine incision at cesarean, or under surgical drapes. These sites should be actively evaluated in patients with compensated shock (normal blood pressure with increasing heart rate). </p><p>Intra-abdominal blood without an obvious uterine rupture or bleeding vessel may be due to hepatic or splenic rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;, section on 'Hepatic hematoma and rupture'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Splenic rupture'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100826418\"><span class=\"h1\">TEMPORARY MEASURES FOR STABILIZING HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe bleeding often continues while the surgeon is preparing to perform and performing surgical procedures for controlling hemorrhage. Temporizing maneuvers should be attempted prior to performing any surgical procedures, such as opening the retroperitoneum, which will take significant time before the source of bleeding is identified <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> controlled. Even the most simple-appearing hysterectomy in a patient with severe coagulopathy can be very difficult once the pelvis or retroperitoneum fills with blood and structures that were not bleeding start to bleed. </p><p>The following measures, in addition to fluid administration and transfusion of blood products, help to support the patient hemodynamically in preparation for and during surgical evaluation and treatment, and can be life-saving. The option chosen depends on the urgency to control bleeding, the source of bleeding (intrauterine versus extrauterine), and the surgeon's expertise and preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4094108123\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients at imminent risk of exsanguination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1412272996\"><span class=\"h3\">Manual aortic compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there is an imminent threat of exsanguination (ie, within a few minutes), the surgeon should compress the aorta against the vertebrae a few centimeters superior to the sacral promontory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115271 \">figure 1</a>); the bifurcation into the common iliac arteries is just distal to this point. Alternatively, the aorta can be compressed just below the renal arteries, which will minimize collateral flow to the uterus from the ovarian and inferior mesenteric arteries. Compression at either site will slow the volume of bleeding and will afford a better opportunity for finding and controlling the source of hemorrhage. Compression just above the bifurcation may be easier to accomplish, but is less effective than below the renal arteries because of the extensive collateral blood supply to the uterus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3982100246\"><span class=\"h3\">Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ultrasound directed, aortic balloon placement technique has been used in trauma (military and civilian) and emergency room settings. Minimal data on the use of this technique in obstetrics are available, but suggest that in desperate situations, particularly in low-resource environments where interventional radiology and blood banking are unavailable, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) by appropriately trained obstetricians may offer a minimally invasive approach to&nbsp;resuscitation. It may also be used prophylactically&nbsp;before surgery in women with a morbidly adherent placenta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3839938707\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermittent intraaortic balloon occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraaortic balloon catheters have been used intraoperatively to stabilize patients in extreme emergencies where death from exsanguination is imminent, but evidence of safety and efficacy is limited to case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>A balloon catheter can be placed directly into the aorta at the bifurcation using a Seldinger technique (initial needle followed by a guidewire over which the balloon catheter is inserted). The catheter is advanced up the aorta and the balloon is positioned below the renal arteries and above the ovarian and inferior mesenteric arteries under direct vision and palpation, and then inflated. This position should ensure substantial reduction in uterine blood flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115271 \">figure 1</a>). As discussed above, placing the intraaortic balloon just above the aortic bifurcation may not substantially reduce uterine blood flow because of the extensive collateral blood supply to the uterus. For example, the ovarian arteries supply the uterus via the utero-ovarian branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F99540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99540 \">figure 2</a>); therefore, if the ovarian arteries are not occluded, then uterine blood flow may not be substantially reduced despite uterine artery, and even internal iliac artery, ligation. Similarly, the inferior mesenteric artery is continuous with the uterine arterial collateral system via the superior rectal artery and its posterior collaterals (lumbar and median sacral arteries); therefore, uterine blood flow may not be substantially reduced if the inferior mesenteric artery is not occluded.</p><p>When the patient has been resuscitated, the balloon is deflated intermittently to prevent ischemic limb or colon complications from aortic occlusion, and distal pulses are monitored frequently. Consultation with a vascular surgeon is recommended, especially prior to removal of the catheter in&nbsp;case repair of the insertion site is needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3964132429\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients at nonimminent risk of exsanguination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100826424\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine tourniquet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tourniquets have been used to control bleeding at myomectomy, and for other types of uterine hemorrhage, and may be useful as a temporizing measure in PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. A Penrose drain or urinary catheter is placed as low as possible around the lower uterine segment without incorporating the urinary bladder, and then the two ends are pulled in opposite directions and as tightly as possible around the corpus to mechanically occlude the vascular supply. A second or third tourniquet can also be applied, as needed. The tourniquet can be held in place with a clamp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113917 \">figure 3</a>). This procedure markedly reduces blood loss and allows time for the anesthesia team members to catch up with transfusion requirements. When the patient is hemodynamically stable, the tourniquet is removed and the surgical procedure is completed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy#H1388953\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques to reduce blood loss during abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy&quot;, section on 'Tourniquets and clamps'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056649914\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrauterine balloon tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercially available and improvised devices have been used successfully to tamponade bleeding from the uterine cavity after vaginal or cesarean delivery. For each device, the intrauterine balloon is filled until bleeding is controlled; continued excessive bleeding indicates that tamponade is not effective. Intrauterine balloon tamponade has been used alone and in combination with uterine compression sutures (&quot;uterine sandwich&quot;). The technique is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-balloon-tamponade-for-control-of-postpartum-hemorrhage#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine balloon tamponade for control of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'After cesarean delivery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295115216\"><span class=\"h3\">Ligation of uterine and utero-ovarian arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ligation of the uterine and utero-ovarian arteries can decrease uterine bleeding by reducing perfusion pressure in the myometrium. It will not control bleeding from uterine atony or placenta accreta, but may decrease blood loss while other interventions are being attempted. It does not harm the uterus and does not appear to impact reproductive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

It can be useful as a temporizing measure in the management of broad ligament or retroperitoneal hematomas, lacerations that are difficult to repair because of their location or friable tissue, bleeding related to coagulopathy while coagulation factors are being replaced, and posthysterectomy bleeding. The technique is described below.

Successful and safe bilateral hypogastric ligation becomes even more difficult when attempted by a surgeon who rarely operates deep in the pelvic retroperitoneal space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For these reasons, uterine compression sutures, uterine artery ligation, and arterial embolization have largely replaced this procedure. </p><p>Bilateral ligation of the internal iliac arteries (hypogastric arteries) reduces the pulse pressure of blood flowing to the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The utility of the procedure may be compromised when there are extensive collateral vessels (such as in placenta percreta). Reverse filling of the internal iliac arteries has been reported beyond the point of ligation via branches of the external iliac artery (inferior epigastric, obturator, deep circumflex iliac, and superior gluteal arteries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>A technical description of the procedure is available separately.

Intraoperative cell salvage may be arranged before laparotomy or requested during laparotomy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has acknowledged the safety and efficacy of intraoperative cell salvage in patients with PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Institutions who offer reinfusion of salvaged blood should have designated personnel, which may include cross-trained operating room employee (eg, an anesthesia technician) or a member of a specialist service (eg, an extracorporeal technologist or perfusionist), who are called to manage this equipment and who follow written policies and procedures for proper collection, labeling, and storage of the collected blood. </p><p>Autotransfusion of blood obtained by intraoperative cell salvage (with a leukocyte filter and washing) can reduce the use of allogeneic blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/11,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15-19</a>]. Although there is a theoretical concern that reinfusing amniotic fluid may cause amniotic fluid embolism, this has been documented only once [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and may have been prevented with washing. Risk of maternal infection from infusion of bacterial contamination is also minimal. Salvaged blood may contain fetal erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but this is not a major concern, as Rh(D) alloimmunization in an Rh(D)-negative mother can be prevented by administration of anti-D immunoglobulin. ABO incompatibility reactions cannot be prevented, but are unlikely to be serious because the volume of fetal blood contamination is small and A and B <span class=\"nowrap\">antigens/antibodies</span> are not fully developed at birth. These risks are probably less than or similar to those from allogeneic transfusion. </p><p>There are data in obstetric patients that cell salvage is a potential source of a substantial volume of blood for transfusion and reduces the need for allogenic transfusion. In a study of patients with obstetric hemorrhage in whom intraoperative blood salvage was performed and the blood was reinfused, the mean&plusmn;standard deviation number of reinfused shed blood units was 1.2&plusmn;1.1 units, and at least three patients received 4, 5, or 8 reinfused shed blood units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Another group estimated that the use of cell salvage for obstetric hemorrhage saved, on average, 0.68 units of allogeneic packed erythrocytes per patient (95% CI 0.49-0.88), translating to a 32 percent reduction in the use of allogeneic packed erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Technical issues of cell salvage are reviewed in detail separately.

Clinicians should use their clinical judgment in deciding whether to expend time attempting conservative interventions in a patient with severe hemorrhage who may be better served by hysterectomy, such as women with a morbidly adherent placenta or uterine rupture. </p><p>Cessation of hemorrhage depends on reversal of any coagulopathy, so every effort should be made to reverse contributing factors such as hypothermia, acidosis, and lack of clotting factors. Even if bleeding cannot be completely controlled initially, as long as more blood and blood products are infused than lost, hemodynamic stability can be achieved and maintained.

Bleeding from a hysterotomy incision can generally be controlled by suture ligation. The angles of a transverse incision should be clearly visualized to ensure that they, and any retracted vessels, are completely ligated. This generally requires exteriorization of the uterus with gentle traction and adequate lateral retraction. </p><p>Given the proximity of the ureter to the vaginal angle and bladder reflection, placement of hemostatic sutures laterally to control bleeding from an extension of a hysterotomy laceration should be carried out with extreme caution. If possible, the ipsilateral ureter should be identified before the bleeding is controlled and, once the hemorrhage has been controlled, the integrity of the ureter should be ensured. (See <a href=\"#H1674299558\" class=\"local\">'Post-laparotomy inspection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laceration of the uterine artery or utero-ovarian artery branches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral ligation of the uterine vessels (O'Leary stitch) is the preferred approach for controlling PPH from laceration of the uterine artery or branches of the utero-ovarian artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. It is preferable to internal iliac artery ligation because the uterine arteries are more readily accessible, the procedure is technically easier, and there is less risk to major adjacent vessels and the ureters. (See <a href=\"#H2326775864\" class=\"local\">'Role of internal iliac artery ligation'</a> above.)</p><p>After identification of the ureter, a large curved needle with a #0 polyglycolic acid suture is passed through the lateral aspect of the lower uterine segment as close to the cervix as possible and then back through the broad ligament just lateral to the uterine vessels. If this does not control bleeding, the vessels of the utero-ovarian arcade are similarly ligated just distal to the cornua by passing a suture ligature through the myometrium just medial to the vessels, then back through the broad ligament just lateral to the vessels, and then tying to compress the vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77881\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77881 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>Bilateral ligation of the arteries and veins (uterine and utero-ovarian) is successful in controlling hemorrhage in over 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] and does not appear affect future reproductive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Regardless of the etiology of PPH, continued blood loss can lead to severe coagulopathy due to massive loss of coagulation factors. Severe hypovolemia, tissue hypoxia, hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities, and acidosis can result, which further compromise the patient's status. If the patient is not already at laparotomy and has developed these additional complications, then correction of the severe physiological deficits before hysterectomy, if possible, could be life-saving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

Once the patient is resuscitated and the coagulopathy is reversed, hysterectomy may no longer be required to control hemorrhage.

Criteria proposed for this &quot;in extremis&quot; state include pH &lt;7.30, temperature &lt;35&deg;C, combined resuscitation and procedural time &gt;90 minutes, nonmechanical bleeding, and transfusion requirement &gt;10 units packed red blood cells (RBCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>To abort the cycle, the bleeding area is tightly packed and the skin is closed to prevent heat and moisture loss (either with large sutures or with towel clamps). Under most circumstances, the patient should remain in the operating room with continuous monitoring, while replacement of appropriate blood products and correction of physiologic derangements (&quot;damage control&quot;) occurs. Once stable and safe for transfer, the patient may be transferred to the intensive care unit for ongoing management until definitive surgery can be performed. This approach halts the downward spiral and lessens the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome is more difficult to define postpartum since postcesarean intra-abdominal pressure appears to be higher than in the general surgical population, especially in women with elevated body mass index and hypertensive disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

The free end of the gauze train is extracorporealized through the main incision. The peritoneum, muscle, and fascia are closed in the usual fashion, but with the gauze protruding from one end of the incision. The subcutaneous and cutaneous layers are left open and packed with additional gauze.</p><p>Different surgeons practice slight variations of this procedure (&quot;umbrella pack&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/57-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-65</a>]. One variation is to fill a sterile plastic bag (eg, drawstring bag used to cover x-ray film) or cloth container with gauze and place it against the pelvic bleeders. The drawstrings are pulled through the vagina and attached to a weight, which provides traction so that the pack exerts pressure against the pelvic floor. A balloon tamponade device has also been used as a pelvic pressure pack after hysterectomy for PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>The need for &ge;2 units packed RBCs per hour for three hours is a sign of significant ongoing bleeding and need for surgical intervention or arterial embolization by an interventional radiologist. Placement of a large bore drainage catheter (such as a large Jackson-Pratt drain or a chest tube) in the pelvis at the time of temporary closure will allow early recognition of the need for emergency re-laparotomy.</p><p>Otherwise, the patient is returned to the operating room to undergo definitive surgical care in 48 hours. Packing should not be removed until coagulation defects have been corrected. If the packing has controlled bleeding, it generally is removed at this time. If it is removed too soon, bleeding will resume, whereas if it is removed too late, pelvic infection or abscess may ensue.</p><p>Under general anesthesia, the wound is opened and the gauze is removed with gentle traction. The pelvis is irrigated with saline to clear loose clots and other debris, but aggressive exploration of the pelvis is not performed if no pooling of blood is noted.
