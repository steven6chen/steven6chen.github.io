The diagnosis is usually first suspected because of the incidental finding of an elevated serum calcium concentration on biochemical screening tests. In addition, PHPT may be suspected in a patient with nephrolithiasis.</p><p>If hypercalcemia is confirmed, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) should be measured concomitantly with the serum calcium. PHPT is diagnosed by finding a frankly elevated PTH concentration in a patient with hypercalcemia. When the PTH is only minimally elevated or within the normal range (but inappropriately normal given the patient's hypercalcemia), PHPT remains the most likely diagnosis, although familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), a rare disorder, is possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50252\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50252 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F104081\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104081 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3563575\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism is a variant of PHPT, first recognized in 2009 by an international panel of experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism typically come to medical attention in the setting of an evaluation for low bone mineral density (BMD), during which time PTH levels are drawn and found to be elevated in the absence of hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In order to make a diagnosis of normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, certain conditions must be met. In particular, all secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73157 \">table 2</a>) must be ruled out, and ionized calcium levels should be normal. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism versus secondary hyperparathyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3563575\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single elevated serum calcium concentration should be repeated to confirm the presence of hypercalcemia. The total serum calcium concentration should be used for both the initial and the repeat serum calcium measurements. If a laboratory known to measure ionized calcium reliably is available, some authorities prefer to measure the ionized calcium, although this usually adds little to the diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in patients with normal serum albumin concentrations and no abnormalities in acid-base balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In order to make this diagnosis, ionized calcium levels should be normal. In one series, 12 of 60 patients in whom the diagnosis of normocalcemic PHPT was considered had a raised serum concentration of ionized calcium in the presence of a normal total serum calcium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Previous values for serum calcium should be reviewed, if available. The presence of longstanding asymptomatic hypercalcemia is more suggestive of PHPT and, in young individuals, also raises the possibility of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum PTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) (second-generation PTH assay) or PTH 1-84 assays (third-generation) should be measured concomitantly with the serum calcium level to diagnose hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although limited data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] suggest that PTH is increased in a higher proportion of patients with PHPT using the PTH 1-84 assay, several other studies have found no increase in diagnostic utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Atypical presentations include a spectrum of disturbances in calcium homeostasis, ranging from symptomatic severe hypercalcemia (parathyroid crisis) to normocalcemic PHPT.

It is usually not difficult to differentiate between them. Malignancy is often evident clinically by the time it causes hypercalcemia, and patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy have higher calcium concentrations and are more symptomatic from hypercalcemia than individuals with PHPT.

As an example, some patients with occult malignancy may present with mild hypercalcemia. Alternatively, patients with hyperparathyroidism can occasionally have acute onset of severe, symptomatic hypercalcemia (parathyroid crisis). In these cases, measurement of intact PTH will usually distinguish the two diseases. Intact PTH concentrations are generally undetectable or very low in hypercalcemia of malignancy and are elevated or high-normal in PHPT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71910 \">table 3</a>).

A family history of hypercalcemia, especially in young children, and the absence of symptoms and signs of hypercalcemia (such as anorexia, neuromuscular symptoms, and polyuria) are characteristic of this disorder.</p><p>Fifteen to 20 percent of patients with FHH may have a mildly elevated PTH concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/20,21,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,26,27</a>]. In these individuals, it may be difficult to distinguish asymptomatic PHPT from FHH. It is important to make this distinction, however, because FHH is a benign inherited condition that typically does not require parathyroidectomy, nor will it be cured by it.</p><p>The major feature that distinguishes FHH from PHPT is a low urine calcium excretion and <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/creatinine</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Ca/Cr)</span> clearance ratio (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71910 \">table 3</a>). In contrast, in the absence of hypovitaminosis D, most patients with PHPT have either normal or elevated urinary calcium excretion. Because the calcium-sensing receptor is a cation receptor, urinary magnesium excretion parallels calcium excretion and is therefore low in FHH, in contrast with PHPT. (See <a href=\"#H3564970\" class=\"local\">'24-hour urinary calcium'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia&quot;, section on 'Distinction from primary hyperparathyroidism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two drugs deserve special consideration when evaluating a patient for hyperparathyroidism: thiazide diuretics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>.</p><p>Thiazide diuretics, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a>, reduce urinary calcium excretion and therefore can cause mild hypercalcemia (up to 11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>). In addition, some patients with hyperparathyroidism may be prescribed thiazides, which may elevate the serum calcium further and thereby unmask the hyperparathyroidism. Following discontinuation of the drug, these individuals remain hypercalcemic, although perhaps less so, and are found to have surgically proven hyperparathyroidism. Thus, if a patient taking a thiazide is found to be hypercalcemic, the drug should be withdrawn, if possible, and calcium and PTH assessed three months later. Persistent hypercalcemia (with elevated or high-normal PTH) after drug withdrawal suggests that the thiazide has unmasked PHPT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of primary hyperparathyroidism&quot;, section on 'Thiazide therapy'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> decreases parathyroid gland sensitivity to calcium, shifting the calcium-PTH curve to the right (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66597 \">figure 2</a>). Lithium may also reduce urinary calcium excretion. Lithium is thought to affect calcium-PTH dynamics through an action downstream of the calcium-sensing receptor, but the exact locus is still unknown. Some patients taking lithium develop hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria, and a subset of these individuals has high serum PTH concentrations. If the lithium can be stopped without exacerbating the psychiatric condition, the hypercalcemia may resolve. Following discontinuation, the serum calcium concentration is more likely to normalize if the duration of lithium use had been relatively short (eg, less than a few years), but less likely if it had been longer (eg, more than 10 years).

In these cases, it may be difficult to distinguish secondary hyperparathyroidism from early PHPT because the biochemical findings may be similar.</p><p>Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid gland appropriately responds to a reduced level of extracellular calcium. PTH concentrations rise, and calcium is mobilized by increasing intestinal absorption (via increase in calcitriol) and by increasing bone resorption. Thus, it is characterized biochemically by elevated PTH and normal or low serum calcium concentrations.

Assessment of renal function (serum creatinine), vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]), and calcium sufficiency (urinary calcium excretion) may help differentiate normocalcemic primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Further assessment and work-up for specific gastrointestinal disorders is generally undertaken only when the clinical suspicion is high.</p><p>Some patients may have more than one condition leading to increased PTH secretion. Co-existing PHPT and vitamin D deficiency is not uncommon.

The diagnosis is usually first suspected because of the incidental finding of an elevated serum calcium concentration on biochemical screening tests. In addition, PHPT may be suspected in a patient with nephrolithiasis. PHPT is diagnosed by finding a frankly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration in a patient with hypercalcemia. When the PTH is only minimally elevated, or within the normal range (but inappropriately normal given the patient's hypercalcemia), PHPT remains the most likely diagnosis, although familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), a rare disorder, is possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F104081\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104081 \">algorithm 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Serum PTH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism is a variant of PHPT. Patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism typically come to medical attention in the setting of an evaluation for low bone mineral density (BMD), during which time PTH levels are drawn and found to be elevated in the absence of hypercalcemia. In such cases, BMD at cortical sites may be preferentially affected. In order to make this diagnosis, all secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73157 \">table 2</a>) must be ruled out, and ionized calcium levels should be normal.

Measurement of 24-hour urine calcium excretion is helpful for distinguishing PHPT from FHH. Measurement of 25(OH)D is not only important to distinguish PHPT from other conditions, but also to identify patients with both PHPT and vitamin D deficiency, who require vitamin D repletion. (See <a href=\"#H3564970\" class=\"local\">'24-hour urinary calcium'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3565832\" class=\"local\">'Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the most common clinical presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic hypercalcemia with an elevated or high-normal intact PTH concentration, the presentation may be atypical. Atypical presentations include a spectrum of disturbances in calcium homeostasis, ranging from symptomatic severe hypercalcemia (parathyroid crisis) to normocalcemic PHPT. Laboratory testing often can distinguish atypical presentations of PHPT from other diseases, such as malignancy, FHH, and secondary hyperparathyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71910 \">table 3</a>).

In order to make management recommendations for patients with asymptomatic PHPT, we measure urinary calcium excretion and serum 25(OH)D (if both have not been previously measured), assess kidney function by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and obtain a BMD test. Some, but not all, UpToDate authors and editors also obtain imaging of the kidneys and spine to assess for occult kidney stones and vertebral compression fracture, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H3565081\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation to determine management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localization studies with ultrasonography, technetium-99m sestamibi, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning should <strong>not</strong> be used to establish the diagnosis of PHPT or to determine management. If localization studies are performed, they should be done after a decision for surgery has been made.
