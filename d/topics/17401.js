However, misuse of skin-lightening agents, particularly for the purpose of lightening one's natural skin color, can result in multiple short- and long-term complications. Examples include irritant contact dermatitis, exogenous ochronosis, mercury toxicity, cutaneous atrophy, and adrenal insufficiency. </p><p>The availability of skin-lightening formulations that are not regulated, that contain ingredients that are illegal to sell without a prescription, or that contain ingredients not intended for cutaneous use contributes to the development of complications. Adverse events may also result from prolonged or excessive use of approved skin-lightening formulations. </p><p>Early recognition of signs associated with skin-lightening agent misuse is important in reducing long-term sequelae. The complications associated with misuse of skin-lightening agents will be reviewed here. Appropriate use of skin-lightening agents for the treatment of cutaneous hyperpigmentation is reviewed separately.

The practice of skin bleaching (deliberate lightening of skin color with the use of various skin-lightening agents) is estimated to range from 25 to 67 percent of various populations in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. There have been no formal epidemiologic studies in Asia, North America, Europe, and Latin America, although case reports and small series from these countries have demonstrated misuse of skin-lightening agents in populations where the practice of skin bleaching is prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/1,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1977487244\"><span class=\"h1\">MOTIVATION FOR MISUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin-lightening industry is a multibillion-dollar industry that is projected to reach 23 billion dollars by the year 2020 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The widespread use of skin-lightening agents stems from cultural and commercial beauty ideals, many of which are propagated by media using local models with fair skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In numerous cultures in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and the Middle East, fair skin is frequently equated with higher social status and physical attractiveness due at least in part to complex historical sociopolitical factors. Extensions of these societal and beauty ideals are also seen among the diaspora of these populations residing in the Americas, Europe, and Australia.</p><p>Familial and psychologic factors also may contribute to misuse. A survey of 348 undergraduate females in Sudan found that the women were more likely to bleach their skin if a family member bleached skin or they were dissatisfied with skin color [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A questionnaire-based study of 1226 young adults from Jamaica, Barbados, and Grenada found associations between use of skin lightening-agents and a history of abuse as a child, symptoms of trauma, and significant depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1314835831\"><span class=\"h1\">AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin-lightening agents commonly found in regulated and unregulated skin-lightening products that can cause complications include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a>, corticosteroids, mercury salts, and caustic agents. The mechanism of action of hydroquinone involves inhibition of tyrosinase activity, which inhibits the conversion of dihydroxyphenylalanine to melanin. Topical corticosteroids and mercury salts have inhibitory effects on melanogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Caustic agents such as hydrogen peroxide may inhibit melanin production through toxic effects on melanocytes.</p><p>In the United States, products that contain skin-lightening agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> and topical corticosteroids are legally available as both prescription and nonprescription products. When used appropriately, risk for complications from such agents is low. However, unregulated skin-lightening products that contain unapproved ingredients or unapproved concentrations of ingredients can be obtained without a prescription in the United States and other countries. These products are typically purchased from small convenience stores, cosmetic shops, and street vendors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the United States, such products are usually imported by international companies or smuggled into areas where the demand is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Skin-lightening formulations containing unregulated ingredients can also be purchased via the internet worldwide.</p><p>Clinicians should be aware that ingredient lists provided on or in packages of skin-lightening agents are not always accurate. A study examining the active ingredients in the 10 best-selling skin-lightening creams in Durban, South Africa, found that nearly half of the analyzed products contained mercury as an active ingredient, although this was not listed on the label or package insert [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, according to the US Food and Drug Administration, cosmetics and skin-bleaching preparations should contain no more than a trace amount of mercury, defined as less than 1 part per million (ppm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, concentrations well above this limit have been found in numerous skin-lightening creams sold in the United States and internationally. In one study of 549 skin-lightening products, 6 percent contained mercury above 1000 ppm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Moreover, a study assessing mercury concentrations in spot urine specimens from a representative sample of 1840 adult New Yorkers found that mercury-containing&nbsp;skin-lightening&nbsp;creams were a source of exposure in individuals with the highest levels of mercury in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In some instances (particularly among sub-Saharan African populations), ingredients from the domestic environment (toothpaste, washing liquid, washing soda, hair straighteners, sand, cement, and even battery fluid) are mixed in homemade skin-bleaching concoctions for their caustic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/1,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4033049521\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Misuse of skin-lightening agents can result in a variety of local and systemic adverse effects.

Potential complications include short-term cutaneous side effects, exogenous ochronosis, abnormal skin repigmentation, darker pigmentation of skin overlying finger and toe joints, and trimethylaminuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3207892911\"><span class=\"h3\">Short-term cutaneous side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritant contact dermatitis, typically from concentrations higher than 4 percent or when mixed with caustic additives to increase absorption, is the most common short-term adverse event associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> and may result in postinflammatory dyspigmentation. Hydroquinone may also induce allergic contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3905541245\"><span class=\"h3\">Exogenous ochronosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive or long-term use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> can lead to exogenous ochronosis, which most often manifests as asymptomatic blue-black macules and patches, most commonly on the cheeks, temples, and neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90021%7EDERM%2F111604%7EDERM%2F111605\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90021 graphicRef111604 graphicRef111605 \">picture 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Three clinical stages of exogenous ochronosis have been described: erythema and mild pigmentation; hyperpigmentation, black colloid milia, and scanty atrophy; and papulonodules with or without surrounding inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-skin-lightening-agents-complications-associated-with-misuse/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Unlike its endogenous form (alkaptonuria), exogenous ochronosis lacks any systemic complications or urinary abnormalities.

A skin biopsy (eg, 3 or 4 mm punch biopsy) demonstrating yellow-brown, banana-shaped fibers in the papillary dermis is the gold standard for diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100568\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100568 \">picture 2</a>).
