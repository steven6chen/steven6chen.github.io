Studies vary in multiple ways, including the severity of maternal psychopathology, maternal drug dose, onset and duration of infant exposure, whether infants were exposed to multiple concurrent medications, whether infants exclusively breastfed, and assessment of adverse effects and exposure. Adverse effects (eg, irritability, poor feeding, or sleep disorders) observed in babies who are exposed to antidepressants through breast milk are often nonspecific and may due to other causes such as viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Studies that assay infant serum concentrations provide a more direct assessment of infant exposure than studies of maternal serum and breast milk concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, it is not established that a drug is safe if infant serum levels are undetectable, nor is it clear that measureable drug levels in infants are problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Although one study defined elevated infant serum concentrations as those that exceeded 10 percent of maternal serum concentrations, this definition was arbitrary, and the study authors acknowledged that their findings did not show that these elevated levels were clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nevertheless, some authorities think that a ratio of infant to maternal serum drug concentration &gt;10 percent may be clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6059499\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with postpartum mental disorders who require pharmacotherapy should generally not be discouraged from breastfeeding because the benefits of breastfeeding typically appear to outweigh the small risk posed by psychotropic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>]. However, formula feeding is a reasonable alternative for women who choose not to breastfeed or who suffer from increased mood or anxiety symptoms due to difficulties with breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Effective treatment for postpartum depression is critical. Untreated postpartum depression poses risks to mothers and children that include impaired maternal-infant interactions and suboptimal parenting practices, such as reduced use of car seats, reduced talking and reading to children, and use of more harsh punishment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], In addition, postpartum maternal depression is associated with adverse neurobehavioral development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], including delayed child cognitive development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although it is difficult to distinguish the adverse effects of infant exposure to psychotropic drugs from the effects of infant exposure to maternal psychopathology, the general consensus is that initiation or continuation of an effective psychotropic medication confers important benefits, such as preservation of mother-infant bonding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Further information about the adverse outcomes of postpartum depression is discussed separately.

All psychotropic medications are transferred to breast milk in varying amounts and are thus passed on to the nursing infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Milk is a fatty substance, and psychotropic medications are lipophilic. However, the amount of medication secreted into breast milk is highly variable across different patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Additional caution about exposure to medications through breastfeeding is warranted for low-birthweight or sick infants, as well as premature infants, whose ability to metabolize medications is less than that of full-term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, one preterm infant showed signs of serotonergic overstimulation (eg, tremor, myoclonus, and loose stools) during breast milk exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, preterm labor is associated with developing postpartum symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and the risks of untreated depression must be weighed against the risks of medication exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1336971\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General principles to bear in mind when choosing a psychotropic drug for postpartum, lactating patients with acute psychiatric illnesses include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are successfully treated with drugs during pregnancy should generally not change medications for the purpose of breastfeeding because fetal exposure to medications is substantially greater than it is for the breastfeeding infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/4,6-8,11,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-8,11,19-21</a>]. One review estimated that antidepressant exposure is 5 to 10 times lower in breastfed infants compared with in utero exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, using the same drug regimen during lactation as was used during pregnancy may prevent withdrawal in the neonate; one study of infants exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> in the third trimester found that poor neonatal adaptation occurred in fewer children who were breastfed than formula fed (19 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[8/43]</span> versus 55 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[6/11])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, it is not known if cumulative effects occur through fetal and infant exposure to medications during pregnancy plus breastfeeding. Neonatal withdrawal from antidepressants is discussed separately.

As an example, mothers can pump milk during the day so that family members can bottle-feed the baby, to allow for at least four to five hours of uninterrupted sleep. If the mother is not able to pump an adequate supply for the nighttime feeding, a bottle of formula may be given during the block of time that the mother&rsquo;s sleep is protected. Breastfeeding typically disrupts sleep, which can exacerbate mental disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2754652\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatricians should assess infant behavior, feeding, alertness, and sleep as well as physically examine infants to establish a baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding/abstract/3,8,12,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,12,24</a>].

Untreated maternal depression is associated with risks to the child, and low-quality studies suggest that the benefits of breastfeeding typically outweigh the small risk posed by psychotropic medications that are used to treat postpartum mental disorders in lactating mothers. (See <a href=\"#H2611892\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6058888\" class=\"local\">'Composite data'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All psychotropic medications are transferred to breast milk in varying amounts and thus are passed onto the nursing infant. The drug should be started at the lowest effective dose and titrated slowly. Additional caution about exposure through breastfeeding is warranted for premature, low-birthweight, or sick infants. (See <a href=\"#H2611892\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are successfully treated with psychotropic drugs during pregnancy should generally not change medications for the purpose of breastfeeding. In addition, lactating patients who initiate pharmacotherapy should be treated with medications that were efficacious in the past. Exposure can generally be decreased by choosing medications with shorter half-lives and greater protein binding. Polypharmacy should be avoided if possible. (See <a href=\"#H1336971\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a drug'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants exposed to medications via breast milk should be assessed by pediatricians at baseline and subsequently monitored periodically for adverse events. If adverse events in infants are suspected, mothers should immediately suspend breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"#H2754652\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>) appear to be compatible with breastfeeding because adverse events in exposed infants are typically minimal. Postpartum, lactating patients who start treatment with an antidepressant are often prescribed paroxetine or sertraline because of their safety record. In addition, the amount of paroxetine and sertraline that is secreted into breast milk is generally low or undetectable, and may be less compared with other SSRIs. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desvenlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desvenlafaxine</a> appear to be safe to use in breastfeeding women, based upon observational studies of exposed infants and the lack of adverse events. However, infant exposure may be greater with venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine than it is for some other antidepressants. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most atypical antidepressants have been studied in fewer nursing infants than SSRIs and SNRIs; however, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> may be compatible with breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Atypical'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few data regarding the safety of serotonin modulators in breastfeeding patients. (See <a href=\"#H95250889\" class=\"local\">'Serotonin modulators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several tricyclic antidepressants are compatible with breastfeeding. For women who start a tricyclic during lactation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> is usually favored due to its safety record; by contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a> is generally avoided. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Tricyclics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benzodiazepines that have short half-lives and no active metabolites (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>) are generally preferred in the context of breastfeeding. Potential adverse effects of benzodiazepines include withdrawal and sedation in infants. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diazepam</a> appears to be incompatible with breastfeeding.
