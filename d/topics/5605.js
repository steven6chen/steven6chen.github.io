There are several possible donor options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An identical twin (syngeneic, HLA identical)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sibling, relative, or unrelated donor (allogeneic, which can be HLA identical, haploidentical, or mismatched)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical cord blood (allogeneic, which can be HLA identical, haploidentical, or mismatched)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient (autologous, HLA identical)</p><p/><p>This topic will provide an overview of the general issues involved in donor selection for allogeneic HCT. The decision of which donor source to utilize depends, to a large degree, upon the clinical situation and the approaches employed at the individual transplant center. </p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91590540\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Matching donor and recipient for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (-A, -B, and -C) and class II (-DRB1 and -DQB1) haplotypes is a key part of successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Techniques for HLA typing and the HLA nomenclature have evolved with the increasing use of unrelated donors, the discovery of additional HLA alleles, and improved methods of HLA typing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serologic typing</strong> &ndash; Serologic typing, used for <strong>antigen</strong> matching, detects HLA proteins using serologic antibody-based assays. Serologic typing may be used for typing within families and depends upon the identification of parental HLA assignments such that all four HLA types are unequivocally defined in the family and distinguishable from one another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. When the donor and recipient are not related, serologic typing alone does not ensure that those individuals share the same HLA genes. Serological typing has largely been replaced by the more specific molecular typing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molecular typing</strong> &ndash; Molecular typing, used for <strong>allele</strong> matching, defines HLA genes by their DNA sequences. Molecular typing is necessary for HLA-matching in unrelated donor transplants and preferred by most centers for HLA-matching in related donor transplants. Molecular typing can differ by resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. High resolution typing defines sets of alleles that encode the same protein sequence for the HLA molecule's antigen binding site (eg, HLA-A*02:101). In contrast, low resolution typing provides information regarding the allele group but not the specific HLA protein (eg, HLA-A*02). High throughput sequencing is being explored as a more comprehensive analysis that provides complete typing information. &#160;</p><p/><p>The following definitions also apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 12 of 12 HLA match refers to donor-recipient pairs matched for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DP1 at the allele level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 10 of 10 HLA match refers to donor-recipient pairs matched for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1 at the allele level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 9 of 10 HLA match refers to pairs with a single allele or antigen mismatch at either HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, or HLA-DQB1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An 8 of 8 HLA match refers to donor-recipient pairs matched for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1 at the allele level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 7 of 8 HLA match refers to pairs with a single allele or antigen mismatch at either HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, or HLA-DRB1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 6 of 6 HLA match refers to donor-recipient pairs matched for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 at the allele level.</p><p/><p>Antigen mismatches can be further characterized as being in the &quot;graft-versus-host&quot; direction or the &quot;host-versus-graft&quot; direction: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A graft-versus-host direction mismatch means that the patient possesses one or more alleles not present in the donor. In such a mismatch, the donor T cells from the graft would be expected to mount an alloreactive response towards the patient (host) tissue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A host-versus-graft direction mismatch means that the donor possesses one or more alleles not present in the patient. In such a mismatch, the patient's T cells (host T cells) would be expected to mount an alloreactive response towards the donor (graft) cells.</p><p/><p>A HLA-DP mismatch refers to either a single or a double HLA-DPB1 allele mismatch in the graft-versus-host or host-versus graft direction, or both. HLA-DP mismatches can be further divided into permissive or non-permissive mismatches depending upon the haplotypes involved and the direction of the mismatch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6783558\" class=\"local\">'HLA-DP haplotype'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91588355\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) depend upon the underlying disease (reason for transplant), the timing of transplant (early versus late), patient comorbidities (including CMV seropositivity), and the choice of donor. The search for an appropriate donor must consider the urgency of the procedure and potential risks of postponing transplant. All patients likely to require an allogeneic HCT should undergo high-resolution HLA typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR soon after diagnosis to allow for the timely identification of an appropriate donor. Performing these tests early in the course of treatment is often critical so that the donor search can be initiated and time is not lost later.</p><p>The key factors in predicting survival after transplant are the stage of disease and the degree of HLA matching. There is a progressive decrease in post-HCT survival with each HLA allele mismatch reducing the probability of overall survival at five years by approximately 10 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91219 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. However, the absolute decrease in survival with each HLA allele mismatch lessens as the urgency of transplant increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As such, a decision regarding the best search plan must take into account the risk of relapse while performing a more extensive search. If the risk of relapse is high and the chance of finding a perfect match is low, then proceeding with a known mismatch or an alternative donor (haploidentical or umbilical cord blood transplant) may be preferable to a lengthy search for a full match. </p><p>When available, a matched sibling donor is preferred over other donor sources due to improved clinical outcomes following transplant (eg, less graft-versus-host disease) and the speed and cost-effectiveness of the search. As such, the initial search should center on molecular HLA typing of the patient's full biological siblings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91186\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91186 \">algorithm 1</a>). If a 6 of 6 matched sibling donor is identified and eligible for donation, transplantation should proceed. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Matched sibling donors'</a> below.)</p><p>When a 6 of 6 matched sibling donor is not available, the transplant center usually proceeds with an unrelated donor search. If an urgent transplant is required, some clinicians will choose to search for an umbilical cord blood (UCB) graft or a haploidentical donor since these grafts are usually quicker to acquire. An 8 of 8 matched unrelated donor results in similar survival rates to those seen with a matched sibling donor. However, it is not uncommon for it to take three or more months to identify an unrelated adult donor and procure the graft. Delays in time to transplant are associated with worse patient outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Alternative donor sources (UCB, haploidentical donors) may allow for a shorter time to transplant (eg, &lt;1 month), but with a potentially increased risk of transplant-related complications. Therefore, it is important to consider patient and donor typing as early as possible in the patient's treatment course. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Unrelated donors'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, searches for adult donors take into account HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 at high resolution. When an 8 of 8 matched unrelated adult donor is not available, options include a 7 of 8 matched unrelated adult donor, an at least 4 of 6 matched UCB unit with adequate cell dose, and a haploidentical donor (eg, parent, child, sibling). A choice among these must take into consideration the likelihood of confirming the match, obtaining the specimen, time to transplant, and individual center preferences and outcomes. The latter two may be faster, but also may be associated with increased complications. Increasing HLA disparity is associated with worse outcomes post HCT; however, recipients of UCB transplants are able to tolerate greater HLA disparity than those of other graft sources. As such, minimum matching criteria for unrelated adult donor transplant require an at least 7 of 8 HLA match, while umbilical cord blood transplant allows for a 4 of 6 matched UCB unit. Haploidentical donors are matched at 3 of 6 loci. UCB has a higher risk of graft failure and does not allow for additional grafts from the same donor, if needed. Haploidentical grafts allow for additional grafts if needed, but have a high rate of graft-versus-host disease or relapse depending upon the approaches utilized. These two graft sources are being compared in a randomized trials performed by The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN). These and other advantages and disadvantages of cord blood in relation to an unrelated adult donor are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H61604479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Advantages and limitations of cord blood'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>A choice among several equally matched donors is further narrowed based upon the type of graft planned (bone marrow versus peripheral blood), the mismatched HLA gene, further typing of other HLA genes, and an evaluation of the recipient for donor-specific HLA antibodies. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of graft planned and mismatched HLA gene &ndash; For patients undergoing bone marrow transplant, allele or antigen mismatch at HLA-B or HLA-C may be better tolerated than HLA-A or HLA-DR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast, for patients undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant, HLA-C antigen mismatch appears to convey a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other HLA genes &ndash; Typing for HLA-DP, -DQB1, and -DRB <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4/5</span> may improve outcomes. If the grafts are otherwise considered equal, donors with the greatest number of matches for these genes are preferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor-specific HLA antibodies &ndash; The presence of donor-specific HLA antibodies is associated with an increased risk of graft failure and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>A choice among several equally matched donors can then take into account other donor characteristics such as age, CMV status (matching for CMV status preferred), gender (males and nulliparous females preferred), and blood type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with guidelines published by the <a href=\"https://www.bethematchclinical.org/&amp;token=h7Ird6MEQJ0ciS3wlIS743j/fp9vPK20QHiVTBzYn3+1o+Ppnpk3yqCogMwegv5o&amp;TOPIC_ID=3535\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Marrow Donor Program</a> (NMDP, &quot;Be The Match&quot;) for adult donor and cord blood matching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite the availability of guidelines, donor selection is a complicated process that requires specific expertise. Help search strategy teams are available through the NMDP to provide commentary and donor recommendations for NMDP searches. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91590042\"><span class=\"h1\">MATCHED RELATED DONORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When available, a matched related donor is preferred over other donor sources for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91186\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91186 \">algorithm 1</a>). Advantages over other sources include a quicker and less expensive evaluation, and improved clinical outcomes post-transplant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Matched sibling donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While survival rates following fully matched unrelated donor transplantations are similar to those of matched sibling donor transplantations, sibling donor transplants are associated with less morbidity, including a lower rate of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As such, the patient's full biological siblings should undergo typing of HLA-A, -B, and -DR to identify potential sibling donors; specific typing for HLA-C is often not necessary because HLA-C and HLA-B are usually inherited together due to their tight linkage on chromosome 6. </p><p>Related donors are generally siblings, because they have the opportunity to inherit the same HLA genes (due to their proximity on chromosome 6). There is a 25 percent chance that a given sibling will be HLA-matched at the A, B, and DR loci, which are the principal loci evaluated in this setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72917 \">figure 2</a>). Unless the parents happen to have very common haplotypes or are consanguineous, it is unlikely that matched related donors will be anything other than siblings (eg, fully HLA-matched first cousins).</p><p>In matched siblings, serologic typing is adequate, since a match at these loci makes it highly likely that the same genes were inherited from the parents. However, many centers perform low resolution molecular typing to match siblings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Sibling donors and recipients are usually of similar age. Since increased donor age has been associated with decreased overall and disease free survival, it is not known whether it is better to choose an older-aged sibling or a young, matched unrelated donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H91588723\" class=\"local\">'Effect of donor characteristics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91591444\"><span class=\"h2\">Identical twin donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, patients who are candidates for HCT have an identical twin as a potential donor. These patients do not require post-transplant immunosuppression and do not develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, they are at a higher risk of relapse of any underlying malignant disease than similar patients transplanted with HLA-matched but nonidentical sibling donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This is especially true for patients transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), less so for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and has not been demonstrated in patients transplanted for non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The reason for this disparity is related to the ability of the donor lymphocytes to recognize the recipient tumor cells, known as a graft-versus-tumor (GVT) reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These relationships were illustrated in a review from 163 transplant centers that compared the results of 103 identical twin (syngeneic) and 1030 HLA-identical sibling (allogeneic) transplants for leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The three-year probability of relapse of leukemia was substantially higher in the syngeneic than allogeneic transplants in AML (52 versus 16 percent) and CML (40 versus 7 percent); the GVT effect was less apparent and not statistically significant in ALL (36 versus 26 percent). Interestingly, survival was similar with the two types of transplants because the increased incidence of leukemia relapse with identical twin transplants was counterbalanced by less treatment-related mortality, in particular GVHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-the-graft-versus-tumor-effect-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of the graft-versus-tumor effect following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Molecular scrutiny of the blood of the healthy twin (and potential transplant donor) is particularly relevant if the malignant clone in the unhealthy twin may have been present in utero, as has been shown for acute leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Under such circumstances, identical twins with a shared placental circulation may be harboring the identical malignant clone, with one twin developing clinically evident leukemia in advance of the other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">UNRELATED DONORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an HLA matched sibling donor is not available, the transplant center usually proceeds with an unrelated donor search (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91186\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91186 \">algorithm 1</a>). The adoption of high resolution, HLA allele-level typing for screening unrelated donors has been associated with improved outcomes in transplants using matched unrelated donors. Overall survival, relapse-free survival, and treatment-related mortality following transplant from carefully matched unrelated donors now approach those following matched related donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13,14,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,21-24</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2320382\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A higher degree of HLA matching is associated with superior survival rates. However, an unrelated donor search can take several months to identify an unrelated adult donor and procure the graft. Delays in time to transplant are associated with worse patient outcome, which can be due to progression of the underlying disease (eg, relapse, progression) or a change in comorbidities that impact transplant eligibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As such, if an urgent transplant is required, some clinicians will choose to search for an umbilical cord blood graft or a haploidentical donor since these grafts are usually quicker to acquire. </p><p>In 1986, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) was established as a repository for HLA-typing information so that unrelated donors and recipients could be matched [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Many international registries have also formed that allow for the worldwide search for appropriate donors for those in need of a bone marrow transplant procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The depth of resolution and number of alleles typed varied among and within the various registries.</p><p>At present, there are over 18 million donors registered worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These potential donors have undergone HLA-A and -B serologic typing. A significant percentage has also undergone molecular typing. The number of potential donors is increasing with greater public awareness of the need. Such a large number of donors is necessary because there is great diversity in the HLA system with over 5500 class I alleles (HLA-A, -B, and -C) and over 1600 class II alleles (HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1) resulting in several million potential HLA combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Many potential matches may be subsequently mismatched when higher resolution typing is performed.</p><p>It is more difficult to find a donor for patients from certain ethnic and racial backgrounds. As an example, it is much more likely that a matched unrelated graft will be found for a Caucasian recipient than for minorities in need in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. This is part due to underrepresentation in the data bank; in addition, African-Americans and Asian-Americans are more polymorphic than Caucasians with respect to HLA and have a relatively large number of haplotypes that are specific to their racial groups, making it more difficult to find donors at any registry size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Donor registries are actively seeking to expand their donor pool to increase diversity. In addition, HLA-based predictive algorithms (eg, HapLogic) can be used to predict the likelihood of finding a donor for an individual, thereby aiding in the search strategy. If predictive algorithms suggest that it is highly unlikely that a match will be found, it may be better to proceed with finding a mismatched or alternative donor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5890186\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiating the search</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To initiate a preliminary search of the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), contact the NMDP Office of Patient Advocacy at the following toll-free telephone number: 1-888-999-6743. Alternatively, a preliminary search request form can be submitted through the <a href=\"https://www.bethematchclinical.org/&amp;token=h7Ird6MEQJ0ciS3wlIS743j/fp9vPK20QHiVTBzYn3+1o+Ppnpk3yqCogMwegv5o&amp;TOPIC_ID=3535\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NMDP website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>Time is an issue, as it may take several months to complete a search for a matched unrelated donor, however, a preliminary search can be performed quickly and will give a rough idea of how likely it is that a donor can be found. This is largely due to the lack of complete typing data for the entire donor population, and the large expense required to perform all of the typing tests on all possible donors. In one study of 240 patients of Dutch origin, for example, an appropriate donor could be identified in approximately 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The search required six months. Approximately one-third of patients were transplanted, one-third had a potential donor but did not receive the transplant, and one-third did not have a suitable donor.</p><p>The long search times make this approach feasible only for those diseases with suitable clinical courses. This includes myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, CML, and when searches are initiated early in the course of treatment of patients with high-risk leukemias. Therefore, early discussion and initiation of an unrelated donor search <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral to the transplant center are essential for those patients in whom transplantation is a likely treatment option.</p><p>One aid in searching for an appropriate donor is the HapLogic program developed by the NMDP. This is a matching algorithm in which the probability of matching at HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 is calculated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The sorting order is for HLA-A, B and DRB1. These probabilities allow the physician to decide whether further testing of possible donors is warranted. If the probability of matching is high, then further testing of donors would be useful, but if the probability is zero or low, alternative donors should be pursued.</p><p>Once an appropriate donor is identified, the donor must be screened for general health and suitability. The bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells are harvested locally and then transported to the transplant center. It is feasible to collect donor hematopoietic cells virtually anywhere in the world.

Among patients undergoing unrelated donor bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell HCT, there is a progressive decrease in post-HCT survival with each HLA allele mismatch. Each HLA mismatch may reduce the probability of overall survival at five years by approximately 10 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91219 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In addition, HLA mismatching is associated with higher rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients transplanted for malignant disorders and higher rates of graft failure in patients transplanted for nonmalignant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].</p><p>As an example, a retrospective study from the CIBMTR evaluated the outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who underwent a matched related donor (624 patients), 8 of 8 HLA locus matched unrelated donor (1193 patients), or 7 of 8 HLA locus matched unrelated donor (406 patients) HCT between 2002 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Recipients of a matched related graft had a lower 100-day cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (33 versus 51 and 53 percent). When compared with recipients of a matched related donor graft, recipients of an 8 of 8 matched unrelated donor graft had similar survival rates at one (42 versus 55 percent) and three (37 versus 39 percent) years post-HCT. When compared with the other two groups, recipients of a 7 of 8 matched unrelated donor graft had a lower rate of overall survival at one year (45 percent), but similar rate of survival at three years (34 percent). </p><p>Reducing the degree of mismatch with sophisticated genotyping has, as noted above, resulted in decreased mortality following unrelated bone marrow transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/37,38,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,42</a>]. However, requiring more specific testing will undoubtedly reduce the number of donors available for an individual patient and may increase the amount of time required to locate a match, since the vast majority of patients in the registries have been typed with serologic assays.</p><p>Molecular typing of 10 HLA alleles (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1) has been considered the standard at most centers. However, the clinical significance of HLA-DQB1 is unclear. In contrast, there has been increased interest in the impact of the HLA-DP haplotype (a class II HLA), which appears to depend upon the specific haplotypes and the direction of the mismatch. The degree of HLA disparity that is tolerable depends upon many factors, including the clinical situation of the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>A large retrospective study evaluating the impact of HLA matching on clinical outcomes in 3857 donor-recipient pairs undergoing myeloablative HCT in the United States between 1988 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The vast majority received T cell replete bone marrow grafts and calcineurin inhibitor-based GVHD prophylaxis. At a median follow-up of six years, the following outcomes were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When compared with fully matched (10 of 10) transplants, mismatch at a single locus (9 of 10) was associated with significantly worse overall survival (relative risk [RR] 1.17; 95% CI 1.06-1.33), disease-free survival (RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.05-1.28), treatment-related mortality (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.16-1.47), and acute GVHD (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.19-1.56). Single locus mismatch did not appear to impact relapse rate, engraftment, or chronic GVHD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subset analysis revealed that HLA-DQ did not impact outcome as a single mismatch or when paired with another mismatch. In contrast, mismatch at HLA-A, -B, -C, and &ndash;DR was associated with worse clinical outcomes. A single mismatch detected either by low- or high-resolution DNA testing at one of these four loci (ie, a 7 of 8 match) was associated with higher mortality (relative risk 1.25; 95% CI 1.13-1.38). Single mismatches at HLA-B or HLA-C appeared to be better tolerated than mismatches at HLA-A or HLA-DRB1, while mismatches at HLA-DP or HLA-DQ loci and donor factors other than HLA type were not associated with reduced survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each additional HLA mismatch reduced overall survival by approximately 10 percent, being 52, 43, and 33 percent for those with 8 of 8, 7 of 8, and 6 of 8 matches, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91219 \">figure 1</a>). The absolute decrease in survival was more pronounced among patients with early stage disease. In patients with high-risk disease, the increased risk due to mismatched appeared to be abrogated by the high risk of relapse from the underlying disease.</p><p/><p>These data support the use of high resolution matching of HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 when searching for an unrelated bone marrow donor. When an 8 of 8 matched donor is not available, a preference may be given for single mismatches at HLA-B and HLA-C over mismatches at HLA-A or -DRB1 or the use of alternative donors (haploidentical or umbilical cord blood). The impact of HLA matching appears to be similar for patients receiving an unrelated peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplant except that HLA-C antigen mismatches are generally avoided since they appear to convey a worse prognosis.</p><p>The impact of HLA matching in PBPC transplant was evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 1933 patients undergoing unrelated PBSC transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This study had a significant number of patients undergoing reduced intensity conditioning and most transplants were performed in patients with AML. As in bone marrow transplant, HLA-DQB1 mismatch did not appear to impact outcome. Antigen mismatching at HLA-C was the only antigen that demonstrated a significant increase in the risk for mortality, disease-free survival, treatment-related mortality, and graft-versus-host disease. However, the number of patients with other single mismatched alleles was low, thereby limiting the power to detect a difference.</p><p>The direction of antigen mismatch may impact patient outcome. In one study, patients with a bidirectional 7 of 8 HLA mismatch or a graft-versus-host 7 of 8 HLA mismatch had significantly increased transplant-related mortality and decreased overall and disease-free survival when compared with patients with an 8 of 8 HLA match [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In contrast, patients with a host-versus-graft 7 of 8 HLA mismatch had similar outcomes to those with an 8 of 8 HLA match.</p><p>The location of antigen mismatch within an HLA allele may also impact patient outcome. In one study, the specific peptide position involved in the HLA mismatch determined whether a class I mismatch was permissive or nonpermissive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Nonpermissive mismatches were associated with higher rates of GVHD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality and occurred at positions 116 or 99 of HLA-C and at position 9 of HLA-B. A 7 of 8 HLA mismatch that did not include amino acid substitutions at one of these positions had outcomes similar to those seen with 8 of 8 HLA matches. The importance of permissive and nonpermissive mismatches of the HLA-DP haplotype is described below.</p><p>Patient outcome may also be impacted by the expression level of the mismatched antigen. As an example, in a study of 1975 patients receiving an unrelated donor graft with a single mismatch at HLA-C, increased expression of the mismatched HLA-C allele was associated with increased risks of acute GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, and overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Retrospective analyses looking at the impact of HLA-DP haplotype on HCT outcomes suggested that mismatching at the HLA-DP loci was not associated with reduced survival, but was associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD and a reduced risk of disease relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,7,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,47</a>]. However, subsequent studies suggested that the impact of an HLA-DP mismatch varies depending upon the specific haplotypes, the direction of the mismatch, and the degree of haplotype expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. A choice among several donors equally matched for HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1 may be further narrowed by evaluation of the HLA-DPB1 haplotype. Selection of a matched or permissive HLA-DP haplotype appears to decrease early non-relapse mortality, but its impact long-term survival is unclear.</p><p>In an international retrospective analysis of 8539 unrelated donor and recipient pairs matched for 10 of 10 HLA alleles (64 percent) or 9 of 10 HLA alleles (36 percent), HLA-DPB1 status was identified as matched (20 percent), non-permissive mismatched (31 percent), or permissive mismatched (49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

In this latter study, this increase in transplant-related mortality appeared to result in a small increase in overall mortality among those with an 8 of 8 HLA match or 10 of 10 HLA match. </p><p>The degree of HLA-DPB1 haplotype expression varies on the surface of donor and recipient cells and the HLA-DPB1 regulatory region variant rs9277534 can act as a marker of HLA-DPB1 cell-surface expression in an individual. A retrospective analysis of 1441 unrelated donor and recipient pairs matched for 10 of 10 HLA alleles with one HLA-DPB1 mismatch used rs9277534 as a marker of HLA-DPB1 cell-surface expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. When compared with those with low expression (rs9277534A), recipients with high expression (rs9277534G) had a greater likelihood of severe acute GVHD. The graft versus host response was highest among recipients with high expression who received a graft from a low expressing donor. Such patients had a high rate of acute GVHD and an increased risk of death due to causes other than disease recurrence. &#160; &#160;</p><p>While these studies suggest that the best clinical outcomes are seen among pairs with a 12 of 12 HLA match (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1, DPB1), this level of match will be seen in only approximately 20 percent of patients previously identified as a 10 of 10 HLA match (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1). Further delineation of HLA-DPB1 mismatches as permissive and non-permissive or determination of HLA-DPB1 expression allows for more informed donor selection. When all other factors are equal, selection of a 12 of 12 matched donor should be preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3450417374\"><span class=\"h3\">MHC-I MICA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MHC-encoded class I chain-related gene A (<em>MICA</em>) is a human HLA-encoded transplantation antigen that also influences the risk of GVHD and disease relapse.

The 12 percent of pairs who were mismatched in <em>MICA</em> experienced increased grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR 1.83; 95% CI 1.50-2.23), chronic GVHD (HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.45-1.55) and non-relapse mortality (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.24-1.46). The increased risk for GVHD was mirrored by a lower risk for relapse (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.43-0.59). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2320839\"><span class=\"h3\">Donor-specific HLA antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of donor-specific HLA antibodies is associated with an increased risk of graft failure. When selecting among several otherwise equivalent donors, the recipient should undergo screening for donor-specific HLA antibodies if there is an HLA mismatch. Preference is given for donors with HLA haplotypes to which the recipient has no antibodies, and patients who harbor an HLA directed antibody that is expressed by the donor should proceed with great caution and generally should not be used. Occasionally, attempts at reducing the titer of the anti-HLA antibody can be performed prior to transplantation with variable results.</p><p>A retrospective, case-controlled study examined stored serum samples from 37 patients who did not attain sustained engraftment following mismatched unrelated HCT and compared them with serum samples of 78 case-matched controls who attained sustained engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Controls were matched for disease, disease status, graft type, age, sex and year of transplant. Approximately 35 percent of patients had anti-HLA antibodies. The presence of anti-HLA antibodies did not predict graft failure. However, identification of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (those directed against the donor's HLA haplotype) was associated with a high rate of graft failure. Of the 10 samples with donor specific anti-HLA antibodies, nine failed to engraft. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21756795\"><span class=\"h2\">KIR gene haplotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of matching for non-HLA sites is not as well studied. The killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) gene complex encodes up to 15 genes for natural killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors that recognize epitopes of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, which are also called KIR ligands. KIR haplotypes can be activating or inhibitory. More specifically, individuals vary in the number of KIR genes that they possess, and the complex has been broadly characterized as A and B haplotypes. KIR-haplotype A mainly encode inhibitory receptors and only one activating receptor, while KIR-haplotype B encode more activating receptors (eg, KIR2DS1, KIR3DS1). Initial reports suggest that the donor's KIR gene haplotype may influence transplant outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/55-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-60</a>].</p><p>A study of 1409 unrelated transplant donors providing grafts for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) reported that KIR ligand status affected the outcomes of patients with AML, but not those of patients with ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Patients with AML who received grafts from donors with B motifs had a lower rate of relapse and superior survival rates.

The rate of relapse was lower among patients whose donor had the KIR2DS1 haplotype (27 versus 33 percent). This benefit from the KIR2DS1 haplotype was primarily seen in transplants from donors who were homozygous or heterozygous for HLA-C1 antigens. In contrast, donor KIR3DS1 positivity did not impact AML relapse rates, but was associated with decreased mortality following transplant (60 versus 67 percent).</p><p>The KIR gene haplotype can easily be performed along with HLA genotyping.

(See <a href=\"#H2320424\" class=\"local\">'Initial matching'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an 8 of 8 matched unrelated adult donor is not available, options include a 7 of 8 matched unrelated adult donor, an at least 4 of 6 matched umbilical cord blood unit with adequate cell dose, and a haploidentical donor (eg, parent, child, sibling). A choice among these must take into consideration the likelihood of confirming the match, obtaining the specimen, and time to transplant. Umbilical cord blood and haploidentical donors may allow for a shorter time to transplant, but with a potentially increased risk of transplant-related complications. (See <a href=\"#H6783633\" class=\"local\">'HLA gene haplotypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A choice among several equally matched donors is further narrowed based upon the type of graft planned (bone marrow versus peripheral blood), the mismatched HLA gene, further typing of other HLA genes, and an evaluation of the recipient for donor-specific HLA antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H6783633\" class=\"local\">'HLA gene haplotypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice between available donors is also dependent upon the particular expertise and focus of the individual transplant center. The role of haploidentical related donors is under ongoing clinical investigation and is particularly attractive in settings where there is no matched related donor and not time to search for an unrelated donor.
