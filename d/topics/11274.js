Sequencing of the protein-coding exons from 20,661 genes in 24 advanced ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas provided the foundation for a more complete understanding of the key signaling pathways that are dysregulated in pancreatic tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing studies from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have built on this foundation, and the genetics of pancreatic cancer are now well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Progress in our understanding of the genes involved in the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer has provided insight into the familial aggregation of the disease and the progression of normal pancreatic cells to noninvasive precursor lesions and to invasive carcinoma, and has led to a new classification system of pancreatic neoplasms that encompasses both morphology and genetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>As a general rule, multiple combinations of genetic mutations are commonly found in pancreatic adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

This gene is the human homolog of a transforming gene isolated from the Kirsten rat sarcoma virus, hence the name <em>KRAS</em>. As noted earlier, <em>KRAS</em> is an oncogene. Mutations in this gene, the vast majority of which are at codon 12, are activating, leading to abnormal activation of the protein product of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Over 90 percent of pancreatic cancers harbor a <em>KRAS</em> gene mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/1,4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,13,14</a>]. Furthermore, these mutations appear to occur very early in pancreatic carcinogenesis, as indicated by their presence in noninvasive precursors. <em>KRAS</em> gene mutations have been identified in noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and in noninvasive mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), and the prevalence of mutations increases with increasing degrees of dysplasia in these noninvasive precursor lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Mouse studies provide compelling evidence that oncogenic <em>KRAS</em> is required for the formation of PanIN, the most common precursor lesion to pancreatic cancer, as well as for the initiation and maintenance of invasive pancreatic cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

Most of these inactivating mutations lead to loss of function of p16, the protein product of the <em>CDKN2A</em> gene.

In 30 percent of tumors, the gene is inactivated by homozygous deletion, and in another 20 percent of cases, there is an intragenic mutation coupled with loss of the second allele.</p><p>The protein product of the <em>SMAD4</em> gene functions in the transmission of intracellular signals from transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) receptors within the cell membrane to the nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Mutations in genes coding for other components of the TGFb signaling pathway, such as <em>SMAD3</em>, <em>TGFbR1</em>, and <em>TGFbR2</em>, have also been reported in pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/1-4,23,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,23,32</a>], underscoring the importance of this signaling pathway to the development of pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>].</p><p>The inactivation of <em>SMAD4</em> in pancreatic cancer is important for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An immunostain for the SMAD4 protein has been developed, and the results of immunohistochemical labeling of tissue sections using this antibody strongly correlate with <em>SMAD4</em> gene status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This means that immunohistochemistry for the presence or absence of SMAD4 protein can be used diagnostically, as an adjunct to the interpretation of difficult tissue biopsies, and to suggest the pancreas as a possible primary in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-pathogenesis-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, if a patient had a pancreatic cancer in which <em>SMAD4</em> is genetically inactivated and later developed an adenocarcinoma in the lung that showed intact SMAD4 expression, it could be deduced that the tumor in the lung was a separate primary.

Of the 225 patients whose pancreatic cancers were sequenced in the IMPACT study, only three (1 percent) received a matched therapy based upon the sequencing results. Even worse, the disease progressed in two of the three patients who received targeted therapy based on the somatic mutations in their cancer, and the third patient was lost to follow-up. Notably, however, in contrast to the disappointing clinical impact of sequencing pancreatic cancers for somatic mutations, therapeutic responses were observed in patients who had targetable germline variants, such as deleterious variants in the <em>BRCA2 </em>gene.</p><p>Putting this all together, one approach to personalized medicine for patients with pancreatic cancer would be to test their cancers for microsatellite instability and to sequence their germline for deleterious variants in known familial pancreatic cancer genes, including <em>BRCA2</em>, <em>BRCA1</em>, and <em>PALB2</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is a genetic disease that is caused by inherited and acquired mutations in specific cancer-associated genes.
