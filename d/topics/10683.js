They are made soluble by attachment to circulating lipoproteins that transport lipids to various tissues for energy utilization, lipid deposition, steroid hormone production, and bile acid formation. The lipoprotein consists of esterified and unesterified cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, and protein.</p><p>There are five major lipoproteins in blood: chylomicrons; very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL); intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL); low-density lipoprotein (LDL); and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Each of these classes of lipoproteins carries cholesterol and triglyceride to a varying degree, with LDL carrying the majority of cholesterol and VLDL carrying the majority of triglyceride.</p><p>In general, patient care issues related to screening, diagnosis, and treatment are based on the results of the measurement of serum lipids, which is generally accomplished by obtaining a lipid profile. On occasion, measurement of serum lipoproteins is necessary for one or more of these purposes. This topic will discuss the issues relevant to the measurement of serum lipids and lipoproteins. Other issues related to lipids and lipoproteins, such as their role in atherosclerosis, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein classification, metabolism, and role in atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24361010\"><span class=\"h1\">LIPID PROFILE AND COMPONENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard serum lipid profile measures the concentration of total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as well as the triglycerides. With these values, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration can be estimated. (See <a href=\"#H24360864\" class=\"local\">'LDL cholesterol'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24361770\"><span class=\"h2\">Total and HDL cholesterol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum total and HDL-C are measured directly and can be obtained in fasting or nonfasting individuals; there are only small, clinically insignificant differences in these values between measurements in the fasting or non-fasting state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2151542276\" class=\"local\">'Fasting versus non-fasting tests'</a> below.)</p><p>The total cholesterol can vary by 4 to 11 percent within an individual due to multiple factors including stress, minor illness, and posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Values may also vary between different laboratories, with data suggesting that a single measurement of serum cholesterol can vary as much as 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Thus, in an individual with a &quot;true&quot; serum cholesterol concentration of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> the range of expected values is 172 to 228 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.5 to 5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These observations suggest that more than one measurement of total cholesterol should be obtained when treatment considerations demand a precise determination. Serum HDL cholesterol may demonstrate even greater variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Blood lipid levels also exhibit mild seasonal variation with a peak in total cholesterol level in the winter and a trough in the summer. One study found that the amplitude of seasonal variation of total cholesterol concentration was 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in men and 5.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3116442507\"><span class=\"h2\">Total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ratio of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol concentration has been used in many epidemiological studies to categorize populations into high- and low-risk subgroups. The clinical use of this ratio is discussed elsewhere.

Stated another way, and understanding that this is an approximation, the total cholesterol in plasma or serum is the sum of cholesterol found in each of the VLDL, HDL, and LDL lipoprotein particle types. The Friedewald formula is applied to lipid values measured in the fasted state. In a non-fasting patient, the contribution of post-prandial chylomicrons to the total lipoprotein pool makes the formula much less accurate. </p><p>As mentioned above, total and HDL cholesterol are measured directly (see <a href=\"#H24361770\" class=\"local\">'Total and HDL cholesterol'</a> above) VLDL cholesterol is approximated by dividing the measured total triglyceride level by 5. With the measured total and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride, an approximate LDL cholesterol can be calculated. Calculators for determining LDL cholesterol are available (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-friedewald-equation-for-low-density-lipoprotein-ldl-c\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-friedewald-equation-for-low-density-lipoprotein-ldl-c-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p>As with most laboratory measurements made on human <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/serum,</span> there is some sample to sample variability in the LDL cholesterol.

There is some evidence to suggest that the magnitude of the error is greater at lower LDL cholesterol levels, particularly around 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a study of nearly 16,000 patients with fasting triglyceride concentrations &lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.<span class=\"nowrap\">5&nbsp;mmol/L),</span> the 95% confidence interval for a calculated LDL cholesterol of 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> was 60 to 86 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.6 to 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> using LDL cholesterol measured by beta quantification (considered the gold standard) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].&nbsp;While the magnitude of variability at low LDL cholesterol values creates some clinical uncertainty, we interpret single values for LDL cholesterol in the context of prior values.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182091092\"><span class=\"h3\">Direct measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assays are available to directly measure the LDL cholesterol concentration and should be considered in patients with a total triglyceride concentration &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.516 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. However, even in patients with lower triglyceride values, some direct assays may give significantly different results than the estimated LDL cholesterol, and all of the treatment guidelines for hypercholesterolemia were based upon the estimated value.</p><p>The magnitude of the difference in LDL cholesterol values between results derived from the Friedewald equation and direct measurement was evaluated in a study of 1,310,440 United States adults who underwent lipid profiling by vertical spin density gradient ultracentrifugation (2009 to 2011) and who had triglycerides &lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.516 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The broad conclusion of the research was that the LDL cholesterol, as calculated by the Friedewald equation, became progressively inaccurate as triglyceride levels increased; this was particularly apparent at LDL cholesterol values &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.81 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. For example, of patients with Friedewald LDL cholesterol &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 23 percent had a direct LDL cholesterol &ge;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (39 percent if triglycerides concurrently 150 to 199 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> 59 percent if triglycerides concurrently 200 to 399 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102005055\"><span class=\"h3\">Other indirect methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other (than Friedewald) indirect methods for deriving the LDL cholesterol level have been proposed. One relatively simple method, which was derived and validated in a sample of over 1.3 million lipid profiles, uses an adjustable factor for the triglyceride to VLDL cholesterol ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a large cross-sectional analysis, this novel method of LDL estimation was more accurate than the Friedewald equation for both fasting and nonfasting samples across a range of LDL cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among nonfasting samples, the novel method especially outperformed the Friedewald equation when LDL cholesterol was low (&lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or when triglyceride levels were high. The validity and utility of this method need further testing before we can recommend its routine use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24363001\"><span class=\"h2\">Triglycerides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triglycerides are carried in chylomicron and VLDL particles. Triglyceride levels are influenced by recent food intake and should be measured in the fasting state when possible. (See <a href=\"#H2151542276\" class=\"local\">'Fasting versus non-fasting tests'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24362332\"><span class=\"h1\">LDL PARTICLE SIZE AND NUMBER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol does not accurately quantify LDL particles no matter how accurately the analytical techniques. This situation is most notable when the LDL particle size is small, since small LDL particles carry less cholesterol than large LDL particles. For the same amount of LDL cholesterol, the patient with smaller LDL particles may require nearly 70 percent more LDL particles to carry the same amount of cholesterol as the patient with larger LDL particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There are strong associations between total LDL particle concentration and cardiovascular disease, which provide a rationale for advanced lipoprotein testing for total LDL particle numbers in cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>As an example, among patients with insulin resistance disorders (metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes), there is discordance between LDL cholesterol and LDL particle <span class=\"nowrap\">concentration/apolipoprotein</span> B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This discordance results from LDL remodeling in insulin resistance, which results in a smaller, cholesterol-depleted LDL particle. Thus, LDL cholesterol levels do not change with insulin resistance or with the number of metabolic risk factors, whereas the concentration of small LDL particles and total LDL particles increases progressively as the severity of insulin resistance increases and the number of metabolic risk factors increases. On statin therapy, nearly two-thirds of type 2 diabetes patients with LDL cholesterol levels less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> have excess LDL particles. In patients with type 2 diabetes and LDL cholesterol levels less than 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> on statin therapy, 41 percent have excess numbers of LDL particles.</p><p>A 2009 systematic review (of 24 studies) evaluated the association between cardiovascular outcomes and LDL subfractions or distribution (particle size; density) as well as total LDL particle number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Higher LDL particle number was consistently associated with increased cardiovascular risk, independent of lipid markers. LDL <span class=\"nowrap\">subfractions/size</span> did not add incremental risk prediction beyond that achieved with traditional risk factors.</p><p>Lipoprotein particle sizes can be measured by special laboratories that use three different analytical techniques. These laboratory methods include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gradient gel electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, and ion mobility (IM). Lipoprotein particle size is most often reported as an average size that takes into account the contribution of the small, intermediate, and large particles. Unlike the other methods, NMR spectroscopy reports the total concentration or blood levels of the individual LDL subclasses and then derives the average LDL particle size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. LDL particle concentration can be measured by NMR and IM methods.</p><p>In high cardiometabolic risk patients, such as those with diabetes, where the disconnect between LDL cholesterol and LDL particle size is greatest, the measurement of LDL particle size may be of benefit for improving risk stratification and as a guide to <span class=\"nowrap\">titration/adjustment</span> of lipoprotein modifying therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24362266\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-HDL CHOLESTEROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is defined as the difference between the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Non-HDL cholesterol includes all cholesterol present in lipoprotein particles that is considered atherogenic, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), lipoprotein(a), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). It has been suggested that the non-HDL cholesterol fraction may be a better tool for risk assessment than LDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These measurements can be used to calculate non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol &ndash; HDL cholesterol).

For instance, each LDL particle contains one molecule of apolipoprotein B. Some have proposed that the measurement of lipoproteins or apolipoproteins may be useful in some patients. We agree with the 2010 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association guideline for assessment of cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic adults, which does not recommend the use of these tests for cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/8,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2151542276\"><span class=\"h1\">FASTING VERSUS NON-FASTING TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the exceptions of the first time a lipid profile is obtained or when the test is obtained for the purpose of following known hypertriglyceridemia, the lipid profile (or its components) does not require fasting in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. However, many experts routinely ask their patients to fast for a follow-up lipid profile so that there is no need to repeat the test due to a concern for an inaccurate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol due to high triglycerides. </p><p>The decision whether to have the patient fast for a subsequent lipid profile is in part dependent on patient convenience and the likelihood that the calculated LDL cholesterol value might be inaccurate due to elevated triglycerides. (See <a href=\"#H24361010\" class=\"local\">'Lipid profile and components'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients at increased risk for triglycerides high enough to make the calculated LDL cholesterol significantly different from a measured (direct) LDL cholesterol include those with type 2 diabetes, very obese individuals, those taking medications known to increase triglycerides, and patients with significant alcohol intake.

From a practical point of view, this means that the test will need to be obtained early in the morning (before breakfast). While mean population levels of triglycerides and calculated LDL cholesterol do not appear to vary substantially with different lengths of time since eating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], clinically important variability in triglyceride levels in <strong>individual</strong> patients after consumption of fatty foods and drinks is likely and consistent with clinical experience. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertriglyceridemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertriglyceridemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following serves to give a more detailed explanation of the potential impact of the results of a non-fasting test. If a patient has a lipid profile soon after eating a very fatty meal, chylomicrons are made to absorb the fat.&nbsp;The ratio of triglyceride to cholesterol in a chylomicron is about 20:1. In the fasting state, if there are no chylomicrons, then most of the triglyceride in the blood is being carried by very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and the triglyceride to cholesterol ratio in those particles is 5 to 1.&nbsp;That ratio is what most clinical laboratories use to calculate the cholesterol contribution of VLDL particles (see <a href=\"#H182091085\" class=\"local\">'Friedewald equation'</a> above). If a patient has a fasting triglyceride of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and their postprandial, fatty meal triglyceride was 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> then the VLDL cholesterol calculation would be performed and the VLDL cholesterol would be estimated at <span class=\"nowrap\">300/5</span> or 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. But if all the increased triglyceride (ie, the increase from 100 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)&nbsp;is</span> due to chylomicrons, the actual VLDL plus chylomicron cholesterol is the <span class=\"nowrap\">100/5</span> (from the VLDL that are present) plus <span class=\"nowrap\">200/20</span> which is the cholesterol in the chylomicrons.&nbsp;This amounts to a total of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> not 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. The difference between the 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> the laboratory would calculate and the 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> which is the correct number to be using is 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and that higher value would be wrongly subtracted to give an LDL cholesterol that is 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> lower than it actually is.&nbsp;If a patient comes in and their fasting triglyceride is 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and their non-fasting triglyceride is 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> then the error in using the calculated LDL cholesterol is so small as not to matter. So, the key thing is that if there is a good record of fasting triglycerides in a patient and then a non-fasting one return with a much higher value, a very significant error could be introduced into the LDL cholesterol calculation if they use that non-fasting value.</p><p>Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are minimally affected by fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. LDL cholesterol is typically calculated from total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides using the Friedewald equation (LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol &ndash; HDL cholesterol &ndash; triglycerides x 0.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This equation is modified for those with particularly elevated levels of triglycerides (&gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> but even with modification is only accurate for patients who are fasting. In patients who have consumed fats prior to testing, various lipid components (eg, chylomicrons) will be elevated, which will result in a calculated LDL cholesterol that is falsely low compared with what would have been calculated in the fasting state.</p><p>The largest observational study comparing fasting and non-fasting lipid values evaluated results in over 90,000 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
