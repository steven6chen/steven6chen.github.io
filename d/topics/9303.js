Intestinal atresia is one of the most frequent causes of bowel obstruction in the newborn and can occur at any point in the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately one-half of the cases involve the duodenum. &#160;</p><p>The outcome of intestinal atresia following surgical repair is very good. In general, morbidity and mortality depend upon associated medical conditions such as prematurity or cystic fibrosis, other congenital anomalies, the complexity of the lesion, and surgical complications.</p><p>Atresia and stenosis of the small and large intestine are reviewed here. Esophageal atresia and anorectal malformations, including rectal atresia, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-intrathoracic-airways-and-tracheoesophageal-fistula#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula&quot;, section on 'Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704000513\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other causes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of intestinal atresia ranges from 1.3 to 3.5 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>], of which about 20 percent are associated with a chromosomal anomaly. The incidence and associated anomalies vary by anatomical site:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duodenal atresia occurs in approximately 0.9 infants per 10,000 births, and represents up to 60 percent of small intestinal atresias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of infants with duodenal atresia have a chromosomal anomaly, primarily Down syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jejunal or ileal atresia occurs in approximately 0.7 per 10,000 births, each representing about 20 percent of small intestinal atresias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonic atresia is the least common type; the incidence is approximately 0.25 per 10,000 births, or 7 to 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interruption of the normal development of the gastrointestinal tract may result in intestinal atresia. The mechanism varies with the segment of bowel that is affected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Duodenal atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duodenum is derived partly from the embryonic foregut and partly from the midgut. During early gestation (weeks six and seven), portions of the intestinal tract become occluded as the endodermal epithelium proliferates. Patency is restored as recanalization occurs during weeks eight to ten. Duodenal atresia is thought to result from failure of the bowel to recanalize during this period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-development-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the development of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Jejunal and ileal atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jejunoileal atresia has been classified into four types based upon anatomic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Type III is the most common, and type I is the least common form (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64916\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64916 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Jejunal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ileal atresia typically is an acquired lesion thought to result from vascular disruption leading to ischemic necrosis of the fetal intestine. Because the fetal bowel is sterile, the necrotic tissue is resorbed, leaving blind proximal and distal ends, often with a gap in the mesentery. This type of atresia has been reproduced in experimental animals by ligation of mesenteric blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>]. Causes of the vascular disruption in the human fetus include segmental or midgut volvulus, intussusception, internal hernia, and interruption of the segmental mesenteric blood supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Some cases are caused by underlying intestinal pathology, which interrupts the blood supply to the gut during fetal life.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic fibrosis &ndash; A fetus with cystic fibrosis is predisposed to segmental volvulus due to inspissated meconium, and this may develop into a jejunal or ileal atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroschisis &ndash; Gastroschisis is frequently complicated by intestinal atresias, 11 percent of cases in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The extent ranges from a simple localized lesion to the rare occurrence of atresia of the entire herniated bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The atresia is thought to be caused by compression of the gut at the level of the opening in the abdominal wall, or by volvulus of the herniated bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As the necrotic bowel is resorbed, the proximal bowel seals off, forming an atresia that is usually in the proximal jejunum. The abdominal wall defect may also close as the herniated bowel disappears. The prognosis of this variant is poor because the loss of almost the entire small bowel results in severe short gut syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroschisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroschisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midgut volvulus &ndash; Type IIIB or apple peel atresia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64916\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64916 \">figure 1</a>) may result from a volvulus of all or part of the midgut during gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As a result, much of the gut supplied by the superior mesenteric artery disappears, leaving a high jejunal or occasionally even a distal duodenal atresia. The distal ileum winds around a thin vascular stalk, which usually consists of the left branch of the ileocolic artery. A large gap in the mesentery is present along with intestinal malrotation and a microcolon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Processes that contribute to thrombosis also may contribute in some cases, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications &ndash; Maternal use of vasoconstrictive medications may contribute to interruption of mesenteric blood flow. This was illustrated by a case-control study in which combined exposure to vasoconstrictive drugs (including methylenedioxymethamphetamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pseudoephedrine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ephedrine</a>) and cigarette smoking in the first trimester of pregnancy nearly tripled the risk of small intestinal atresia (odds ratio 2.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk was increased 4.2 times in women who used vasoconstrictive drugs and smoked &ge;20 cigarettes per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inherited thrombophilia leading to spontaneous thrombosis &mdash; In one study, the factor V Leiden mutation and a polymorphism of the factor VII gene, both of which are risk factors for thrombosis, occurred more often in newborns with intestinal atresia than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, heterozygous mutations in these genes are unlikely to predispose to fetal arterial thrombosis, and there is no correlation between the incidence of intestinal atresias and these thrombophilias across populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, there is no evidence to support routine screening for thrombophilias in infants with intestinal atresia or their mothers. Other thrombophilias such as antithrombin deficiency have stronger associations with thrombosis risk, but this is uncommon, and an association with intestinal atresia has not been explored. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for inherited thrombophilia in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>Finally, genetic factors may play a role in a few cases. Although most cases of intestinal atresia are sporadic, familial cases of apple peel atresia have been reported, suggesting a genetic component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A rare familial syndrome of multiple intestinal atresias (Type IV) has been described (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/243150&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWHU99ZjJhWDiVwqtOHRShm/RXhY+gvCfTYkfTRNpbCbO&amp;TOPIC_ID=5863\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #243150</a>). Some cases are associated with either mild or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and are attributable to mutations in the <em>TTC7A</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Another familial syndrome consists of jejunal atresia with ocular chamber abnormalities and microcephaly (Str&oslash;mme syndrome, <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/243605&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWAdDHUEl1SmyDOUVoJ4bJ0Ixwyhl+lwgmkJD24fxRtFG&amp;TOPIC_ID=5863\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #243605</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonic atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of colonic atresia is unknown, but most authorities believe it is the same as for small bowel atresia. Colonic atresia may occur in combination with Hirschsprung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal atresia may present with suspicious findings on prenatal ultrasound, or with clinical symptoms that develop shortly after birth. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2106910268\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less than one-half of infants with intestinal atresias are identified by prenatal ultrasound examination, based on signs of intestinal obstruction. If an abnormality is detected in prenatal ultrasound, this knowledge enhances clinical care, because infants can be treated promptly after birth, reducing the risk of complications of poor feeding and vomiting, including volume depletion, electrolyte imbalance, and aspiration pneumonia. However, routine prenatal ultrasound has low sensitivity for detecting gastrointestinal atresias, especially because sonographic signs of obstruction may not become evident until the late second trimester, after the typical time of a fetal anatomic survey. The sensitivity tends to decrease for more distal lesions: in one study, prenatal ultrasound detected about 50 percent of duodenal obstructions, 40 percent of jejunal or ileal obstructions, and 30 percent of colonic obstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition to low sensitivity, ultrasound is not able to accurately identify the number and location of obstructions and has limited ability for assessing the viability of unobstructed distal bowel, and many of the findings are nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Plain radiographs and contrast examinations should be obtained after birth to confirm the diagnosis and better define the atresia, if present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-of-esophageal-gastrointestinal-and-anorectal-atresia#H456610916\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis of esophageal, gastrointestinal, and anorectal atresia&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic performance of ultrasound imaging'</a>.) </p><p>Duodenal atresia usually has the characteristic double bubble appearance on prenatal ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70937\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70937 \">image 1</a>), which is similar to the postnatal abdominal radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73385\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73385 \">image 2</a>). This finding is due to dilation of the stomach and the first part of the duodenum. Polyhydramnios develops in up to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These findings typically develop in the mid to late second trimester. Duodenal atresia is particularly difficult to distinguish from choledochal cyst by antenatal ultrasonography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-of-esophageal-gastrointestinal-and-anorectal-atresia#H24138532\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis of esophageal, gastrointestinal, and anorectal atresia&quot;, section on 'Duodenal atresia'</a>.)</p><p>Jejunal and ileal atresias may present with polyhydramnios, ascites, dilated bowel loops, and increased bowel echogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Lesions in the proximal small bowel (jejunum) are more likely to be detected compared with distal lesions (ileum), because they result in more severe dilation of the proximal bowel due to continuing fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid, which outpaces intestinal absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-of-esophageal-gastrointestinal-and-anorectal-atresia#H24138590\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis of esophageal, gastrointestinal, and anorectal atresia&quot;, section on 'Jejunal and ileal atresia'</a>.)</p><p>Colonic atresias are unlikely to be detected on prenatal ultrasound unless they are associated with additional more proximal atresias or other congenital anomalies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-of-esophageal-gastrointestinal-and-anorectal-atresia#H2209263\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis of esophageal, gastrointestinal, and anorectal atresia&quot;, section on 'Colonic atresia'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2923202046\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal presentation and associated anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal atresia presents with symptoms and signs of intestinal obstruction, including abdominal distension, vomiting, and often with failure to pass meconium. Vomiting usually begins in the first 24 to 48 hours after birth, and is usually bilious. Most infants with intestinal atresia are born at or near term. Those with duodenal atresia or other proximal obstruction tend to be small for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>The type and timing of these symptoms varies with the location of the obstructing lesion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duodenal atresia</strong> &ndash; Infants with duodenal atresia or stenosis typically have gastric distension and vomiting that is often but not always bilious. Affected infants may pass meconium. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Duodenal atresia is an isolated finding in one-third to one-half of cases. In approximately 30 percent of cases it is associated with Down syndrome, or occasionally with another chromosomal anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Conversely, approximately 2.5 percent of patients with Down syndrome have duodenal atresia or stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Even among infants with a normal karyotype, duodenal atresia is often associated with other structural malformations, including cardiac, gastrointestinal (biliary atresia, agenesis of the gall bladder), renal, limb, and vertebral anomalies. In one study, among infants with duodenal atresia and a normal karyotype, 12 percent had cardiac anomalies, 8 percent had gastrointestinal anomalies, and 7 percent had urinary system anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Jejunal and ileal atresia</strong> &ndash; Affected infants typically develop abdominal distension and vomiting within the first two days after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Emesis usually is bilious. Most infants with bowel obstruction fail to pass meconium. However, meconium may remain in the distal bowel beyond the obstruction. As a result, newborns with jejunal or ileal atresia may pass meconium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A minority of infants with jejunal or ileal atresias have associated chromosomal anomalies (&lt;5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Jejunal atresia is sometimes associated with other major malformations (eg, cardiac malformations, 10 to 20 percent, and other gastrointestinal malformations such as gastroschisis), but this is rare in ileal atresias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36</a>]. Jejunal or ileal atresia is also associated with cystic fibrosis (10 of 83 infants in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], due to inspissated meconium and volvulus during fetal life, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Jejunal and ileal atresia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Colonic atresia</strong> &ndash; Like other types of bowel obstruction, colonic atresia presents with marked abdominal distension, failure to pass meconium, and bilious vomiting. Because the obstruction is distal, symptoms may appear later than with more proximal lesions, although usually within the first three days after birth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Colonic atresia typically affects otherwise normal newborns. In rare cases, it may be associated with gastroschisis, skeletal abnormalities, other intestinal atresias, and Hirschsprung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/26,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,37</a>]. Cases have been reported with congenital varicella syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p>In infants with partial intestinal obstruction (stenosis), the presentation may be more insidious, with obstructive symptoms developing days or weeks after birth. In some cases the symptoms are intermittent, causing further delay in diagnosis.</p><p>Intestinal obstruction reduces enteric excretion of bilirubin and often results in jaundice. Serum bilirubin concentration frequently is higher with small than with large bowel obstruction.

This sign may be obscured by excessive fluid in the stomach. In that case, aspiration of the stomach through a nasogastric tube and injection of 30 to 60 mL of air may confirm the diagnosis. Although duodenal atresia is the most common cause of high-grade duodenal obstruction in neonates, other problems such as malrotation with volvulus, jejunal duplication, or colonic duplication can present with similar findings on plain radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An air-fluid level in the duodenum is nonspecific, but one important cause is duodenal atresia or duodenal stenosis, which causes only partial obstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels are characteristic of jejunal or ileal atresia on plain abdominal radiographs typically consists of dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels.

If surgery will be delayed because of extreme prematurity, metabolic disturbance, or another anomaly, it is particularly important to perform contrast radiography to rule out malrotation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The signs of malrotation on upper gastrointestinal contrast studies include low-lying or displaced duodenojejunal junction and coiling of the bowel with partial or complete mechanical obstruction. Infants with this finding should be taken urgently to surgery. At surgery for malrotation, intrinsic bowel obstruction should always be excluded by passing saline or a catheter through the duodenum into the upper jejunum, because malrotation is often associated with duodenal atresia or stenosis.

In this case, contrast radiography is not essential, provided that the infant is taken to surgery promptly for definitive diagnosis and repair. If contrast radiography is performed, duodenal atresia is demonstrated by a dilated stomach and duodenum and lack of distal bowel gas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64334\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64334 \">image 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contrast enema</strong> &ndash; Unless the radiograph and upper gastrointestinal contrast study are diagnostic of duodenal atresia or malrotation with midgut volvulus, a contrast enema should be performed. The goal is to identify the site of atresia or to identify another cause of obstruction such as Hirschsprung disease. In most cases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> can be used to perform the contrast enema.

In small bowel atresia, it is not possible to reflux contrast medium into the dilated loops of more proximal bowel. A microcolon may also be present in meconium ileus. In that case, contrast medium can often be injected retrograde into the proximal dilated ileum and may demonstrate typical intraluminal filling defects caused by abnormal meconium. A contrast enema can also reveal evidence of colonic atresia or Hirschsprung disease.

Intravenous hydration should be provided and abnormalities in fluid and electrolyte balance corrected. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a>) are typically given, to prevent postoperative infection. </p><p>If the infant is ill and malrotation and volvulus have been excluded by contrast radiography, immediate surgery for intestinal atresia is not necessary. The operation can be postponed until metabolic, cardiac, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory abnormalities have been diagnosed and treated and the patient is in optimal condition. However, the risks of deferring surgery include vomiting and aspiration, sepsis, and complications of prolonged <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgical approach depends upon the site of the atresia. In every case, the possibility of a second or multiple atresias should be considered. With a proximal obstruction, distal atresias may be overlooked at operation, especially if they are not associated with a gap in the bowel or mesentery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Duodenal atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duodenal atresia is approached through a transverse right upper quadrant incision. Duodenal atresia can also be repaired laparoscopically, but this approach has not been widely adopted. The best and safest procedure is an end-to-side or side-to-side duodenoduodenostomy. A duodenojejunostomy is also acceptable. During surgery, a small catheter should be passed into the distal bowel. Either air or saline should be injected through the entire small bowel to rule out additional stenoses or atresias.</p><p>In cases of stenosis or atresia due to a persistent membrane, we usually perform a duodenoduodenostomy. We do not resect the obstructing membrane because of the possibility of damaging the common bile duct or pancreatic duct. However, others recommend excision of the web.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Jejunal and ileal atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jejunal and ileal atresias can be approached through a transverse incision below or just above the umbilicus. Some surgeons prefer a transumbilical approach to minimize the scar from the incision. Primary repair usually is best. In most, a simple end-to-end or end-to-back anastomosis can be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In patients with jejunal atresia, the proximal segment of bowel usually becomes dilated due to peristalsis proximal to the obstruction. This dilated segment may cause technical difficulties with the anastomosis. In addition, it may lead to functional obstruction after the repair due to ineffective peristalsis, which may result because the dilation prevents apposition of the bowel mucosa as peristaltic waves pass through it and because muscle activity is poorly coordinated. Therefore, in order to minimize dysfunction at the site of the anastomosis, some surgeons taper or resect the most dilated proximal bowel.</p><p>Primary repair is preferred if multiple atresias are present and care is taken to preserve intestinal length. In cases with short segments between atretic lesions, it may be preferable to resect the entire section of involved bowel rather than perform multiple anastomoses, provided that this will leave an adequate length of bowel. Adequate bowel length is considered to be at least 30 cm of jejunum and ileum with an intact ileocecal sphincter, but ideally more than 75 cm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Small bowel atresia and gastroschisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several approaches to the management of small bowel atresia associated with gastroschisis. A primary repair can be performed at the time of reduction of the bowel and closure of the abdominal wall. Alternatively, surgical correction can be delayed until several weeks after reduction of the bowel and repair of the gastroschisis. A third approach is to make a stoma at the time of abdominal wall repair and defer reanastomosis of the bowel until the infant is older.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Colonic atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary repair often is technically feasible in colonic atresia. If this approach is taken, we suggest obtaining a suction rectal biopsy prior to the primary repair, to rule out Hirschsprung disease. However, a better approach may be to exteriorize the proximal colon as a colostomy and defer anastomosis until the child is several months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This approach allows time for a rectal biopsy to rule out Hirschsprung disease. It may preserve bowel length by allowing the proximal colon to shrink back to a more normal size and to recover its tone. This may avoid unnecessary resection of the proximal colon and preserve its ability to absorb salt and water. Most babies thrive with a colostomy and can be discharged earlier from the hospital than with a primary repair. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following surgery, intravenous hydration and nasogastric or orogastric drainage should be provided until bowel function returns. In most cases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) is started within 24 to 48 hours of surgery and continued until oral feeding is established, which is usually possible in three to five days.</p><p>Most infants recover uneventfully following repair of intestinal atresia. Repair of duodenal atresia may be complicated by delayed emptying of the duodenum. Reoperation is indicated only when radiographic studies demonstrate obstruction, but should not be attempted for at least three weeks following the initial surgery. </p><p>Patients with atresia associated with meconium ileus due to cystic fibrosis require appropriate treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for intestinal atresia is very good. Most of the mortality occurs in infants with medical conditions such as prematurity or respiratory distress syndrome, associated anomalies, or complications such as short gut syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/32,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,45</a>]. As an example, in a series of 277 newborns with intestinal atresia and stenosis treated from 1972 to 1997 in Indiana, long-term survival for duodenal atresia, jejunoileal atresia, and colonic atresia was 86, 84, and 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similar results were reported in a series of 83 patients with jejunoileal atresia and without gastroschisis born from 1976 to 1998 in the United Kingdom, with overall survival of 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The major causes of morbidity and mortality are short bowel syndrome and cardiac anomalies, often associated with duodenal atresia, especially in infants with Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>]. The prognosis of newborns with meconium ileus is similar to other children with cystic fibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis of complex atresias depends upon the length and function of the remaining bowel. Bowel function determines the required duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) with its associated risks of sepsis and liver failure. Patients at especially high risk for short bowel syndrome include those with Type IIIB and IV atresias and gastroschisis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Late operative complications include recurrent obstruction from anastomotic dysfunction, stricture, and adhesions, and are more likely to occur in complex atresias. Anastomotic dysfunction often complicates the recovery of infants with type IIIB (apple peel) atresia, who usually require prolonged TPN and may develop cholestasis and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Despite these complications, contemporary surgical techniques and newborn intensive care have improved survival in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-atresia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20612231\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal atresia, a congenital complete obstruction of the lumen of the intestine, is one of the most frequent causes of bowel obstruction in the newborn, and can occur at any point in the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately one-half of the cases involve the duodenum; most other cases affect the jejunum or ileum, with a small percentage in the colon. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duodenal atresia is thought to be caused by an interruption of normal gastrointestinal tract development. Jejunal and ileal atresias are acquired in utero, resulting from vascular disruption leading to ischemic necrosis of the fetal intestine. Causes of the vascular disruption include intestinal volvulus, intussusception, internal hernia, gastroschisis, meconium ileus, and interruption of the segmental mesenteric blood supply.
