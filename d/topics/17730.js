HCAP referred to pneumonia acquired in healthcare facilities such as nursing homes, hemodialysis centers, and outpatient clinics or during a hospitalization within the past three months. The rationale for the separate designation of HCAP (and its association with HAP) was that patients with HCAP were thought to be at higher risk for MDR organisms. However, several studies have shown that many patients defined as having HCAP are not at high risk for MDR pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>] and that this designation is not a good predictor of who will have an infection with an MDR organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Furthermore, although interaction with the healthcare system is potentially a risk for MDR pathogens, underlying patient characteristics (recent receipt of antimicrobials, comorbidities, functional status, and severity of illness) are important independent determinants of risk for MDR pathogens. In addition, there is no evidence to indicate that treating patients with HCAP according to the recommendations in HAP guidelines improves outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We feel that patients previously classified as having HCAP should be managed in a similar way to those with CAP (assessing risks for MDR organisms) because patients with HCAP frequently present from the community and are initially cared for in emergency departments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE SITE OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining whether a patient with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be safely treated as an outpatient or requires admission to an observation unit, general medical ward, or higher acuity level of inpatient care, such as an intensive care unit (ICU), is an essential first step (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113076\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113076 \">algorithm 1</a>).

However, many observational studies have suggested that beta-lactam plus macrolide combination regimens are associated with better clinical outcomes in patients with severe CAP, possibly due to the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibiotic studies for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Combination therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Furthermore, the severity of adverse effects (including the risk for <em>C. difficile</em> infection) and the risk of selection for resistance in colonizing organisms are generally thought to be greater with fluoroquinolones than with the combination therapy regimens.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Medical ward'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hospitalized patients requiring ICU care, we suggest initial combination therapy with an anti-pneumococcal beta-lactam (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftaroline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftaroline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a>) <strong>plus</strong> intravenous (IV) therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who cannot take azithromycin, we suggest a respiratory fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>) for the second agent (ie, in combination with a beta-lactam) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with MRSA risk factors, we suggest the addition of <strong>either</strong> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours, adjusted to a trough level of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and for renal function; in seriously ill patients, a loading dose of 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> may be given) <strong>or</strong> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> (600 mg IV every 12 hours) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F112544\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112544 \">algorithm 3</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients at risk for <em>Pseudomonas</em> or drug-resistant pathogens, coverage for these pathogens should be included. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Intensive care unit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of glucocorticoids as adjunctive treatment for CAP is controversial. We consider the potential benefits and risk of adjunctive glucocorticoids in each patient and administer glucocorticoids when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with CAP who have evidence of an exaggerated or dysregulated host inflammatory response, defined as sepsis or respiratory failure with an FiO<sub>2</sub> requirement of &gt;50 percent plus one or more of the following features (metabolic acidosis with an arterial pH of &lt;7.3, lactate &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> or a C-reactive protein &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L),</span> we suggest giving adjunctive glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). These patients are at high risk of mortality and are likely to benefit. Reasons to avoid glucocorticoids in such patients include risk factors for severe adverse events such as recent gastrointestinal bleeding, poorly controlled diabetes, or severe immunocompromise. We also avoid glucocorticoids in patients with CAP known to be caused by a viral pathogen such as influenza or a fungal pathogen such as <em>Aspergillus</em>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For other hospitalized patients, we make the decision to give adjunctive glucocorticoids on a case-by-case basis but generally find that the potential for harm outweighs the potential for benefit in patients who are at low risk for mortality. (See <a href=\"#H3950330468\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a pathogen has been established based upon reliable microbiologic methods, we favor narrowing therapy (&quot;de-escalation&quot;) to target the specific pathogen in order to avoid antibiotic overuse. (See <a href=\"#H1580481660\" class=\"local\">'Narrowing therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be switched from intravenous to oral therapy when they are hemodynamically stable, demonstrate some clinical improvement (in fever, respiratory status, white blood count), and are able to take oral medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89822 \">algorithm 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Switching to oral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital discharge is appropriate when the patient is clinically stable from the pneumonia, can take oral medication, has no other active medical problems, and has a safe environment for continued care; patients do not need to be kept overnight for observation following the switch. Patients who have been discharged from the hospital with CAP should have a follow-up visit, usually within one week. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Duration of hospitalization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H90511402\" class=\"local\">'Clinical follow-up after discharge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of treatment in patients with CAP who have a good clinical response within the first two to three days of therapy should generally be five to seven days. Longer treatment is indicated if the initial therapy was not active against the subsequently identified pathogen, if extrapulmonary infection is identified (eg, meningitis or endocarditis), or if the patient has documented <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>S. aureus</em>, or <em>Legionella </em>pneumonia or pneumonia caused by some less common pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89823\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89823 \">algorithm 5</a>). The duration of therapy in these patients should be individualized based upon the clinical response to treatment and patient comorbidities. For the treatment of MRSA pneumonia, we recommend a treatment duration of 7 to 21 days, depending upon the extent of infection and response to therapy; the shorter duration is recommended if the patient has a clear and early clinical response and no evidence of metastatic infection. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procalcitonin has been evaluated for guiding the decision to stop antibiotics since the procalcitonin level appears to correlate with the likelihood of a bacterial infection. We favor the use of procalcitonin to help guide the duration of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with clinical resolution after treatment do not require a follow-up chest radiograph. We perform chest radiograph at 7 to 12 weeks following treatment in patients &gt;50 years of age, particularly in males and smokers in this age group. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic response'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">File TM.
