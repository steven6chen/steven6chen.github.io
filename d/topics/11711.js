Chronic daily headache types with individual headaches of long duration (ie, four hours or more) include chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, hemicrania continua, and new daily persistent headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-daily-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic daily headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unique to the syndrome of new daily persistent headache (NDPH) is the fact that the headache begins one day and typically does not remit. Many patients can pinpoint the exact date their headache started. New daily persistent headache was first described in 1986 as a benign form of chronic daily headache that improved over time without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in other studies and in practice, NDPH can endure for many years or even decades and be completely refractory to treatment.</p><p>This topic will discuss NDPH. Other types of chronic daily headache are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-daily-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic daily headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of NDPH is poorly understood. Some but not all reports suggest that the onset of NDPH can be triggered by certain events.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective series of 56 patients, NDPH onset occurred at the time of an infection or flu-like illness, extracranial surgery, or a stressful life event in 30, 12, and 12 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a subsequent retrospective analysis of 97 patients with NDPH, 53 percent did not recognize a trigger, while factors identified as triggers included an infection or flu-like illness in 22 percent, a stressful life event in 9 percent, and a surgical procedure in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 40 children with NDPH, headache onset was linked with infection, minor head trauma, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and surgery in 43, 40, 10, and 10 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 30 adolescent and adult patients from Japan, no precipitating factors were elucidated in 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The observation that headache onset can occur in relation to infection or flu-like illness has triggered interest in a possible microbial etiology. However, the potential role of viral or other infection in NDPH pathogenesis (if any) remains to be determined.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study found evidence of active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in 27 of 32 patients (85 percent) with NDPH compared with 8 of 32 controls (25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The authors concluded that EBV reactivation might have a pathogenic role in NDPH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series of 56 patients found evidence of past EBV exposure in 13 percent, but no active infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of 18 NDPH cases, there was evidence of recent infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) in 6 patients, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 2, but no evidence of EBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of note, the positive cases for HSV or CMV had been seen within 60 days of headache onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an uncontrolled study of 108 cases of new daily headache, clinical or laboratory evidence suggestive of extracranial or systemic infections was detected in nearly all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mean headache duration was approximately 14 days, which is too short to meet current criteria for NDPH (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below). However, the study does alert the clinician that a new daily headache can be secondary to intracranial or extracranial infection and that further investigations may be warranted when appropriate.</p><p/><p>How an infection can cause NDPH is unknown. An activated autoimmune response that may lead to persistent neurogenic inflammation has been hypothesized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but remains unproven. In a study that evaluated 20 patients with NDPH and a control population of 18 patients (16 with chronic migraine and 2 with post-traumatic headache), elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine, were found in 95 percent of patients with NDPH and 100 percent of the control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No headache-free controls were investigated. Whether this cytokine plays a causal role in NDPH or other headaches remains unclear.</p><p>Only a minority of patients with NDPH has a history of prior headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Some individuals have a family history of headache, but there is no good evidence that NDPH is inherited.</p><p>To summarize, the link between NDPH and potential risk factors or inciting events such as infection, trauma, or surgery is not firmly established. These factors probably do not cause the headache, but rather may incite an underlying predisposition to headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An unanswered question is why the headache persists so long, even after the inciting factor has resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and prevalence of NDPH in the general population are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When compared with other primary headache disorders, NDPH appears to be rare, but it has been described in multiple ethnic groups, including white, black, Hispanic and Asian [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. </p><p>Studies from headache clinics suggest that NDPH is more frequent in children than in adults, and affects women more often than men.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 2232 new headache cases, 265 patients had &quot;chronic&quot; headache.

However, the ICHD-2 criteria did not reflect what was seen in clinical practice; a number of studies have reported that patients with NDPH frequently present with primarily migrainous symptoms (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Headache phenotype'</a> above), such as unilateral headache, photophobia, phonophobia, throbbing head pain, nausea, and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/2,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,18</a>]. Thus, the current ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria allow the diagnosis of NDPH even when migraine features are present alone or in combination with tension-type features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>New headache onset in the absence of a headache history always warrants attention. Therefore, the initial evaluation of acute NDPH must exclude secondary causes of headache. We recommend neuroimaging for patients with acute (within the first few weeks from onset) headache suspicious for NDPH. Where available, we suggest brain MRI with gadolinium as the initial imaging study. Head CT with contrast is an alternative for those who cannot have MRI because of intolerance, contraindications, or availability.</p><p>For select patients with recent onset of headache suspicious for NDPH, additional studies may be warranted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular imaging with MR venography is indicated in addition to brain MRI if there is suspicion for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When papilledema is present, the diagnosis of IIH is straightforward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A neuroimaging study is required to exclude other causes of elevated intracranial pressure. Brain MRI with and without contrast and postcontrast MR venography is the imaging study of choice. Lumbar puncture should follow MRI unless a source of elevated intracranial pressure is clearly delineated. An opening pressure greater than 250 mmH2O taken with the patient lying on the side with legs extended confirms elevated intracranial pressure. Pressures between 200 and 250 mmH2O are considered equivocal.

Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis.

Although chronic tension-type headache and NDPH have many similarities, NDPH is unique in that headache is daily and unremitting from, or almost from, the moment of onset, typically in individuals without a prior headache history. A clear recall of such an onset is necessary for the diagnosis of NDPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If strictly unilateral, hemicrania continua may be a more likely diagnosis than NDPH. A trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemicrania-continua\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemicrania continua&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combination of daily headaches in the setting of medication overuse may create diagnostic uncertainty. In this situation, one needs to ask about the temporal relationship between headache onset and the development of daily headache.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In NDPH, the headache is daily and unremitting from onset in a patient who is not yet overusing analgesics. Unlike medication overuse headache, the overuse in NDPH begins after the onset of daily headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, some patients with ongoing episodic migraine or tension-type headache progressively consume analgesics in an attempt to fight the gradually increasing headache frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The medication overuse begins before the onset of daily headache.</p><p/><p>Nevertheless, many NDPH sufferers are overusing analgesics by the time they are seen in clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>New daily persistent headache appears to have two subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-daily-persistent-headache/abstract/16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A self-limited form (nonpersisting), which typically resolves without therapy within several months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A refractory form (persisting) that is resistant to aggressive treatment regimens</p><p/><p>Very likely, the refractory form is the one seen in the clinician's office.

The pathophysiology is poorly understood. Some but not all reports suggest that the onset of NDPH can be triggered by certain events, such as infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence and prevalence of NDPH in the general population are unknown, but NDPH appears to be rare. Available evidence suggests that NDPH is more frequent in children than in adults, and affects women more often than men. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A characteristic feature of NDPH is that the headache starts rather abruptly and is daily and unremitting from, or almost from, the moment of onset, typically in individuals without a prior headache history. Considerable variability is seen in the clinical features. The pain in NDPH lacks specific features, and may be migraine-like, tension-type-like, or have elements of both. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of NDPH is clinical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76010 \">table 1</a>) and requires ruling out secondary causes of headache, even in the presence of a normal neurologic examination. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with recent onset of suspected NDPH, we recommend neuroimaging upon presentation. For select patients, additional studies may be warranted. A lumbar puncture is indicated if clinical features suggest a possible central nervous system infection or idiopathic intracranial hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of NDPH includes a number of secondary and primary causes of headache. It is particularly important to consider cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, headache secondary to spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), and giant cell arteritis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New daily persistent headache may take either of two subtypes: a self-limited one, or a persistent form which can last years or decades and is challenging to treat. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with primary NDPH, we suggest first classifying the phenotype of NDPH as most similar to either migraine or tension-type headache, and then treating with appropriate preventive headache therapy accordingly (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
