Abnormal cervical cytology requires further evaluation to exclude the presence of a precancerous or cancerous condition. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSIL in women ages 25 or older is followed up with colposcopy or immediate loop electrosurgical excision. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 25 and older'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recommendations for follow-up for abnormal cervical screening results differ for women ages 21 to 24 years from those for women 25 and older. These advise a diagnostic excisional procedure if abnormal results are severe or recurrent. In our practice, we also perform a diagnostic excisional procedure in these patients if adequate colposcopy cannot be achieved. This is because the risk of cervical cancer is low in this patient population. (See <a href=\"#H5967707\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 21 to 24'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women ages 21 to 24 with HSIL are evaluated with colposcopy. Further management depends on the results of colposcopy. (See <a href=\"#H5967707\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 21 to 24'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women with HSIL are evaluated with colposcopy. Endocervical curettage should not be done during pregnancy, but gentle sampling of the endocervical canal with a cytobrush may be performed. Cervical biopsy should be done only if a high-grade abnormality or cancer is suspected.
