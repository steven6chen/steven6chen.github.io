When fully expressed, the manifestations include irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, acne, and, frequently, obesity. The clinical manifestations of PCOS will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of, diagnostic criteria for, and treatment of PCOS are described in detail separately.

Its prevalence is strikingly similar across populations of women of reproductive age: 6.6, 6.8, and 6.7 percent in the southeastern United States, the Greek island of Lesbos, and Spain, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The epidemiology of PCOS is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and genetics of the polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to appreciate that PCOS is a syndrome, reflecting multiple potential etiologies and variable clinical presentations. Its key features are oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism. Other features are polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasonography, infertility due to oligoovulation, obesity, and insulin resistance.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 55 population-based studies from Europe, Australia, Asia, and the United States, the rates of hirsutism, hyperandrogenemia, polycystic ovaries, and oligoovulation were 13, 11, 28, and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552091663\"><span class=\"h1\">REPRODUCTIVE ABNORMALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Menstrual dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The menstrual dysfunction in PCOS is characterized by oligo- or amenorrhea, caused by infrequent or absent ovulation. The menstrual disturbances classically have a peripubertal onset. Affected women may have a normal or slightly delayed menarche followed by irregular cycles. Other women may apparently have regular cycles at first and subsequently develop menstrual irregularity in association with weight gain. Although the mechanism is not fully elucidated, many obese women with PCOS resume more regular menstrual cycles after relatively small amounts of weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H70413157\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Weight reduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261220481\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonadotropin dynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many, but not all, women with PCOS have abnormal gonadotropin secretory dynamics. Most commonly, there is an increase in mean luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52544 \">figure 1</a>) and in LH pulse frequency and amplitude when blood is sampled frequently (a minimum of every 10 minutes throughout the day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The likelihood of finding an elevation in serum LH depends upon the timing of the sample relative to the last menstrual period, the ovarian activity, the use of oral contraceptive (OC) pills, body mass index (BMI), and the frequency of LH sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, the absence of an elevated serum LH level does not exclude the diagnosis of PCOS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H1833412531\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The serum concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may be normal or low in PCOS, leading to an elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">LH/FSH</span> ratio compared with normally cycling, early follicular phase, young control women. However, neither an elevated serum LH concentration nor an increased <span class=\"nowrap\">LH/FSH</span> ratio is part of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been proposed that prenatal androgenization may program the female fetus to develop LH excess, ovarian and adrenal hyperandrogenism, amenorrhea, and insulin resistance at puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Genetic analyses suggest that women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of allelic differences in FSH beta chain gene that are associated with increased LH concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H185346940\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and genetics of the polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Endometrial cancer risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chronic unopposed estrogen exposure in PCOS may result in an excess risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma, although epidemiologic evidence for this association has been limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, a national cohort study that included over 12,000 women with PCOS (with no information on treatment history) reported an increased risk of endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the excess absolute risk was very small (1.3 per 10,000 women per year [for women under age 50 years]).</p><p>The reduction in ovulatory events in PCOS leads to deficient progesterone secretion. Thus, women with PCOS may have constant mitogenic stimulation of the endometrium (chronic estrogen stimulation, no progesterone for differentiation), leading to intermittent breakthrough bleeding and abnormal uterine bleeding (frequent or unusually heavy menstrual bleeding typically associated with anovulation).</p><p>Women with PCOS have other risk factors for endometrial cancer, including chronic hyperinsulinemia, increased serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) concentrations, hyperandrogenemia, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Although there is no consensus on monitoring for endometrial hyperplasia in these patients, one study suggested that in oligoovulatory women with PCOS, an endometrial thickness &lt;7 mm on transvaginal ultrasound was not associated with histologic evidence of endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552092007\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key ovarian findings in PCOS include multiple, small, preantral and antral follicles in a peripheral location, with an increased volume of stroma. Histologically, there is a thickened and sclerotic cortex of the ovary, giving the appearance of a smooth white capsule on gross examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552092013\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With new high frequency transvaginal ultrasonography, the histologic findings can be corroborated noninvasively. The historical ultrasound criteria for polycystic ovaries includes the presence of 8 to 10 small (2 to 8 mm) follicles in a peripheral array around an increased amount of stroma relative to the number of follicles; ovarian volume is also increased on average [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This classic appearance does not refer to large cysts that might rupture or cause pain.</p><p>A modified set of diagnostic criteria for PCOS (the Rotterdam criteria) has been published and is described in detail elsewhere. The Rotterdam ultrasound criteria include the presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2 to 9 mm in diameter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased ovarian volume (&gt;10 mL; calculated using the formula 0.5 x length x width x thickness). Ovarian volume and follicle number decrease with age in women with or without PCOS. Age-based criteria to define polycystic ovaries have therefore been proposed in women over age 40 years.

This was illustrated in a study of 68 nonhirsute women with normal menstrual cycles, 39 of whom had polycystic morphology on ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Serum total and free testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were higher in the early follicular phase in women with polycystic morphology compared with those with normal ovarian morphology. In addition, both fasting insulin and insulin resistance calculated from a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR or HOMA model: fasting glucose x fasting insulin) were higher in the women with polycystic morphology.</p><p>In a follow-up report from the same investigators, women with regular menstrual cycles and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound were not at increased risk for subsequent development of PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552092036\"><span class=\"h3\">Follicular development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follicular development and function are abnormal in PCOS ovaries, including abnormal patterns of follicular fluid hormone production (low follicular fluid estradiol concentrations and high levels of follicular fluid androgens) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>There are also abnormalities in the dynamics of follicular development. Growth of later (antral) stages of follicles tends to be arrested at 5 to 8 mm in diameter, much smaller than a mature follicle destined to ovulate.</p><p>Although there is evidence for an abnormal ovarian endocrine environment, it is also possible that there is an intrinsic defect in ovarian folliculogenesis. As an example, in a histologic study of ovarian cortical biopsies in women with polycystic ovaries (either anovulatory or ovulatory) and normal controls, the density of small preantral follicles was sixfold greater in anovulatory women with polycystic ovaries compared with normals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Within the preantral follicular pool, the percentage of early growing (primary) follicles was significantly greater, the percentage of primordial (resting) follicles significantly lower, and there was a trend towards a greater percentage of atretic follicles in the anovulatory polycystic ovary patients compared with controls. These findings suggest that, although there might be a greater initial pool of follicles in women with PCOS, a higher percentage get recruited and then become atretic.</p><p>Serum antim&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) is expressed by small (&lt;8 mm) preantral and early antral follicles; serum concentrations reflect the size of the primordial follicle pool. In adult women, AMH levels gradually decline with age (as the primordial follicle pool decreases) and become undetectable at menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In women with PCOS, mean AMH concentrations are high but overlap with those of age-matched women without PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 10 observational studies of women with PCOS, a serum AMH concentration &gt;4.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> had a specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing PCOS of 79 and 83 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In one study, serum concentrations of AMH were two- to threefold higher in women with PCOS compared with normal ovulatory women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, the number of small antral follicles detected on transvaginal imaging appears to be correlated with serum AMH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, an elevated AMH is not currently considered to be a criterion for the diagnosis of PCOS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552091708\"><span class=\"h2\">Anovulatory infertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with PCOS have infrequent ovulation and, therefore, take longer to conceive. Many, if not most, women who have PCOS and oligoovulation and desire fertility eventually undergo ovulation induction therapies. Women who have PCOS may have other reasons for infertility as well since they have, in comparison with women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, a reduced rate of conception relative to the rate of ovulation after therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate. Infertility was included in the original description of PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many studies have also described an increased rate of early pregnancy loss in PCOS, the mechanism of which is poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], but may be related to obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss&quot;, section on 'Polycystic ovary syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552092336\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of pregnancy complications is increased in women with PCOS. The spontaneous abortion rate in women with PCOS is 20 to 40 percent higher than the baseline in the general obstetric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 27 studies involving 4982 women with PCOS, the odds ratios (ORs) of developing GDM, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and preterm birth were 3.4, 3.4, 2.2, and 1.9, respectively, when compared with the general obstetric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, their babies had a higher risk of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (OR 2.3). Obesity, in the absence of PCOS, is also a risk factor for these complications. The risk of GDM is increased in women with PCOS independent of BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

This is manifested clinically by hirsutism, acne, and male-pattern balding. In rare instances, increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, or clitoromegaly may occur, but these findings are suggestive of other causes of virilization, such as hyperthecosis or a neoplasm of the ovary or adrenal gland. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-hyperthecosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian hyperthecosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hirsutism is defined as excess terminal (thick, pigmented) body hair in a male distribution and is commonly noted on the upper lip, chin, around the nipples (periareolar), and along the linea alba of the lower abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73544\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73544 \">picture 1</a>). The approach to evaluation and management of hirsutism is reviewed separately.

Two studies of peripubertal girls suggest that obesity contributes to the hyperandrogenemia as increasing body mass index (BMI) was associated with increases in serum total testosterone, free testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

In women who present with hyperandrogenic symptoms, we measure serum total testosterone concentrations because it provides the best overall estimate of androgen production in hirsute women. Although serum free testosterone may be the more sensitive test for the presence of hyperandrogenic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], currently available direct assays are inaccurate.

Total testosterone, free testosterone, and DHEAS concentrations were elevated in 38, 55.5, and 40 percent, respectively. Among women with PCOS, DHEAS is increased in approximately 16 percent of women who have normal total and free testosterone levels. A mildly elevated level in the setting of normal free testosterone is unlikely to affect management.

However, this study did not distinguish between polycystic morphology and true PCOS; thus, the applicability of these findings to women with PCOS is uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid ultrasound &ndash; A tendency toward atherosclerosis was also suggested in an ultrasonographic study of 125 women with PCOS and 142 normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

In a study of 36 premenopausal women (mean age 38 years) with PCOS, the presence of CAC was more common in PCOS patients when compared with a group of age- and weight-matched controls (39 versus 21 percent, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 2.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. However, after controlling for BMI, PCOS was no longer a predictor of CAC, suggesting that obese women with or without PCOS are at increased risk of atherosclerosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A higher prevalence of CAC was observed in PCOS women compared with controls in two additional reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. In one, components of the metabolic syndrome (low HDL and insulin resistance) appeared to mediate the association between PCOS and CAC, independently of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. In the second, the increase in risk appeared to be independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and markers of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p/><p>In summary, an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women with PCOS is not yet well established. Nevertheless, we recommend that all cardiovascular risk factors be considered for evaluation and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342300742\"><span class=\"h1\">VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral contraceptives (OCs), the mainstay of therapy for women with PCOS, are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in all users but particularly in women over age 40 years and those with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>Two studies based upon health insurance claims databases reported that PCOS itself appeared to be an additional risk factor for VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>]. However, both had important methodological limitations, and it cannot be determined whether the excess risk of VTE in this population was due to PCOS or the presence of obesity and other comorbidities. Neither study directly addressed the question of whether OC use disproportionately increases VTE risk in women with PCOS.</p><p>For most women with PCOS, the benefits of OCs still outweigh the potential risks of VTE. Thus, we still consider OCs to be first-line therapy for the management of hyperandrogenic symptoms, menstrual cycle control, and contraception.
