Although once produced from the plasma of alloimmunized women, the decreasing prevalence of D alloimmunization has necessitated the use of male donors who undergo repeated injections of D-positive red cells to develop high-titered polyclonal anti-D plasma. This dwindling resource has led to a search for a synthetic anti-D immunoglobulin, but none are available for clinical use.</p><p>Two monoclonal antibodies, BRAD-3 and BRAD-5, have been derived by immortalizing B lymphocyte cell lines from hyperimmunized donors with Epstein-Barr virus. A recombinant polyclonal human anti-D consisting of 25 different monoclonal IgG1 antibodies (Rozrolimupab [Sym001]; Symphogen) has also been developed by transfecting Chinese hamster ovary cells with human genes. Rozrolimupab is in phase III trials for the prevention of D alloimmunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Advantages of a synthetic product over products derived from humans include greater availability and elimination of risks of pathogen transmission and adverse reactions due to impurities in plasma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2737962798\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dose</strong> &ndash; A single 300 microgram dose (1 microgram = 5 international units) contains sufficient anti-D to suppress the immune response to 15 mL of D-positive red cells (or 30 mL fetal D-positive whole blood).

In a small proportion of patients, highly sensitive assays have detected residual anti-D antibody as long as 95 days after a routine antepartum injection of anti-D immunoglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and possibly as long as 180 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Fifteen to 20 percent of patients who receive anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks will have a low titer (&le;4) at term.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Persistence of the antibody can result in a positive direct antiglobulin test in the newborn but does not have adverse clinical effects. In one study, 20 percent of newborns whose mothers received D immunoglobulin at 34 weeks of gestation had a positive direct antiglobulin test, but hemoglobin and bilirubin levels were similar to controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1412272711\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism whereby anti-D immunoglobulin prevents D alloimmunization is unproven. Possibilities include rapid macrophage-mediated clearance of anti-D-coated red cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> down-regulation of antigen-specific B cells before an immune response occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. A significant number of D antigen sites on fetal red cells in the maternal circulation are not bound by passive anti-D immunoglobulin; therefore, epitope masking is not the reason anti-D responses are prevented by prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1130518191\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629295046\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection and allergic reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma units for making anti-D globulin are tested for antibodies to hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency viruses, hepatitis B virus, and parvovirus B19. Only units that test negative are used.</p><p>In addition, most anti-D immunoglobulin is processed by Cohn cold ethanol fractionation followed by viral-clearance ultrafiltration. This process is highly effective for removing viral particles, such as hepatitis A and C, parvovirus B12, and human immunodeficiency virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Anti-D immunoglobulin prepared by this method (eg, HyperRHO <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D,</span> RhoGAM, BayRho) must be administered intramuscularly because trace amounts of IgA and other plasma proteins in the product could cause severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions if administered intravenously to patients with antibodies to IgA.</p><p>Some anti-D immunoglobulin is prepared by ion exchange chromatography isolation. These preparations (eg, Rhophylac, WinRho SDF) are purer and can be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Intramuscular and intravenous preparations are equally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Allergic reactions to anti-D immunoglobulin are rare. As discussed above, some anti-D preparations may contain trace amounts of IgA.</p><p>Outbreaks of hepatitis C related to anti-D immunoglobulin administration have been reported in Germany and Ireland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These outbreaks were due to viral contamination of the drug, a risk that has been potentially eliminated by the inclusion of solvent detergent treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> filtration with micropore filters during the manufacturing process.</p><p>Thimerosal, a mercury preservative used to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination, had been used in anti-D globulin products in the past, but the US Food and Drug Administration mandated its removal from these products in 2001.</p><p>There is no evidence that anti-D immunoglobulin administration can transmit prions associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Available epidemiologic studies suggest that a history of preceding transfusion does not increase the risk of developing CJD. However, human-to-human transmission of prion diseases can occur under special circumstances, and low levels of infectivity have been noted when whole blood, serum, or buffy coat derived from patients with CJD is inoculated into animals. Therefore, as a precaution, all anti-D immunoglobulin used in the United Kingdom is manufactured from plasma from the United States.

This approach is generally similar to that in other countries, with minor differences in available drug preparations, third-trimester timing of administration, and pregnancy complications warranting prophylaxis.

The blood test is accurate and inexpensive and, if antibodies are identified, interventions are available for predicting the risk for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) as well as diagnosing and treating severe fetal anemia.

Ideally, the injection is given after the sample is drawn; however, slow absorption from an intramuscular injection site should prevent detection of passively acquired antibody in maternal serum if the injection is given shortly before blood drawing. In the rare case of a newly positive antibody screen, administration of a single dose of anti-D immunoglobulin before test results are available would not worsen fetal anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540998109\"><span class=\"h3\">Women who may avoid prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin is administered to D-negative women when the fetus is, or may be, D-positive. It may be omitted if the biologic father of the baby is known with certainty to be D-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] or if cell-free DNA (cfDNA) results on maternal plasma suggest that the fetus is D-negative. Maternal anti-D antibody screening at 28 weeks of gestation may also be omitted.</p><p>The use of cfDNA to select appropriate candidates for antepartum prophylaxis has not become a standard in the United States, but the test is commercially available. Some authorities have argued in favor of it on an ethical basis since the universal prophylaxis approach subjects women to the costs and consequences of a drug treatment that has no benefit if the fetus is D-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>The feasibility of using cfDNA circulating in maternal plasma to determine fetal <em>RHD</em> genotype and guide administration of prophylaxis has been shown in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-36</a>]. Testing is performed after 11 weeks of gestation. The odds of correctly identifying <em>RHD</em>-positive and <em>RHD</em>-negative fetuses increases significantly with gestational age after 11 weeks, so testing is best avoided earlier in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 30 studies of cfDNA for <em>RHD</em> determination (n = 10,290 tests), sensitivity was 99.3 percent (95% CI 98.2- 99.7) and specificity was 98.4 percent (95% CI 96.4-99.3) for pregnancies tested in the first and second trimesters; sensitivity with real-time quantitative PCR was higher than with conventional PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>ACOG does not recommend the use of cell-free fetal DNA for fetal <em>RHD</em> testing to determine the need for antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. They do, however, state that, as the cost of the assay in the United States declines, this practice may become an attractive strategy. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England recommends fetal&nbsp;<em>RHD</em>&nbsp;genotype as a cost-effective option to guide antenatal prophylaxis with antiD immunoglobulin, if the overall cost of testing is &pound;24 or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. An Australian study concluded that <em>RHD</em> genotyping was an economically sound option for Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>In several countries (eg, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, England, France, Finland) fetal <em>RHD</em> determination is performed routinely in D-negative women and administration of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin is avoided when an <em>RHD</em>-negative fetus is identified. Over one-third of D-negative women appropriately avoided antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin in large studies from Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Postnatal cord blood typing is no longer performed in the Netherlands and Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]: Postnatal prophylaxis is administered based on the prenatal fetal <em>RHD</em> screening result, given the low rate of false negatives (0.03 percent [95% CI 0.01-0.06 percent] in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]). However, we recommend neonatal blood typing. (See <a href=\"#H969943237\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis after delivery'</a> below.)</p><p>Selective administration of anti-D immunoglobulin based on cfDNA results has the potential to increase the number of cases of D alloimmunization when compared with universal antenatal prophylaxis because of the possibility of a false-negative result. A false-negative result (an <em>RHD-</em>positive fetus incorrectly identified as <em>RHD</em>-negative) is of concern since antepartum anti-D immunoglobulin would be omitted and could potentially result in antepartum alloimmunization. If antepartum prophylaxis is based on cfDNA results, it has been estimated that 1:86,000 D-negative women would have a future pregnancy affected by HDFN that could have been prevented by universal antepartum prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. One additional case of fetal or neonatal loss or developmental problems would occur per 860,000 D-negative pregnant women. The risk is extremely low because most alloimmunization develops as a result of delivery, and newborn cord blood testing would detect fetuses falsely genotyped as <em>RHD</em>-negative, enabling postpartum maternal administration of anti-D immunoglobulin. </p><p>Inconclusive and false-positive (an <em>RHD-</em>negative fetus incorrectly identified as <em>RHD</em>-positive) cfDNA results are not a major concern because antepartum anti-D immunoglobulin would be administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2465768943\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single dose of 300 micrograms of anti-D immunoglobulin is administered at approximately 28 weeks of gestation.</p><p>Other countries use a two-dose regimen.

(See <a href=\"#H2296257206\" class=\"local\">'Screening for anti-D antibodies at the first prenatal visit'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1813450871\" class=\"local\">'Preadministration antibody screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive fetal <em>RHD </em>genotyping is the standard approach in some countries. In the United States, it may be an option when a patient has concerns about receiving unnecessary anti-D immunoglobulin. (See <a href=\"#H3540998109\" class=\"local\">'Women who may avoid prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The following recommendations apply to women who are D-negative and whose fetus is, or may be, D-positive:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend routine administration of anti-D immunoglobulin early in the third trimester (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The optimum dose regimen in the United States is 300 micrograms at 28 weeks of gestation; other countries use 100 to 120 micrograms at 28 and 34 weeks. This practice reduces the incidence of antenatal alloimmunization from 1 to 2 percent to 0.1 to 0.3 percent. (See <a href=\"#H111877557\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis at 28 weeks of gestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend administration of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin when there is an increased risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Some examples include miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, multifetal reduction, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, blunt abdominal trauma, external cephalic version, antepartum bleeding, and fetal death. We administer 300 micrograms as soon as possible within 72 hours of the event. (See <a href=\"#H2486497451\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis after antepartum events associated with placental trauma or disruption of the fetomaternal interface'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the small fetal blood volume before 20 weeks of gestation, testing for fetomaternal hemorrhage to confirm appropriate dosing after a potentially sensitizing event is unnecessary in this gestational age range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Repeat dosing for situations where there may be an ongoing risk for fetomaternal hemorrhage (such as chronic placental abruption or placenta previa with intermittent vaginal bleeding) can be managed with serial determinations of the maternal indirect Coombs every three weeks with repeat dosing if it is found to be negative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend administration of anti-D immunoglobulin within 72 hours of delivery of an D-positive infant (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We administer 300 micrograms and also test for excessive fetomaternal hemorrhage in case additional doses are needed. (See <a href=\"#H969943237\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis after delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If anti-D immunoglobulin is inadvertently omitted after delivery, it is administered as soon as possible after recognition of the omission. Partial protection is afforded with administration within 13 days of the birth, and there may be an effect as late as 28 days after delivery. (See <a href=\"#H2331010514\" class=\"local\">'Anti-D immunoglobulin is inadvertently omitted'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a typical D-sensitized patient, the D antibody titer exceeds that of C. If the anti-C titer equals or exceeds the anti-D titer, the clinician should consider the possibility that the anti-D antibody is actually anti-G antibody. Consultation with a blood bank pathologist is indicated for specialized testing for anti-D antibody. If specialized testing only detects anti-C and anti-G, the patient is at risk for D alloimmunization and standard indications for the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin should be followed. (See <a href=\"#H903871514\" class=\"local\">'False-positive anti-D antibody screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine administration of antepartum and postpartum anti-D immunoglobulin has reduced the prevalence of D alloimmunization to 0.1 to 0.3 percent of D-negative pregnant women. Reasons for continued occurrence of sensitized pregnancies include both failure to administer anti-D immunoglobulin in accordance with published guidelines and sensitization early in gestation before administration of routine third-trimester antenatal anti-D prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H3362152213\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stasi R.
