It is reasonable to not use preprocedural anticoagulation in AF patients in sinus rhythm (and who are likely to remain in sinus rhythm for three weeks prior to the procedure) with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASC score of 0.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Periprocedural</strong> &ndash; We continue VKA in the periprocedural period. For most patients taking once-a-day NOACs, we hold the dose the day before and the morning of the procedure. For twice-a-day NOACs, some of our experts hold both doses the day before the procedure while others hold only the evening dose before the procedure; no drug is given the morning of the procedure. Uninterrupted NOAC may be reasonable for the uncommon patient who is at very high risk of a periprocedural stroke. Studies support the fact that uninterrupted NOACs may be superior to uninterrupted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. All patients receive a continuous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH); the activated clotting time is maintained at greater than 300 seconds during the procedure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Post procedural </strong>&ndash; UFH is stopped at the end of the procedure and the sheaths are pulled when the activated clotting time is &lt;180 to 200 seconds. <br/><br/>For patients previously taking a VKA, the next dose is given approximately 24 hours after the prior dose. For those patients in whom the international normalized ratio was &lt;2.0 prior to the procedure, we restart UFH without a bolus six hours after sheath pull, increase the oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> the night of the procedure, and we continue UFH until the INR is 2.0. Another reasonable approach is to stop UFH the morning after the procedure and start low molecular weight heparin, usually at half the normal dose (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> twice daily) to avoid bleeding. <br/><br/>For patients previously taking a NOAC, we suggest restarting it - six hours after sheath removal (and in the absence of any related bleeding). Some experts give intravenous heparin (no bolus; drip at 1000 to 1200 units per hour) or low molecular weight heparin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> starting six hours after sheath pull, that is uncomplicated by bleeding, and continue until the morning after the ablation. Other experts no longer give a heparin after sheath pull. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-term </strong>&ndash; We continue oral therapy with the previously prescribed oral anticoagulant for two to three months regardless of CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. After this period, the decision to continue on long-term anticoagulation is based on the patients underlying stroke risk regardless of whether rhythm control has been achieved. For those patients whose risk for embolization is very low, such as those with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 0 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>), we stop anticoagulation at the two-to-three-month visit. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1041763951\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE, TIMING, AND MECHANISM OF EMBOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or other manifestation of embolization is increased at the time of catheter ablation (CA) and is in the range of 0.4 to 2.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Thus, many patients will be receiving anticoagulation when scheduled for catheter ablation (CA) and should continue their anticoagulant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.) </p><p>For patients <strong>not</strong> taking long-term anticoagulant therapy due to a low risk of stroke, there are no studies that have compared differing anticoagulant strategies prior to CA; thus, the optimal preprocedural anticoagulation strategy is not known. For these patients, including those in sinus rhythm, most of our experts carry out a minimum of three weeks of effective oral anticoagulation prior to the procedure. The rationale for doing so is that many episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) are asymptomatic and these episodes will have placed the patient at risk of embolization at the time of catheter manipulation. </p><p>We also believe it is reasonable to not use preprocedural anticoagulation in AF patients in sinus rhythm (and who are likely to remain in sinus rhythm for three weeks prior to the procedure) with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 0. <br/><br/>When three weeks of effective anticoagulant therapy has not been carried out, preprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed (see <a href=\"#H27274689\" class=\"local\">'Role of TEE'</a> below); patients with evidence of left atrial thrombus are not candidates for CA unless it resolves with anticoagulation. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377978602\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anticoagulant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients started on oral anticoagulant therapy prior to catheter ablation, we prefer one of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) group to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. This preference is based on our preference for these agents in the general AF population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H960699950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Our approach to anticoagulation'</a>.) </p><p>Most but not all observational studies comparing one NOAC to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> have found similar efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/14-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-21</a>]. At least three meta-analyses of observational studies comparing warfarin to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> have come to similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. A 2016 meta-analysis of 25 studies (11,686 patients) comparing NOACs with uninterrupted VKAs found no significant difference in the rate of stroke or transient ischemic attacks (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 0.62-2.94) and major bleeding (odds ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.65-1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1463619036\"><span class=\"h2\">Switching oral anticoagulant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As stated directly above, we prefer one of the NOAC group to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for patients undergoing catheter ablation. For patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, there is no evidence that switching to NOAC prior to catheter ablation improves outcomes.

The presence of left atrial thrombus is a contraindication to the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Transthoracic echocardiography is not a replacement for TEE in this setting. Two reasons to perform TEE prior to (generally the day before) CA are that it adds significant length to the CA, and some complications of TEE, such as a retropharyngeal hematoma, can be aggravated by the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> used during the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography in detection of cardiac and aortic sources of systemic embolism&quot;, section on 'LA/LAA thrombi'</a>.) </p><p>We acknowledge that some experts will omit a TEE in the lowest-risk patients who have been taking effective anticoagulant therapy for at least three weeks, such as those in sinus rhythm who have no significant structural heart disease or those with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 0 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These experts often prefer that a pre-ablation magnetic resonance image confirms the absence of left atrial appendage thrombus in these patients who do not undergo preprocedural TEE. In a study of 97 patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation, contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrated 100 percent concordance with TEE for the presence and absence of left atrial appendage thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>An attempt to determine the need for preprocedural TEE in patients at low risk for embolization was made in an analysis of 1058 patients who had TEE performed within 24 hours of pulmonary vein isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The frequency of left atrial thrombus or sludge was evaluated according to the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score.

In the COMPARE trial, 1584 patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation#H541379272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'General classification'</a>) and CHADS<sub>2 </sub>score &ge;1 were randomly assigned to warfarin discontinuation two to three days before ablation and bridging with low molecular weight heparin (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> twice daily until the evening before the procedure) or continuation of therapeutic warfarin (three to four weeks with an INR 2.0 to 3.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The primary end point of the incidence of thromboembolic events (stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic thromboembolism) in the 48 hours after ablation occurred more frequently with warfarin discontinuation (4.9 versus 0.25 percent; odds ratio 13, 95% CI 3.1-55.6). The incidence of major bleeding complications was similar in the two groups (0.76 versus 0.38 percent, respectively). The majority of events occurred in patients with persistent AF. One limitation of the trial is that operators were not blinded to the anticoagulation strategy. </p><p>For patients in whom a strategy of continuous anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> has been chosen, the optimal immediate-preprocedural range for the INR is not known.

The incidence of the primary end point of major bleeding during and up to eight weeks after ablation was lower with dabigatran (1.6 versus 6.9 percent; absolute risk difference, -5.3 percentage points, 95% CI -8.4 to -2.2).

(See <a href=\"#H1041763951\" class=\"local\">'Incidence, timing, and mechanism of embolism'</a> above.) </p><p>We start with a loading dose of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> at the beginning of the procedure. Others start the loading dose before transeptal puncture, while others give half the dose before and half the dose after transeptal puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A continuous infusion is used to maintain the activated clotting time greater than 300 seconds; the first activated clotting time is performed 10 to 15 minutes after the loading dose. Heparin is stopped at the end of the procedure and the sheaths are pulled when the activated clotting time is &lt;180 to 200 seconds. Protamine can be given after the procedure before removing vascular sheaths. </p><p>Intracardiac echocardiography is done at the end of the CA procedure to ensure that there is no pericardial effusion.

(See <a href=\"#H276377316\" class=\"local\">'Preprocedural issues'</a> above.) There have been no studies comparing one approach to another and we suggest the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those previously taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, and for whom the management of the international normalized ratio was not problematic, we suggest continuing warfarin. The first postprocedural dose should be the day after the procedure, assuming a dose was given the morning of the procedure.

Low molecular weight heparin is continued until the international normalized ratio is therapeutic. When low molecular weight heparin is used, some of our experts give the first dose at 50 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients previously taking a newer oral anticoagulant (NOAC), we suggest restarting it no sooner than four to six hours after sheath removal (and in the absence of any related bleeding). Some experts delay restarting these newer agents until the morning after the procedure. If the NOAC is restarted the morning after the procedure, we give intravenous heparin (no bolus; drip at 1000 to 1200 units per hour) or low molecular weight heparin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> starting six hours after sheath pull and continue until the morning after the ablation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients previously not taking any oral agent, we suggest starting either a NOAC or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. A first dose of either agent can be given six hours after an uncomplicated procedure. Patients started on warfarin will need to receive bridging treatment for a few days with low molecular weight heparin, as described directly above. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191924377\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM ANTICOAGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We continue oral therapy with the previously prescribed oral anticoagulant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] for at least two months to ensure that the increased risk of embolization associated with the procedure, which lasts for about four weeks, has returned to a baseline risk and that there has been adequate time to document an absence of recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) for those patients in whom practitioners and patients are contemplating discontinuing anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

It is known that late recurrent AF occurs in 20 to 30 percent of patients, but the methods used in some studies likely underestimate the incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>].

In a retrospective study of 174 matched pairs of AF individuals with a CHA2DS2-VASc score &ge;1 who were treated with either antiarrhythmic drug therapy or CA and treated for at least three months with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, the rate of <span class=\"nowrap\">stroke/transient</span> ischemic attack was lower with the CA group (0.59 versus 2.21 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In those individuals treated with CA and in whom there was no AF recurrence, the stroke rate was very low compared to those with recurrence (0.8 versus 5.4 percent) after a mean follow-up period of 47 months. </p><p>In addition, it is not known if asymptomatic recurrences result in a persistent thromboembolic risk in patients who have undergone CA. A low risk of stroke was reported in a series of 755 patients with longstanding persistent AF who underwent CA or a tailored approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In this cohort, anticoagulation was discontinued three months after the procedure in the majority of the 522 patients who did not have evidence of recurrent AF. During a median follow-up of 25 months, none of the patients who stopped anticoagulation had a stroke. Although these results are encouraging, the study cohort had a low baseline thromboembolic risk, with most having a CHADS2-VASc score of 0 to 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>). Some of these patients, such as those with lone AF, would not require chronic oral anticoagulation whether or not they had a successful CA procedure.</p><p>Other observational evidence also suggests that not all patients with successful AF ablation require oral anticoagulation at discharge. In a study of 123 patients with CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores of 0 or 1 who underwent successful CA (with periprocedural heparin), there were no strokes or transient ischemic attacks at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>The following recommendations were made in the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/Heart</span> Rhythm Society AF guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic anticoagulation was recommended for at least two months in all patients following CA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After two months, the decision to continue anticoagulation should be based on the patient&rsquo;s risk factors for stroke and risk of bleeding, and not on the type of AF.
