Therefore, by definition the condition is only seen in growing children. In this setting, elevated levels of serum GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) cause rapid, excessive linear growth and, if unchecked, extremely tall adult stature. In contrast, GH excess that begins in adulthood, after complete epiphyseal fusion, has no effect on stature and is called acromegaly. Although many historical claims of gigantism have been exaggerated, case reports of true pituitary giants with heights of up to 8 feet 11 inches (272 cm) are documented in the medical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pituitary gigantism is a rare disorder. Most pediatric endocrinologists may see at most one or two patients with the condition during their careers. In one large series of 2367 children and adolescents with pituitary adenomas, only 15 (0.6 percent) had pituitary gigantism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although much of our understanding of this disease has been derived from isolated case reports and extrapolation from the adult literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], a retrospective review of 208 cases of pituitary gigantism from around the globe provides important insights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These include male predominance and a lack of identifiable genetic etiology in more than 50 percent of cases. Gigantism may occur at any age, and has been observed as early as the first two to three months of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pituitary gigantism typically is a sporadic and isolated condition. However, it may occur within the context of a coexisting disorder or arise according to a pattern of familial inheritance.</p><p>Syndromes in which gigantism is a well-recognized feature include McCune Albright Syndrome (MAS); multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1); multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4); Carney complex; and the paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma and pituitary adenoma association known as 3PA. Growth hormone excess has also been observed in the setting of neurofibromatosis and optic nerve tumors. The frequency of gigantism is established in only a subset of these conditions and varies significantly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 20 percent of patients with MAS are thought to have growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>], although few large case series are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one review of 112 patients with MAS and acromegaly, the mean age at diagnosis of acromegaly was just over 24 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Subclinical GH excess also has been reported in MAS, where it results in unexpected normal (rather than short) stature in the setting of untreated precocious puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

GH excess in MEN1 is extremely rare in individuals younger than 40 years, although it has been reported in a child as young as age five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. GH hypersecretion has also been reported as a feature of MEN4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], although the frequency of gigantism in this condition is unknown.

Affected individuals in these families have been as young as nine years of age at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess growth hormone (GH) can originate from a variety of sources including pituitary GH excess, hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) excess, or rarely, an ectopic source of GH or GHRH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51514\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51514 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In addition, dysregulation of neuroendocrine control mechanisms has been inferred from cases in which somatostatin-rich pathways have been disrupted, likely resulting in a diminished inhibitory constraint on GH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Upregulation of STAT3 resulting in GH hypersecretion has been implicated in the development of pituitary somatotroph adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Distinct biochemical and pathologic features differentiate GH overproduction in children and adults, suggesting that the disease behaves differently depending upon the age at which it begins. In adults, most cases are caused by a pituitary GH-secreting adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although pituitary adenomas can occur in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], early childhood-onset GH hypersecretion is thought to be more often caused by hypothalamic GHRH excess, which in several cases appears to have been present from, or even prior to, birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. When pituitary tumors are identified as the source of GH excess in children, they may be a manifestation of a genetic condition, whereas in adults they are usually an isolated abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In a study of 43 patients with gigantism, microduplications in this region were identified in 13 patients, all of whom had disease onset before five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Both familial (autosomal dominant) and sporadic cases have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Of note, XLAG in sporadic cases in boys may be caused by somatic mosaicism, and thus failure to identify Xp26.3 microduplications in peripheral blood does not rule out the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

In contrast, dramatic linear growth acceleration usually prompts initial investigation in children. Other growth parameters are affected as well. Mild to moderate obesity commonly accompanies tall stature in these patients.</p><p>In children with GH excess, the abnormal height growth typically precedes or is concurrent with rapid weight gain. In contrast, children with exogenous obesity typically have increases in weight percentile before changes in height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The mean onset of rapid growth in children with pituitary gigantism has been reported to be age 13, and occurs earlier in girls than in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition to linear growth acceleration, progressive macrocephaly also is seen in children with gigantism and may constitute the presenting complaint, particularly during infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Macrocephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of specific clinical features in children with gigantism is impossible to determine because the disorder is so rare. However, individual case reports indicate common characteristics including large hands and feet, coarsening of the facial features with frontal bossing and prognathism (projection of the jaw), and excessive sweating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. GH-secreting adenomas in adolescents are often associated with amenorrhea with or without galactorrhea in girls, and symptoms of tumor compression in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Coexisting endocrinopathies, common in adults, are not typically seen in children with GH excess, although cardiac morphologic and functional changes are felt to be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Oral glucose tolerance tests usually are normal. However, diabetic ketoacidosis as well as type 2 diabetes have been reported in adolescents with pituitary gigantism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children who present with tall stature do not have pituitary gigantism. Other etiologies of rapid linear growth (although not necessarily tall adult height), such as genetic tall stature, precocious puberty, or hyperthyroidism, should be carefully excluded. Dysmorphic facial features <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurocognitive problems may suggest a syndromic or chromosomal cause of tall stature (eg, Sotos, Weaver, Marshall-Smith, Klinefelter, or XYY syndrome). Coexisting disorders (eg, neurofibromatosis or MAS) also must be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The child with tall stature and/or abnormally rapid growth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Depending upon the clinical findings, initial evaluation may include determination of bone age, thyroid function tests, sex steroid hormone concentrations, karyotype, and GH-related studies. If initial biochemical testing suggests GH excess, a GH suppression test is used to make the definitive diagnosis of pituitary gigantism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentration is a valuable screening test in the evaluation for GH excess. Serum concentration of IGF-I is an indicator of endogenous GH secretion because synthesis of IGF-I is dependent upon GH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In addition, the concentration of IGF-I is constant, unlike the concentration of circulating GH, which varies widely throughout the day. Age-referenced norms for IGF-I concentration must be used because IGF-I concentrations rise gradually throughout childhood and are substantially higher during puberty than during the pre- or post-pubertal years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-growth-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of growth hormone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other GH-related peptides, such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), are elevated in patients with GH hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Prolactin usually is elevated in children with GH excess. This clinical feature is consistent with the pituitary histology in children with gigantism. The predominant pituitary cell type in children with gigantism is the mammosomatotroph, which secretes prolactin as well as GH; the predominant cell type in acromegaly is the somatotroph, which secretes GH alone. A single case of co-secretion of GH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) has been reported in a 13-year-old boy with a gigantism and a pituitary macroadenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>A GH suppression test, the gold standard for making a definitive diagnosis, should be performed if screening tests suggest GH excess. The GH suppression test measures the serum GH response to an oral glucose load. In normal individuals, GH concentration using immunoradiometric assays typically falls below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> within two hours of the glucose load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, the significant variability in GH immunoassays represents a challenge to the establishment of definitive consensus guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of GH disorders in the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>The GH suppression test may yield false positive results for some tall adolescents without GH hypersecretion. In one prospective study of 126 tall adolescents (height 3.1 &plusmn; 0.8 standard deviation score [SDS]), 31 percent of normal subjects failed to suppress GH concentrations in response to oral glucose load, even when the test was prolonged beyond 120 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Gender and pubertal status also affect the degree of GH suppression following an oral glucose load. Nadir growth hormone was found to be higher in girls than boys, and highest during Tanner stage 2-3 in both genders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Despite these variations, the vast majority of healthy pubertal children have a normal response to GH suppression test, with growth hormone concentrations suppressing to less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> after the glucose load.</p><p>Additional biochemical testing, although rarely necessary, includes stimulation tests using thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; which is no longer available in the United States) or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Administration of TRH or CRH typically induces a paradoxical response in the setting of GH hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Measurement of peripheral GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) also may be useful because its elevation is suggestive of ectopic GHRH secretion.</p><p>Enhanced recognition of genetic causes of GH excess has led to the development of screening protocols for specific mutations in patients with gigantism based on clinical features and family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic imaging of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland is undertaken once biochemical evidence of pituitary gigantism is confirmed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast is the study of choice because it has the ability to detect subtle abnormalities in the size and structure of the hypothalamic-pituitary region. In addition, MRI may reveal hypothalamic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> optic pathway gliomas in patients with GH excess associated with neurofibromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-gigantism/abstract/18,25,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25,63</a>].</p><p>Children with pituitary gigantism may have a variety of morphologic abnormalities that have important therapeutic implications.

It is characterized by elevated levels of serum GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), causing extreme growth acceleration and tall stature. In contrast, GH excess that begins in adulthood does not affect height and is called acromegaly. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pituitary gigantism is usually a sporadic and isolated abnormality. However, it may occur as one manifestation of a genetic syndrome such as McCune Albright Syndrome (MAS), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and type 4 (MEN1, MEN4), the paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma-pituitary adenoma association (3PA), and Carney complex. An inherited form of pituitary gigantism (familial somatotropinoma) also exists. Detection of genetic mutations as the basis for growth hormone excess can lead to earlier diagnosis and appropriate referrals for genetic counseling. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with pituitary gigantism have extraordinarily rapid linear growth and are frequently obese. However, the rapid growth in height typically precedes the development of obesity in children with GH excess. The condition is extremely rare, and other causes of rapid linear growth such as precocious puberty or hyperthyroidism should be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial screening tests in a child with suspected GH excess include serum concentrations of IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), and prolactin. Age-referenced norms for IGF-I concentration must be used. Depending upon the clinical findings, initial studies may include a bone age radiograph, thyroid function tests, sex steroid hormone concentrations, and a karyotype. If the results suggest GH excess, a GH suppression test is used to make the definitive diagnosis of pituitary gigantism. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a GH suppression test confirms GH hypersecretion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; with contrast) of the hypothalamus and pituitary should be performed to look for a pituitary adenoma or diffuse pituitary hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three therapeutic modalities for pituitary gigantism are surgery, radiation, and pharmacologic therapy. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice for discrete pituitary microadenomas or macroadenomas. Experience with pharmacologic agents in children with GH hypersecretion appears to be comparable with that observed in adults.
