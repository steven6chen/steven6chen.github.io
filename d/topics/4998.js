The term &quot;desmoid&quot; originates from the Greek word &quot;desmos,&quot; meaning band or tendon-like, and was first applied in the 1800s to describe tumors with a tendon-like consistency.</p><p>Although they lack the capacity to establish metastases, desmoids are locally aggressive and have a high rate of recurrence even after complete resection. Tumor-related destruction of vital structures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organs can be fatal, particularly when these tumors arise in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; Gardner syndrome).</p><p>This topic review will discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and local treatment options for desmoid tumors. Systemic therapy is discussed elsewhere, as are other miscellaneous benign diseases affecting soft tissue and bone, such as Gorham's disease, desmoplastic fibroma of bone, pigmented villonodular synovitis, keloids, and ganglion cysts.

The estimated incidence in the general population is two to four per million population per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Individuals between the ages of 15 and 60 are most commonly affected; desmoids are rare in the young and in the elderly. They are slightly more common in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and there is no significant racial or ethnic predilection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">FAP and Gardner syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most desmoids arise sporadically, although between 5 and 15 percent are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. FAP is caused by mutations in the <em>APC</em> (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene, located on chromosome 5q21-q22. Given that most desmoids that occur in the setting of FAP are abdominal (intraabdominal or abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]), some authors recommend screening for FAP in patients with intraabdominal or truncal desmoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, in our view, the risk of finding FAP in patients who develop a desmoid without a prior history of FAP is relatively low (4.8 percent in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]) and does not justify genetic screening for all individuals with an intraabdominal or truncal desmoid tumor. Screening might be more useful in the setting of multiple desmoids, which seem to cluster in the FAP group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-adenomatous-polyposis#H547090028\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>The development of desmoid tumors in patients with FAP was first described by Gardner in 1951 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54879\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54879 \">image 1</a>). Desmoid tumors affect between 10 to 20 percent of patients with FAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-14</a>]. The risk of developing a desmoid in a patient with FAP is 852 times that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although extremity desmoids can also occur, most of these patients develop abdominal tumors, one-half of which are intraabdominal, the remainder involving the abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other prominent extraintestinal lesions in these patients include osteomas and dermoid cysts. Families have been described who exhibit desmoids as the only manifestation of an <em>APC</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

With the increasing use of prophylactic colectomy, desmoid tumors have become an important cause of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. Desmoids are the cause of death in up to 11 percent of patients with FAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. However, progression is often gradual and approximately 60 percent are still alive 10 years after the diagnosis, some with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/7,8,22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,22,24</a>]. </p><p>Prognosis varies according to disease extent, although there is no consensus on the best way to quantify disease extent (see <a href=\"#H106560989\" class=\"local\">'Mortality associated with desmoids'</a> below). The desmoids that arise in patients with FAP have a particular predilection for surgical sites (eg, the mesentery or abdominal wall following colectomy, the site of an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis), and prior surgery is a risk factor for the development of desmoids in these families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/6,17-19,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17-19,25-28</a>]. In one series, prior abdominal surgery had been performed in 68 percent of patients with FAP and abdominal desmoid tumors; lesions developed within five years after surgery in approximately one-half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One patient in particular dramatically demonstrated this association with surgery. She had been treated, apparently successfully, with chemotherapy for an intraabdominal desmoid tumor. To confirm the response, laparoscopy was performed. Within months, desmoid tumors began developing in each of the three trocar sites; the tumors became massive and inoperable and led to the death of the patient. </p><p>The only other described risk factors in these kindreds are a family history of desmoid tumor, pregnancy, and the specific location of the <em>APC</em> mutation (3' of codon 1444 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/6,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,28</a>]). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'APC mutations'</a> below.)</p><p>The intraabdominal desmoids that develop in patients with FAP are often unresectable because they diffusely infiltrate the mesentery. Furthermore, recurrences tend to become more frequent and aggressive with each surgical intervention. For these reasons, a multidisciplinary approach that includes systemic therapy is typically required to achieve optimal outcomes for these patients. (See <a href=\"#H958380\" class=\"local\">'Intraabdominal desmoids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desmoid tumors have been associated with high estrogen states. Extraabdominal and abdominal desmoids tend to occur in women during or following pregnancy. The classic presentation is that of an abdominal mass that is separate from the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Trauma related to the pregnancy (including a scar from a prior Cesarean section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]) and exposure to elevated hormone levels may both be contributory, although the evidence linking high estrogen levels and desmoid tumors is largely based on anecdotal and retrospective reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>If a woman had a desmoid arise during a prior pregnancy and the desmoid was resected, the recurrence risk during future pregnancies is low. If woman had an existing desmoid (pregnancy-associated or predating any pregnancy) that was managed with watchful waiting, that desmoid can grow during a subsequent pregnancy, but not always. The risk to the pregnancy is very low, and the course of the pregnancy may be relatively normal.</p><p>The best data on sporadic desmoids developing during or shortly after pregnancy, and the natural history of women with a history of desmoid fibromatosis prior to conception come from a multi-institutional retrospective series of 92 women with both desmoids and pregnancy; 44 (48 percent) had a pregnancy-related desmoid (diagnosed during pregnancy [n = 24] or within six months of delivery [n = 20]), while 48 (52 percent) had a history of desmoid tumor previously diagnosed before conception and either still in situ (n = 29, including previous partial resection) or completely resected (n = 19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Initial treatment was resection in 48 percent, medical therapy (cytotoxic chemotherapy with any regimen of agents, antiestrogens or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone inhibitors, other hormonal therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, and targeted biologic therapy) in 9 percent, and watchful waiting in 43 percent. The following were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy-associated desmoid fibromatosis is associated with good outcomes overall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No obstetric complications were directly attributable to the presence of desmoid fibromatosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 24 women who presented with a desmoid during pregnancy, 12 of the 15 patients initially managed with watchful waiting had progressive tumor growth during or after pregnancy; however, of the 16 patients who were initially managed conservatively (which included one patient treated with medical therapy), only four eventually required resection.

Up to 30 percent of patients with desmoid tumors have a history that involves antecedent trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], particularly, as noted above, surgical intervention in patients with FAP. A similar relationship has been observed in some sporadically occurring desmoid tumors. In one series, an antecedent history of trauma at the tumor site was elicited in 28 percent of 32 primary desmoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The association between antecedent trauma and the development of desmoids is particularly compelling in view of emerging data implicating a molecular connection between wound healing processes and fibroproliferative disorders of mesenchymal tissue. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and molecular pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of desmoid tumors is unknown. However, the identification of clonal chromosomal changes in a significant fraction of cases supports the neoplastic nature of these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In addition, as noted above, emerging evidence implicates dysregulated wound healing in the pathogenesis of these and other fibroblastic lesions. </p><p>Understanding molecular pathogenesis is of considerable interest in this disease given its highly variable clinical course. Lesions can range from stable or spontaneously regressing to slow growing to rapidly progressive with varying propensity to recur after definitive therapy. Identifying the molecular aberrations that predict the clinical course can be very useful from a therapeutic standpoint and is a subject of active investigation.</p><p>The molecular events that lead to desmoid tumor formation are incompletely understood. However, increasing evidence points to involvement of the <em>APC</em> gene and beta-catenin (both components of the Wnt signaling pathway) in the molecular pathogenesis of desmoids both in Gardner syndrome as well as in sporadic desmoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Desmoids in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) arise from <em>APC</em> inactivation and subsequent accumulation of beta-catenin in cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In contrast, <em>APC</em> mutations are uncommon in sporadic desmoids, which usually arise from mutations in the gene for beta-catenin, <em>CTNNB1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and its role in desmoid tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">Wnt/beta-catenin</span> signaling pathway is thought to play a key role in the molecular pathogenesis of desmoid tumors, both those associated with FAP, and sporadic tumors. The basic features of the Wnt signaling pathway are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72022\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72022 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Beta-catenin plays an active role in transcription within mesenchymal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) complex tightly regulates levels of beta-catenin in the cell by phosphorylation, which results in destruction of beta-catenin in the proteasome. Activation of the Wnt pathway initiated by binding of an external ligand causes inhibition of the kinase activity of the APC complex resulting in greater levels of beta-catenin in the cell. This non-phosphorylated beta-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it acts with other proteins to activate the transcription of genes such as <em>CYCD1</em> and <em>MYC</em>, thereby promoting proliferation and enhanced survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Mutations in either the <em>APC</em> gene or the beta-catenin gene (<em>CTNNB1</em>) can result in dysregulation of the levels of beta-catenin in the cell that leads to its accumulation in the nucleus. Whole exome sequencing and genomic analysis identify alterations in <em>CTNNB1</em> and Wnt pathway regulators in nearly all patient samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The importance of the Wnt signaling pathway to the molecular pathogenesis of fibroblastic tumors such as desmoids is suggested by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic <em>APC</em> mutations as well as activating mutations of <em>CTNNB1 </em>(both of which result in accumulation of beta-catenin) have been discovered in the majority of sporadic desmoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-catenin protein levels and tcf transcriptional activity are elevated in fibroblasts during the proliferative phase of wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/46,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49,50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In preclinical models, stabilization of intracellular beta-catenin leads to dysregulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation, motility and invasiveness, and in transgenic mice, induces the development of desmoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p>Activation of Wnt signaling through constitutively active beta-catenin has been shown to increase expression of midkine (also known as neurite growth-promoting factor 2 [NEGF2], a protein encoded by the <em>MDK</em> gene), which may have a role in pathogenesis in desmoid tumors.

MRI characteristics of desmoid tumors are variable and relate to their cellularity and fibrous content. Desmoids may be hypointense or isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images; they are predominantly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, but hypointense bands may be seen that represent dense collections of collagen bundles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Despite being histologically benign, they are locally infiltrative and can cause death through destruction of adjacent vital structures and organs. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of desmoids is increased in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Given the association with FAP, at some institutions, colonoscopy is recommended for all patients with desmoid tumors, particularly intraabdominal. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'FAP and Gardner syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of desmoids can be a clinical challenge, particularly in patients with FAP who tend to develop intraabdominal desmoids at sites of prior surgery. Because of their locally aggressive behavior and tendency to relapse with more aggressive disease, multimodality treatment is often required for these benign lesions and is best delivered within the context of a multidisciplinary team specializing in sarcoma treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraabdominal and abdominal desmoids tend to occur in women during or following pregnancy. If a woman had a desmoid arise during a prior pregnancy and the desmoid was resected, the recurrence risk during future pregnancies is low. If woman had an existing desmoid (pregnancy-associated or predating any pregnancy) that was managed with watchful waiting, that desmoid can grow during a subsequent pregnancy, but not always. The risk to the pregnancy is very low, and the course of the pregnancy may be relatively normal. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of desmoid tumors is prolonged, variable, and unpredictable, and it is not clear that any intervention improves survival. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Extraabdominal and abdominal wall tumors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation is an appropriate option in asymptomatic patients who may be reliably followed. If desmoids remain unchanged or shrink, observation may be continued. If the tumor increases in size or becomes symptomatic, if there is imminent risk to adjacent structures, or if the desmoid creates cosmetic concerns, treatment should be pursued. (See <a href=\"#H958084\" class=\"local\">'Initial observation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest complete surgical excision as the treatment of choice for a potentially resectable extraabdominal (extremity, trunk, breast) or abdominal wall desmoids in a patient who is medically able to tolerate surgery and if resection can be accomplished without major functional or cosmetic deficit (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Controversy remains as a number of patients will fare well without surgical intervention, so a more conservative approach appears rational for relatively static lesions. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary radiation therapy (RT) is an appropriate option for patients who need treatment but are not good surgical candidates, those who decline surgery, and those for whom surgical morbidity would be excessive. An alternative approach is initiation of systemic treatment in these patients, especially if they are young and there are concerns about the potential for late toxicity from RT. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend not pursuing adjuvant RT in patients with microscopically negative surgical margins, regardless of tumor size (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). We suggest not pursuing adjunctive RT following resection of a primary desmoid tumor with microscopically positive margins (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Since fewer than 50 percent of these patients will develop a recurrence, patients who remain progression-free will be spared the long-term sequelae of RT. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For gross residual disease of a primary desmoid, we suggest observation or RT rather than more radical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Due to the very high local control rates with RT, additional surgery is warranted only if there is strong confidence in obtaining clear margins, and functional loss is minimal and acceptable. Systemic therapy is also effective in controlling extremity desmoids in a number of patients, precluding the need for further surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a recurrent desmoid tumor, our preference is observation or surgical resection. However, systemic therapy or RT alone are reasonable alternative treatments in selected patients who are thought to have a higher morbidity from repeat operation and an increased probability of positive margins. For patients who undergo surgery for a recurrent desmoid, we suggest observation or postoperative RT if the margins are positive (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Management of recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraabdominal desmoid, Gardner syndrome</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have large intraabdominal desmoid tumors, particularly in the setting of Gardner syndrome, surgery is still a standard approach for resectable tumors. However, the infiltrative nature of the desmoid in this situation often precludes surgery, and the surgical margins are often positive. Medical therapy in lieu of surgery is a viable option for patients with more difficult tumors such as those involving the mesentery, major vessels, or other critical structures. (See <a href=\"#H958380\" class=\"local\">'Intraabdominal desmoids'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Desmoid tumors: Systemic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery with or without RT is an appropriate option if there is no response to medical therapy. In this situation, consideration should be given to use of intraoperative electron beam therapy as a component of the treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of recurrence of an intraabdominal tumor in patients with Gardner syndrome is challenging because recurrences tend to become more frequent and aggressive with each surgical intervention. Most of these patients are managed with systemic therapy rather than additional local measures. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Management of recurrent disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmoid-tumors-systemic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Desmoid tumors: Systemic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttreatment surveillance</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no standard protocol for follow-up of patients with desmoid tumors. However, we typically follow patients by clinical examination and radiographic studies (where appropriate) every six months for the first three years, every 12 months to year 6, and then biannually.
