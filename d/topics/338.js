However, treatment is associated with both acute and long-term complications for the breast cancer survivor. The number, nature, and costs of severe adverse effects experienced by women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer are relatively unknown, but may be more common than suspected from what has been reported from clinical trials.</p><p>This was illustrated in a series of 12,239 women aged 63 or younger with newly diagnosed breast cancer between 1998 and 2002, 4075 of whom were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-side-effects-of-adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-early-stage-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Women who were treated with chemotherapy were significantly more likely to visit emergency rooms for all causes (61 versus 42 percent) and for serious adverse effects (16 versus 5 percent). For patients receiving chemotherapy, the major reasons prompting hospitalization or an emergency room visit during the year after their breast cancer diagnosis were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever or infection </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutropenia or thrombocytopenia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dehydration or electrolyte disorders </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, emesis, or diarrhea </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constitutional symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malnutrition </p><p/><p>An overview of acute complications of adjuvant chemotherapy is presented here.

Early recognition and subsequent treatment delay or dose reduction may alleviate or prevent the worsening of symptoms in most cases. Symptoms usually improve slowly after discontinuation of treatment (over weeks to months); if severe, recovery may be incomplete. In addition, paclitaxel can cause an acute pain syndrome in the first few days after administration, characterized by a diffuse aching discomfort that predominantly impacts the legs, hips, and back, though some patients may complain of more widespread pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-side-effects-of-adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-early-stage-breast-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Of available agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> was shown to be effective in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.

Hair thinning typically begins after the second or third cycle of treatment, with more substantial loss as treatment continues. Hair loss is typically transient and regrowth typically occurs after cessation of therapy, although reduced density may be observed. For women with breast cancer who are receiving chemotherapy that is expected to result in significant alopecia, and who place a high value on avoidance of chemotherapy-induced alopecia, we suggest the use of a scalp-cooling device. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia and scalp cooling is discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea'</a> below.)</p><p>The major clinical manifestations of vasomotor symptoms are hot flashes, sleep disturbance, headache, and irritability. The use of systemic estrogen replacement is generally prohibited because data from randomized trials suggest that estrogen therapy may be associated with excessive risk. Therefore, we recommend the use of non-estrogen therapies for controlling symptoms before considering estrogen therapy in these women. This is consistent with guidelines from the North American Menopause Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-side-effects-of-adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-early-stage-breast-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

For those who will later initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, it should be noted that SSRIs and SSNRIs have inhibitory activity on CYP2D6, the liver enzyme that is responsible for converting tamoxifen to its active metabolite endoxifen. Although breast outcomes have not been shown to be worsened for those on other SSRIs or SSNRIs while on tamoxifen, we typically choose an agent with minimal inhibitory activity on CYP2D6 if initiating this type of therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>).

In one trial, 422 women were randomly assigned to CBT, exercise, CBT plus exercise, or to a control group (no interventions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-side-effects-of-adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-early-stage-breast-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. CBT consisted of six weekly group sessions that incorporated relaxation techniques. The exercise program was a 12-week individualized, home-based program that required 2.5 to 3 hours of activity per week. Of those who participated, 64 percent were &le;3 years out from completion of chemotherapy and 93 percent were still taking adjuvant endocrine therapy. High levels of noncompliance were reported (58, 64, and 70 percent in the CBT, exercise, and CBT plus exercise groups, respectively). When outcomes were analyzed using data from women who were compliant (n = 219), all three interventions resulted in significantly lower endocrine symptoms compared with controls at 12 weeks and 6 months. In addition, CBT with or without exercise significantly reduced the perceived burden associated with hot flashes or night sweats, which was sustained at six months. </p><p>The data supporting acupuncture for hot flashes in women with breast cancer have mixed results, and a 2013 Cochrane review concluded there was insufficient evidence for acupuncture as a treatment for postmenopausal hot flashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-side-effects-of-adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-early-stage-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nevertheless, given lack of harm, it may be considered in breast cancer patients in whom pharmacologic therapy has been ineffective or for those who prefer to avoid taking medication for their hot flashes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea is a well-recognized side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy. These drugs appear to have a greater effect on follicular development than on oocytes, with variable degrees of subsequent ovarian dysfunction. Some women develop complete follicular depletion and permanent ovarian failure during chemotherapy, while others become temporarily amenorrheic during therapy, with subsequent return of ovarian function, menstrual cycles, and fertility months to years after treatment cessation. </p><p>Amenorrhea is a poor surrogate for ovarian function and should not be considered as proof of menopause. For those with hormone receptor-positive disease, determining whether a patient is menopausal (versus amenorrheic, but not menopausal) after chemotherapy is an important issue, given that menopausal status influences the choice of endocrine therapy. This is discussed elsewhere.
