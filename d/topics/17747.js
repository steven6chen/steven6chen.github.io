Treatment regimens are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50102 \">table 1</a>). In general, antituberculous regimens consists of two phases: an intensive phase (two months), followed by a continuation phase (four to seven months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; most patients receive six months of treatment (intensive phase of two months and continuation phase of four months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Daily therapy is preferred over intermittent therapy to reduce risk of relapse and drug resistance; this is particularly important during the intensive phase of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. During the continuation phase of treatment, daily treatment is preferred over intermittent therapy; if daily therapy is not feasible, thrice-weekly dosing is preferred over twice-weekly dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This approach is supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis (including 56 randomized trials) in which intermittent dosing was associated with worse treatment outcomes (eg, relapse, failure, and acquired drug resistance) than daily dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>First-line drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a>.

The drugs should be administered simultaneously to synchronize peak serum concentrations and optimize killing; if feasible, use of fixed-drug combination tablets are preferred over separate drug formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The drugs should be administered on an empty stomach if tolerated, but dosing with food is acceptable to ameliorate gastrointestinal upset and is preferable to dividing doses or changing to second-line agents.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antituberculous-drugs-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antituberculous drugs: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individual case management with directly observed therapy (DOT) is preferred for all patients to ensure adherence and prevent emergence of drug resistance. DOT involves assigning a trained nurse or other health worker to provide the antituberculous medication directly to the patient and observe as the patient swallows the medication. This process ensures the appropriate medication is taken as prescribed and provides an opportunity to assess medication side effects at each dose and to follow clinical response closely. Evidence supporting DOT is summarized separately.
