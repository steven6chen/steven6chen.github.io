In some cases, hirsutism is mild and requires only reassurance and perhaps cosmetic therapy, while in others, it causes significant distress and requires more extensive intervention.</p><p>The treatment of hirsutism will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, causes, and evaluation of hirsutism are discussed separately. Direct methods of hair removal are reviewed briefly here and in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and causes of hirsutism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=removal-of-unwanted-hair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Removal of unwanted hair&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445128649\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hirsutism is a clinical diagnosis defined by the presence of excess terminal hair growth (dark, coarse hairs) in androgen-dependent areas (eg, upper lip, chin, midsternum, upper abdomen, back, and buttocks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Hair growth can be graded as either normal or excessive based upon the Ferriman-Gallwey score. There are several conditions characterized by generalized or &quot;excess&quot; hair growth that do <strong>not</strong> represent hirsutism and do not require biochemical evaluation with serum androgens, including hypertrichosis and &quot;unwanted hair&quot; (any hair growth [usually light, unpigmented facial hair] that the patient finds bothersome). This type of hair is not a sign of androgen excess. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H178691563\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Other types of excess hair'</a>.)</p><p>Hirsutism is an important clinical problem that affects approximately 5 to 10 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is important to evaluate and treat because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is associated with significant emotional distress and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H147159572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Emotional distress/depression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is usually an indication of an underlying endocrine disorder (most commonly polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65205 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/1,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the management of hirsute women is to review their diagnosis (most commonly polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]), their goals and expectations, and the degree of distress caused by the hirsutism. We then discuss the available pharmacologic options and methods of direct hair removal (photoepilation and electrolysis). For the majority of women with hirsutism, we suggest starting with pharmacologic therapy. If laser or electrolysis is added later, hair regrowth is minimized by the pharmacologic androgen suppression. However, for women with mild hirsutism and no evidence of an endocrine disorder, we suggest starting with either pharmacologic therapy or direct hair removal methods.</p><p>When reviewing treatment options for women with hirsutism, a number of issues should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To what degree is the patient bothered or distressed by her hirsutism? Treatment decisions should be based in part upon the degree to which the excess hair bothers the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the patient's baseline Ferriman-Gallwey score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66629 \">figure 1</a>)? Mild and severe hirsutism are considered to be scores of &ge;8 to 15 and &gt;15, respectively (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H124279391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Ferriman-Gallwey score'</a>). Although we suggest obtaining a Ferriman-Gallwey score in all women who present with hirsutism, the method has a number of limitations, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Many clinicians are unfamiliar with calculating Ferriman-Gallwey scores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Ferriman-Gallwey score, which is based upon white women, is unreliable in women of other ethnic backgrounds as there is significant <span class=\"nowrap\">ethnic/racial</span> variability in expression of hair growth. A Ferriman-Gallwey score &gt;8 is considered abnormal for black or white women; for Mediterranean, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern women, a Ferriman-Gallwey score &ge;9 to 10 is considered abnormal and for Asian women, &ge;2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H124279391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Ferriman-Gallwey score'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women's self-ratings of hirsutism using the Ferriman-Gallwey score are higher than their clinician's rating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although hirsutism is defined as a score &gt;8, the majority of women with a score &gt;3 consider themselves to be hirsute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Many women with low scores seek treatment because they are as distressed by their hair growth as women with high scores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most women use cosmetic measures prior to their initial consultation, making it difficult to obtain an accurate score. Cosmetic measures include physical methods of removing hair or making it less visible (shaving, plucking, waxing, bleaching). These methods can be effective, and their use is reasonable either alone or as a supplement to drug therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=removal-of-unwanted-hair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Removal of unwanted hair&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the patient's goals and expectations? Reasonable expectations should be fostered; women should be aware that drug therapy is unlikely to completely eliminate hair growth, but that hair may become less coarse, grow more slowly, and require less frequent use of cosmetic methods (shaving, plucking, waxing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have PCOS? It is estimated that up to 70 to 80 percent of women with hirsutism have PCOS. These women have additional abnormalities that require attention, including oligoovulation, obesity, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. For overweight and obese women, we recommend weight loss as the initial step, a strategy that, if successful, results in improved insulin sensitivity, a decrease in serum androgens, and, in some cases, a return of ovulatory cycles (see <a href=\"#H3707502537\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> below). The management of PCOS is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have hyperandrogenemia? If so, we suggest pharmacologic therapy as the first step. Although direct methods of hair removal may be effective in the short term, women with underlying hyperandrogenemia are likely to experience hair regrowth because of the continued stimulation of hair follicles by endogenous androgens. This can be prevented by suppressing endogenous androgens with pharmacologic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1370570348\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug therapy or hair removal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that most women with hirsutism start with pharmacologic therapy, and we consider oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives to be the first-line drug for women who do not want to become pregnant; an antiandrogen is then added if the clinical response is suboptimal after six months of therapy. Insulin-lowering agents are not an effective therapy for hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>].</p><p>Oral contraceptives (OCs) can be used as monotherapy, but antiandrogens are often added to get a better cosmetic response. Although antiandrogens are an effective therapy for hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], we suggest against using them as monotherapy because of the potential risk that a developing male fetus could be undervirilized.</p><p>For all drug therapies for hirsutism, we suggest a trial of at least six months before making any changes in dose, adding a medication, or switching to a new medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Direct hair removal methods are another option for initial therapy, but as noted above, we suggest that most women with hirsutism start with pharmacologic therapy. Although direct methods of hair removal may be effective in the short term, women with underlying hyperandrogenemia are likely to experience hair regrowth because of the continued stimulation of hair follicles by endogenous androgens. This can be prevented by suppressing endogenous androgens with pharmacologic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3291691267\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted, we suggest pharmacologic therapy for most women with hirsutism. Oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives are our first-line drug for women who do not want to become pregnant; an antiandrogen can then be added if the clinical response is suboptimal after six months of therapy. Women should be aware that OCs and antiandrogens do not have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the indication of hirsutism. Therefore, these therapies represent &quot;off-label&quot; use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4062878940\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the majority of women with hirsutism who choose pharmacologic therapy, we suggest estrogen-progestin contraceptives as initial therapy. Efficacy data come primarily from OC studies, but transdermal and vaginal estrogen-progestin contraceptive preparations are also considered to be effective. These preparations also provide additional nonhirsutism benefits such as contraception and cycle management.</p><p>It is estimated that 60 to 100 percent of hyperandrogenic women experience a significant reduction in hair growth with OC therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, clinical trial data on the impact of OCs on hirsutism are surprisingly limited. The best evidence comes from a pooled analysis of two trials in 34 women comparing OCs with either placebo or no therapy; OC therapy was associated with a greater reduction in Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scores (mean difference in score reduction 8.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/10,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,18</a>].</p><p>For women with PCOS, estrogen-progestin contraceptives provide the additional benefit of preventing the development of endometrial hyperplasia. The treatment of PCOS and the use of OCs for hirsutism are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>OC therapy is usually begun with a formulation that contains anywhere from 20 to 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. The lower 20 mcg dose should be used for women with any risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE; smoking, obesity, age &gt;39 years). There had been concerns that the OCs with lower doses of ethinyl estradiol (20 mcg) would be less effective for ovarian androgen suppression. However, in a meta-analysis of 42 studies, suppression of serum total and free testosterone concentrations was similar with 20 mcg versus 30 to 35 mcg dose pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The transdermal contraceptive patch and vaginal ring suppress serum androgens to a similar degree, but their impact on hirsutism has not been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H523387426\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Lower doses'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3650681133\"><span class=\"h4\">Mechanisms of action in hyperandrogenism/hirsutism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OC therapy reduces hyperandrogenism by the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inhibition of gonadotropin secretion </strong>&ndash; Inhibition of ovarian androgen production through suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. OC therapy decreases LH and to a lesser extent follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion in hyperandrogenic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. In studies of gonadotropin secretion in women with PCOS, serum FSH concentrations fell more rapidly than did serum LH concentrations, but the fall in serum LH was greater (70 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The result was decreased ovarian secretion of testosterone and other androgens by the ovaries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased SHBG </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Stimulation of the hepatic production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing androgen binding in serum and reducing serum free androgen concentrations. In the circulation, testosterone (and estradiol) are bound with high affinity to SHBG and, with lesser affinity but greater extent, to albumin. In women, only approximately 1.0 to 1.5 percent of the testosterone in serum is in the physiologically active free form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Androgens and insulin both decrease the hepatic production of SHBG. Since both are often increased in hyperandrogenic women, these women have lower serum SHBG concentrations than normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Estrogen (and OCs) causes a dose-dependent increase in serum SHBG concentrations over three to four weeks in hyperandrogenic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/24,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29,30</a>]. This increase is smaller in women treated with an OC containing a progestin that has significant androgenic properties (eg, norgestrel) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As serum SHBG concentrations increase, serum free testosterone concentration decreases. This may be due to the fact that estrogen inhibits LH secretion, preventing a compensatory response to the fall in serum free testosterone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When hormonally evaluating women who have been on an OC, it is best to discontinue the medications for at least 8 if not 12 weeks as it takes at least this length of time for measured androgens and SHBG levels to return to basal values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduction in serum total and free testosterone concentrations </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>As a result of both inhibition of LH secretion and increase in SHBG production, serum free testosterone concentrations decrease by approximately 50 percent in hyperandrogenic women treated with an OC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61395\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61395 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/21-23,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23,33,34</a>]. Serum total testosterone concentrations also fall but not as much as free testosterone, because of the increase in serum SHBG concentrations. These changes may occur over several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>] but can be slower, especially in women with marked insulin resistance in whom both ovarian androgen and hepatic SHBG production are presumably more dependent on insulin than LH or estrogen. The changes are independent of ovarian histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary mechanisms </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>OCs may also ameliorate hyperandrogenism by decreasing adrenal androgen secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>], inhibiting the peripheral conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and inhibiting the binding of DHT to androgen receptors. However, the evidence that OCs have any of these actions is not strong, and it is unlikely that these mechanisms contribute importantly to their benefit in hyperandrogenic women.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1630271239\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of pill</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically choose an OC that contains a progestin with low androgenicity (or a progestin that has antiandrogenic properties such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a> [CPA]). Some OCs contain the progestin, drospirenone, which is structurally related to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>. Drospirenone is a very weak antiandrogen at the dose employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Data comparing OCs containing drospirenone with OCs containing other progestins are limited and do not suggest a clinical advantage of drospirenone-OCs for hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. In addition, there have been concerns about a possible excess risk of VTE when compared with other OCs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H342468929\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Type of progestin'</a>.)</p><p>In theory, OCs containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>, the most androgenic progestin, should be avoided because of concerns that they would worsen hirsutism. However, limited clinical trial data suggest that these preparations have similar benefit for hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/10,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,43</a>]. Levonorgestrel may also have an adverse effect on metabolic markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], but there are no data to suggest these are associated with adverse clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. OCs containing some of the third-generation progestins (desogestrel, gestodene) have also been associated with a higher risk of VTE.

The patient's assessment of her response to therapy is the most important outcome. At each follow-up visit, the patient should be asked whether she has noted any decreased need for cosmetic methods (shaving, plucking, waxing) to manage her hirsutism.</p><p>In addition, we do try to obtain a Ferriman-Gallwey score at baseline and at each follow-up visit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66629 \">figure 1</a>). However, as noted, the score is unreliable in women who routinely use cosmetic hair removal methods.

However, for women with mild hirsutism and no evidence of an endocrine disorder, we suggest starting with either pharmacologic therapy <strong>or</strong> direct hair removal methods (electrolysis or photoepilation [laser and intense pulsed light]) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with hyperandrogenism undergoing direct hair removal methods, we suggest that pharmacologic therapy be added or continued to minimize hair regrowth (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4194241682\" class=\"local\">'Direct hair removal methods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For any pharmacologic therapy, we suggest a minimum of six months before making changes in dose or type of medication or adding a medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2084095680\" class=\"local\">'Duration of drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the majority of women with hirsutism who choose pharmacologic therapy, we suggest oral contraceptives (OCs) as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4062878940\" class=\"local\">'Oral contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although we do not suggest one particular OC over another, it is reasonable to avoid preparations with the most androgenic progestin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>, which has less desirable metabolic effects. (See <a href=\"#H4062878940\" class=\"local\">'Oral contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a suboptimal cosmetic result after six months of OC monotherapy, we suggest adding an antiandrogen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2084095680\" class=\"local\">'Duration of drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In occasional women with severe hirsutism causing emotional distress, we suggest starting with combination therapy (an OC <strong>and</strong> an antiandrogen). (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) However, we suggest against combination therapy as a standard approach. (See <a href=\"#H1870485704\" class=\"local\">'Severe symptoms causing distress'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest against using antiandrogens as monotherapy (unless reliable contraception is used) because of the potential risk that a developing male fetus could be undervirilized. (See <a href=\"#H2273583496\" class=\"local\">'Antiandrogen therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend against the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flutamide</a> for hirsutism because of its potential hepatotoxicity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H979048601\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antiandrogen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using insulin-lowering drugs for hirsutism (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3126952879\" class=\"local\">'Treatments not recommended'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest OCs as first-line therapy for women with nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency (nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia [NCCAH]) and hirsutism (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hirsutism/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rosenfield RL.
