The cause of ITP remains unknown in most cases, but it can be triggered by a preceding viral infection. ITP was previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The current term <strong>I</strong>mmune <strong>T</strong>hrombocyto<strong>P</strong>enia preserves the widely-recognized acronym &quot;ITP&quot; and acknowledges the immune-mediated mechanism of the disorder, while allowing that patients may have little or no signs of purpura or bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>ITP in children often resolves spontaneously within three months. Up to 20 percent of affected children will go on to have chronic ITP, which is defined as thrombocytopenia for more than 12 months since presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Risk factors for developing chronic ITP include older age, less severe thrombocytopenia at the initial diagnosis, insidious onset of symptoms, and lack of preceding infection or vaccination prior to development of ITP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management#H55214501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Disease course'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55529287\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the initial presentation of a child with symptoms suggestive of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a basic evaluation should be performed to exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia, including a focused history and physical examination, and laboratory testing consisting of a complete blood count (CBC) with a reticulocyte count, differential white blood cell count and red blood cell indices, and direct antiglobulin test (DAT, also known as a direct Coombs test) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89206 \">table 1</a>). Children with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, systemic symptoms, or any abnormalities in the CBC or peripheral blood smear, should promptly undergo further investigation to exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia. This initial diagnostic evaluation is discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Children who were initially diagnosed with ITP but go on to develop chronic ITP also should undergo additional evaluation to exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia, such as chronic infections (including HIV, hepatitis C, and cytomegalovirus [CMV]), bone marrow failure, collagen vascular disorders, and especially immunodeficiency disorders (such as common variable immunodeficiency, [CVID]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61163\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61163 \">table 2</a>). This additional workup is also important for children who have not had an unequivocal response to ITP-specific treatments, such as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and anti-D immune globulin (anti-D, also known as anti-Rho immune globulin), even if the response is transient.</p><p>The evaluation for a child with chronic ITP (ie, at one to one and a half years from diagnosis) typically includes antibody testing and polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for associated viruses, bone marrow examination including a biopsy and cytogenetics including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunoglobulin levels, thyroid testing, and studies for collagen vascular disorders (eg, antinuclear antibody test). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55528382\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In chronic ITP, platelet counts may range between 1000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span>. Consequently, some patients require no treatment although they may be troubled by intermittent thrombocytopenia to clinically significant levels, often triggered by an infection. The threshold for pharmacologic treatment depends on multiple factors, including ongoing bleeding, risk factors for bleeding (eg, sports or an active lifestyle), anxiety, fatigue, access to medical care, concomitant conditions and medications. These decisions should be individualized and made in collaboration with the patient and family. Children with chronic ITP should be managed by a pediatric hematologist, if possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55530194\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive care for children with chronic ITP focuses on minimizing the individual's risk for bleeding, and alleviating other factors that may reduce quality of life, such as fatigue and anxiety about bleeding risks. The components of supportive care are similar to those for children with newly diagnosed or persistent ITP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restrict physical activities with risk of trauma. The type of activity that is restricted has not been standardized, and decisions should be made in collaboration with the patient and family. Alternatively, measures to increase the platelet count can be instituted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid medications with anti-platelet activity, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor menstrual bleeding, and treat with hormonal therapy if needed (See <a href=\"#H55528403\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide education to the child and caregivers about the risks and complications of ITP and when to seek care. (See <a href=\"#H82713908\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Details of these supportive interventions are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management&quot;, section on 'General measures'</a>.)</p><p>Information for patients and families is provided below (see <a href=\"#H82713908\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below).

For example, if a previously asymptomatic patient develops new bleeding symptoms, weekly monitoring with a complete blood count (CBC) is appropriate until the symptoms and platelet count stabilize. If a patient has minimal symptoms and the platelet count is stable at a moderate level (eg, 50,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL),</span> monitoring can be done as infrequently as every three months. In our practice, we stop monitoring after the platelet count has returned to normal and has remained stable for two to six months.</p><p>Patients with chronic ITP also should be evaluated at least annually for thyroid disease because of the high association between ITP and autoimmune thyroid disease. Testing for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) also should be performed annually. In some patients with chronic severe ITP and persistent significant hemorrhagic symptoms that require frequent pharmacologic interventions, splenectomy may be appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H55528396\" class=\"local\">'Splenectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55528389\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with chronic ITP, pharmacologic therapy may be indicated for patients with ongoing or recurrent bleeding risks, using a continuous or intermittent treatment regimen. In addition, some patients may require acute intervention, eg, when an acute increase in platelet count is required for surgery or other procedure, or in anticipation of an activity that increases risk for a bleeding complication (such as travel or rock climbing). Very rarely, platelet transfusion(s) or combination therapy may be administered for life-threatening bleeding or in the setting of major trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management#H1091048630\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Life-threatening bleeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55530163\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first-line pharmacologic options for acute intervention are similar to those used in the initial management of patients with newly-diagnosed ITP, and include intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), or anti-D immune globulin (anti-D), or glucocorticoids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89045 \">table 3</a>). The dosing and administration of IVIG and IV anti-D is identical to that which may be used at diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management#H8247630\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Initial management&quot;, section on 'First-line therapies'</a>.)</p><p>Prolonged daily use of glucocorticoids should be avoided because of adverse effects, especially on growth in children.

For children who require prolonged use of glucocorticoids, alternate-day dosing is occasionally effective and somewhat reduces side effects, although this approach is becoming less common because of the availability of new alternative treatments for ITP, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a> and thrombopoietic agents. Other agents that are sometimes used for patients who require chronic immunosuppression include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azathioprine</a> or 6-mercaptopurine.

Several single-arm but no randomized studies support its use in pediatric patients with persistent or chronic disease. It is a chimeric <span class=\"nowrap\">murine/human</span> anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets autoantibody-producing B lymphocytes but not plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. It is typically dosed at 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m2</span> weekly for four weeks, although optimal dosing in pediatric patients is not defined. We suggest glucocorticoid administration with the first infusion to minimize acute reactions, especially fever and chills.</p><p>Open-label studies in children with chronic ITP suggest an initial response rate around 40 to 50 percent, falling to approximately 25 percent over follow-up of 24 months or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Observational studies in adults, one of which also included 23 children, suggest that combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a> plus high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> may improve response rates compared with monotherapy with either drug alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, rituximab treatment achieves a durable remission in approximately 25 percent of patients and a six- to twelve-month-long platelet increase in another 25 percent. While its side effects can be serious, they fortunately are very rare. Data on the use of rituximab in adults with ITP are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies#H16539965\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Second-line and subsequent therapies&quot;, section on 'Rituximab'</a>.)</p><p>Mild, transient side effects may occur with the first infusion, including urticarial rash, headache, fever, scratchy throat, and chills. Serum sickness occurs in 5 to 10 percent of children with ITP treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a>, a rate that is higher than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has been reported as a very rare but very serious complication of rituximab therapy, including only one case in a patient with ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pretreatment testing includes screening for hepatitis B carrier state and hypogammaglobulinemia. Hepatitis B carriers may see activation with rituximab treatment. Hypogammaglobulinemia, while infrequent with rituximab alone, may occur if rituximab is administered concomitantly with glucocorticoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55529121\"><span class=\"h4\">Thrombopoietin receptor agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eltrombopag-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">eltrombopag</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romiplostim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romiplostim</a>) are emerging as effective agents for treatment of children with persistent and chronic ITP. These drugs stimulate thrombopoiesis via the thrombopoietin receptor and are second- and third-line treatment options for adult patients with chronic severe ITP without persistent response to conventional therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Second-line and subsequent therapies&quot;, section on 'Thrombopoietin receptor agonists'</a>.)</p><p>The use of these agents in children is primarily limited by cost considerations of because in general they only support an increased platelet count as long as they are continued and they do not typically induce a remission. In addition, their long-term side effects in children, while seeming limited, are not fully known. These agents may increase risks for thrombosis in patients with other risk factors for thrombosis and have been reported to induce leukemia in patients with underlying myelodysplastic syndromes, but these issues are more common in adults and rarely affect children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H705919405\"><span class=\"h5\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, due to the limitations of the available pediatric data and cost considerations, we generally reserve TPO receptor agonists for patients who have ITP lasting &ge;6 months in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient fails treatment with splenectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is ineligible for (because of age, high infection risk, high surgical risk, or other considerations) or refuses treatment with splenectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient requires a high platelet count for surgery or another activity with high risk of bleeding and this cannot be readily achieved with other therapies (eg, steroids, IVIG)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1323081361\"><span class=\"h5\">Specific agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available TPO receptor agonists include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eltrombopag-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">eltrombopag</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romiplostim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romiplostim</a>.

The efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in children has been investigated in two industry-sponsored randomized controlled trials, PETIT and PETIT2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In the larger PETIT2 trial, which included 92 children with chronic ITP (duration &gt;12 months), 40 percent (25 of 63) of patients randomized to eltrombopag achieved a response (defined as platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;50,000/microL</span> for 6 of the 8 weeks) during the double-blind period of the trial compared with 3 percent (1 of 29) in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. During the 24-week open-label treatment period that followed the randomized trial, 81 percent (70 of 87) of patients achieved at least one platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL</span>. During the double-blind period of the trial, bleeding events occurred less frequently in patients who received eltrombopag than those who received placebo (37 versus 55 percent). Adverse events associated with eltrombopag were mild and included transaminitis (3 percent of children had to discontinue eltrombopag because of transaminitis) and minor respiratory symptoms. Liver function tests should be monitored at least monthly during treatment. Other serious adverse events were infrequent and did not differ between groups. Two patients in the PETIT2 trial who received eltrombopag and corticosteroids developed cataracts, highlighting that routine ophthalmologic surveillance may be warranted. Some practices perform a pretreatment eye examination and yearly examination while on treatment.

In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial involving 62 children with chronic ITP (duration &gt;6 months), durable platelet response (defined weekly platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;50,000/microL</span> without rescue drug use in six of the final eight weeks of the six-month trial) was seen in 52 percent (22 of 42 patients) in the romiplostim group compared with 10 percent (2 of 20 patients) in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Bleeding events, concomitant medication use, and use of rescue treatments were all reduced by romiplostim. Treatment-related serious adverse events (which included headache and thrombocytosis) occurred in one patient. Limited evidence on long-term use of romiplostim in children suggests that platelet counts can be maintained for over four years with good tolerability and without major toxicity similar to long-term data reported in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>In the clinical trials described above, long-term response was generally consistent with both agents.

The use of these agents in childhood ITP is based on anecdotal clinical experience and small clinical trials in adults. None of these agents have been demonstrated to have unequivocal curative effects and all have some toxicity (eg, hepatotoxicity, increased risk of infection). The rate of efficacy of these agents is generally low. Nonetheless these agents may have some utility in certain refractory cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55528396\"><span class=\"h2\">Splenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenectomy is an appropriate option for the small percentage of patients with chronic ITP who have persistent clinically significant, generally severe thrombocytopenia accompanied by hemorrhagic symptoms, who require repeated or continuous pharmacologic interventions. Although splenectomy is effective in most patients, it is also associated with substantial risks especially overwhelming sepsis. The risk of sepsis is particularly high in very young patients (ie, &lt;4 or 5 years of age), in whom splenectomy should be avoided whenever possible.</p><p>Splenectomy is effective in improving the platelet count and reducing the associated risk of bleeding in 60 to 80 percent of children with chronic ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. No universally accepted standards for the timing of splenectomy in chronic ITP exist, but the American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines recommend waiting until at least 12 months after the initial ITP diagnosis, if at all possible, and avoiding splenectomy for children &lt;5 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Furthermore, there is general consensus that appropriate candidates for splenectomy are those with very low platelet count, bleeding complications, and lack of adequate response with standard medications. When possible, surgery should be performed using a laparoscopic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-second-line-and-subsequent-therapies#H16547568\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Second-line and subsequent therapies&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to planned splenectomy, the diagnosis of ITP should be critically reviewed to exclude causes of thrombocytopenia other than ITP, especially those related to immune deficiency, ongoing viral infection, systemic autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, [SLE]), or an inherited form of thrombocytopenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61163\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61163 \">table 2</a>). This includes a comprehensive serologic evaluation as previously described. (See <a href=\"#H55529287\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, in our practice, we routinely perform a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy prior to planned splenectomy unless there is a documented recent and robust response to IVIG or another ITP therapy demonstrating that the bone marrow is intact. This practice differs from in the ASH guidelines, which state that splenectomy is not necessarily an indication for bone marrow biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Splenectomy is associated with important risks, which must be weighed against the beneficial effects of splenectomy on platelet count and hemostasis. The most critical is the small but lifelong risk of overwhelming infection, which occurs in approximately 1 to 2 percent of splenectomized patients, usually with encapsulated organisms such as <em>Pneumococcus</em>, <em>Haemophilus</em>, and <em>Neisseria</em>. Because infection risks are higher in very young asplenic individuals, it is important to use temporizing therapies and avoid splenectomy whenever possible for patients younger than four to five years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Pre-splenectomy immunizations are necessary and subsequent penicillin prophylaxis may be appropriate for all age groups. These issues are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other long-term risks associated with splenectomy have not been fully explored, but concerns have been raised about increased risks for thrombosis, particularly stroke. In a population-based study, splenectomized patients (mostly adults) had a 1.5-fold increased risk of stroke compared with non-splenectomized ITP controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, pulmonary hypertension has been observed in splenectomized patients with hereditary spherocytosis but not confirmed in splenectomized ITP patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-spherocytosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary spherocytosis&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Platelet counts should be monitored for an indefinite period following splenectomy until the count is clearly stabilized. Once stabilized, we typically monitor the platelet count at least yearly depending upon whether the count remains low or has returned to normal. Pneumococcal titers should be measured at the same time, to determine if additional vaccination is warranted, though consensus is lacking as to the optimal frequency of revaccination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H1193507\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Revaccination in children and adults'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with ongoing severe ITP after splenectomy and standard pharmacologic therapies are considered to have chronic refractory ITP. Occasionally, an accessory spleen causes late recurrence of ITP following splenectomy, especially if the initial splenectomy resulted in remission for at least one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In such cases, the possibility of an accessory spleen should be investigated with abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography. In one series, 10 percent of adult patients with chronic refractory ITP were found to have an accessory spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This possibility is further suggested if Howell-Jolly bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60588 \">picture 1</a>) are absent on the peripheral smear following splenectomy. (See <a href=\"#H55530026\" class=\"local\">'Chronic refractory ITP'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55528403\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal therapy may be valuable to manage patients with heavy menses. We generally use progesterone-based treatment (eg, 5 to 10 mg daily of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [Provera]) or a low-estrogen formulation, rather than standard estrogen-based contraceptive. This is because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> has positive effects on platelet counts in ITP, and estrogen is thought to promulgate autoimmunity. Adolescent women who have heavy menses or recurrent epistaxis also should be evaluated for iron deficiency, and iron replacement should be provided.</p><p>Other therapies that may prove valuable in patients with chronic ITP include the antifibrinolytic agents, epsilon <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminocaproic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aminocaproic acid</a> (Amicar) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tranexamic acid</a>. These agents are especially effective for mouth and nose bleeding, and they may be used instead of (or in addition to) measures to raise the platelet count prior to dental work. These agents may also provide some benefit in cases of severe bleeding that do not respond clinically to platelet transfusions. Recombinant factor VIIa can also be useful in this setting. Antifibrinolytics should be avoided in patients who have hypercoagulability (thrombophilia) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a family history of thrombotic events. In addition, antifibrinolytics should be avoided in patients &lt;1 to 2 years of age since there are reports of hyponatremia leading to seizures with their use in young infants.

In a large registry study, more than one quarter of those who still had ITP 12 months from diagnosis underwent complete remission by 24 months from diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

After five years of chronic ITP, 12 percent of subjects had platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL,</span> while 52 percent had recovered completely.</p><p>Children &lt;10 years old are more likely to enter remission than older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Children &gt;10 years old, especially adolescent females, have a disease course more like that seen in adults with ITP. Neither of these tendencies is enough to substantially alter management. The role that hormonal and other physiologic changes of puberty play in this process is not well understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H1370199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Disease course'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55529969\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of serious bleeding in chronic ITP is modest, depending upon the platelet count. A very low count is permissive, but not sufficient, for bleeding. In the previously described Nordic registry study, &lt;10 percent of patients with chronic ITP experienced a serious bleeding episode in five years of follow-up, and in each case the bleeding episode was in the context of a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is &lt;1 percent, but may be slightly higher among patients with chronic ITP as compared with those with newly diagnosed ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Patients with very low platelet counts (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10,000/microL)</span> are at risk for serious bleeding even if they have not had previous bleeding. Most cases of ICH occur at these very low counts. However, there is individual variation in bleeding severity, which is not well understood and is independent of the platelet count. This may be explained by differences in endothelial and platelet function that are difficult to capture with standard tests.
