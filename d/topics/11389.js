These problems are important to recognize because they often respond to treatment, preventing pain and disability and improving quality of life. Specific arthropathies of the hand and shoulder are discussed in this review. The relationships of diabetes with osteoarthritis and gout have become more clear, and the data that bear on the associations are also briefly mentioned. Osteoarthritis and neck and shoulder disorders have a significant impact on the quality of life in people with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Estimates of the prevalence of musculoskeletal problems in patients with diabetes mellitus vary depending upon the definitions used for the problems and the study population with diabetes, which can range from diabetics on an insurance database to primary care cohorts and patients with severe diabetes in a specialized referral setting.</p><p>There are several other musculoskeletal complications of diabetes mellitus which are discussed separately. These include limited joint mobility, neuropathic arthropathy (eg, Charcot joint), bone disease, and diabetic muscle infarction.

One study, for example, evaluated 100 diabetic patients selected randomly in an outpatient clinic. Hand abnormalities were observed in 50 patients, and more than one abnormality was found in 26 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, 25 of the 50 patients with hand syndromes were disabled to such an extent that surgery was recommended. Carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's contracture, flexor tenosynovitis, and limited joint mobility were each present in approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In a study of 200 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and 100 controls, the prevalence of hand or shoulder disorders was higher in the diabetic patients than in controls and correlated with the duration, but not the type, of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Carpal tunnel syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a painful disorder caused by compression of the median nerve between the carpal ligament and other structures within the carpal tunnel. It has been reported in up to 20 percent of diabetic patients, but the incidence rises to 75 percent in those with limited joint mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Furthermore, diabetes has been reported in 6 to 17 percent of all cases of CTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], and CTS may be more common in those with pre-diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found a similar risk of CTS in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (pooled odds ratio, adjusted for confounders, of 1.69, 95% CI 1.45-1.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two studies comparing two groups of diabetic and nondiabetic patients undergoing carpal tunnel release showed clinical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and neurophysiological [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] outcomes to be similar in both groups, although the diabetic patients were more likely to report the persistence of cold intolerance. Clinical benefit was maintained five years after surgery and comparable to that in nondiabetics, and cold intolerance in the patients with diabetes improved over that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Median nerve entrapment in diabetes is presumably due to the connective tissue changes which also lead to limited joint mobility. Carpal tunnel syndrome is associated with the duration of diabetes but not with metabolic control, nephropathy, or retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Many associations have been reported, including racial and genetic factors, chronic liver disease, and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Depending upon the criteria used for diagnosis, Dupuytren's contractures have been reported in 16 to 42 percent of diabetic outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. The prevalence increases with age and the duration of diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupuytrens-contracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dupuytren's contracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexor tenosynovitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tenosynovitis of the flexor tendon of the finger (trigger finger) in diabetes is characterized by palpable nodule formation and thickening localized to the flexor tendon or sheath and by locking phenomena. The ring finger, middle finger, and thumb are most often affected, and the condition is sometimes bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger finger (stenosing flexor tenosynovitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Flexor tenosynovitis has been reported in 5 percent of a series of 250 patients with type 1 diabetes aged 3 to 38 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and in 20 percent of 100 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes aged 19 to 62 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of trigger finger is related to the duration of diabetes but not to metabolic control. Collagen abnormalities induced by diabetes mellitus are thought to be responsible. One study of over 250,000 diabetic patients in a large insurance database showed a prevalence of stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) of only 1.5 percent, compared with a prevalence in nondiabetics of 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this study, tenosynovitis appeared more common in women. Diabetics are more likely than nondiabetics to have multiple digit involvement with stenosing flexor tenosynovitis, although it can also occur in nondiabetics; diabetic limited joint mobility has also been associated with multiple digit involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Local glucocorticoid injection may be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but some patients require repeated surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetic sclerodactyly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sclerodactyly is characterized by thickening and waxiness of the skin most marked on the dorsa of the fingers. It is associated with limited joint mobility, although it can occur without joint involvement. The skin changes resemble those in scleroderma. However, the Raynaud phenomena, ulceration, calcinosis, and tapering are absent, and autoantibodies are negative (pseudoscleroderma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The frequency of skin changes correlates with the duration of diabetes, although skin changes have been described in children with diabetes of recent onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other than improving glycemic control, which is of theoretical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], no treatment exists for this condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Reflex sympathetic dystrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (also known as complex regional pain syndrome I) is characterized by severe pain or burning sensation, most commonly in the hand or foot, with associated swelling, trophic skin changes, and signs or symptoms of vasomotor instability. When the hand is affected, there may be associated pain or limitation of the ipsilateral shoulder (shoulder-hand syndrome).</p><p>Reflex sympathetic dystrophy may be bilateral, and bone films characteristically show patchy osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It is said to be more common in diabetes, but this association is not well-documented. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SHOULDER PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two main types of shoulder problems, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) and calcific periarthritis (calcific tendinitis), have been described in diabetic patients. The prevalence of adhesive capsulitis in patients with diabetes depends upon the criteria used for diagnosis and upon the population studied. It can vary substantially between studies, and many studies do not use radiographs to exclude osteoarthritis.</p><p>Adhesive capsulitis has been reported in 19 to 29 percent of diabetics compared with approximately 5 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Increased age, longer duration of diabetes, the presence of limited joint mobility, and Dupuytren's contractures were also associated with an increased risk of painful capsulitis; retinopathy was also more frequent in those with capsulitis, while neuropathy and heavy proteinuria were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A subsequent study of 865 diabetic patients found a prevalence of shoulder pain of 26 percent, compared with 5 percent of general medical patients, but only 4 percent of the diabetics fulfilled the strict criteria for adhesive capsulitis used, compared with 0.5 percent of medical patients. Only duration of diabetes was associated with adhesive capsulitis in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In contrast, shoulder capsulitis was found in 25 percent of a series of 96 diabetics and was associated with retinopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuropathy. In this series, 75 percent of diabetics had locomotor problems, most often with the upper limb, and shoulder and hand problems showed a significant association with poorer glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-adhesive-capsulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Conversely, in a series of 60 patients with capsulitis, overt or latent diabetes was found in 17 (28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Soft tissue calcification with shoulder periarthritis also appears to occur three times more frequently in diabetics than in controls, although only one-third are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A longitudinal population-based study involving 78,827 diabetics and 236,481 age- and sex-matched controls found that 1.2 percent of diabetics developed adhesive capsulitis in a three-year period compared with 0.95 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Adhesive capsulitis is a common cause of shoulder pain in diabetics. One report, for example, evaluated 60 diabetic patients with shoulder pain; 58 percent had adhesive capsulitis, while 28 percent had tendinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A link between adhesive capsulitis and limited joint mobility has also been postulated, but the data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,29</a>]. An association has been suggested in one report of patients with relatively painless loss of movement. Limited joint mobility can affect the shoulder joint, and some of these subjects may not have had a true capsulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Although diabetic patients benefit from arthroscopic release for adhesive capsulitis, results of surgery may not be as good as those seen in nondiabetics, with only 71 percent of diabetics recovering full range of shoulder movement compared with 90 percent of nondiabetics in one prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Postoperative adhesive capsulitis also appears to be more common in diabetics. In a prospective study of 505 patients undergoing elective shoulder surgery, a postoperative frozen shoulder was more common among the 24 patients with diabetes than among the surgical cohort as a whole (30 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OSTEOARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity is a risk factor for both osteoarthritis of the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and for type 2 diabetes. It has not been clear whether diabetes mellitus itself, independent of the mechanical and metabolic effects of obesity, was a risk factor for osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Observations from the Framingham osteoarthritis study included the finding of an increased prevalence of hand enthesophytes in subjects with self-reported diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]; however, data regarding the body mass index of subjects with or without hand enthesophytes were not provided. A cross-sectional study of Puerto Rican diabetic patients showed a 2.18-fold increased risk of hand or knee osteoarthritis after a multivariable analysis adjusting for known risk factors for osteoarthritis, including age, sex, and obesity. In this study, patients who used insulin alone for their diabetes were less likely to have osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A longitudinal cohort study showed that type 2 diabetes was an independent risk factor for severe osteoarthritis leading to hip and knee arthroplasty, independent of age and body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another prospective study, men with type 2 diabetes and established knee osteoarthritis had a greater rate of radiographic progression than men with knee osteoarthritis without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
