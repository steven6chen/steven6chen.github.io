After a brief period of initially normal development, affected patients experience loss of speech and purposeful hand use, stereotypic hand movements, and gait abnormalities. Additional manifestations include deceleration of head growth, seizures, autistic features, and breathing abnormalities.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment and prognosis of RTT. Other aspects of RTT are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rett syndrome: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717087636\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features and diagnosis of RTT are reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere.

Additional features of RTT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epilepsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorganized breathing pattern</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone mineral deficit and fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic nervous system dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disturbances</p><p/><p>The diagnosis of RTT is based upon clinical characteristics; regression of acquired skills occurs in all affected individuals. Typical RTT (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2830321633\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rett syndrome: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Typical RTT'</a>) should be suspected in girls who have apparently normal development in the first 6 to 18 months of life followed by regression of purposeful hand skills and spoken language along with the onset of gait abnormalities and stereotypic hand movements. Atypical RTT (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1217387243\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rett syndrome: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Atypical RTT'</a>) may be suspected in individuals who have many but not all of the clinical features of typical RTT.</p><p>The first important step in management is confirming the diagnosis of RTT (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rett syndrome: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>). This is often a relief to families who have searched for an explanation of their child's problems. It may also be the beginning of the grief process for the loss of a normal child. At the time of diagnosis, anticipatory guidance should be provided regarding the spectrum of clinical problems. All parents should be taught cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1989743613\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific therapy is available for RTT. Management consists of treating the associated conditions. A multidisciplinary approach is optimal. Aggressively addressing current health problems is important to improve the wellbeing and quality of life of patients with RTT and their families. Nutritional, gastrointestinal and motor problems are nearly universal among patients with RTT. These individuals also can be affected by seizures and nonepileptic behaviors, which should be identified in order to optimize therapy.</p><p>While there is currently no disease-modifying treatment for RTT, studies in Mecp2-mutant mice suggest potential therapeutic targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The few clinical trials in RTT populations have been largely negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One exception is a preliminary open-label trial of 10 girls with RTT, age &ge;10 years, which found that treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a> was associated with improved gait velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This finding requires confirmation in larger, more rigorous trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3742049020\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic growth should be closely monitored with attention to weight, height, and body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nutritional assessment and optimized feeding techniques are important. A high calorie, well-balanced diet should be provided with vitamins and minerals at the recommended dietary allowance. Energy intake should be increased with high-calorie supplements, either orally or by gastrostomy feeding, if needed to maintain adequate growth. Oromotor function should be assessed by videofluoroscopy in children who have choking, decreased control of secretions, frequent upper or lower respiratory infections, or weight loss. An individualized treatment plan should be developed including appropriate food and beverage consistencies, positioning, and the use of selected feeding utensils.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538945082\"><span class=\"h3\">GI dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a history of eating difficulty, eructation, emesis, or irritability should be evaluated for possible gastroesophageal reflux disease or delayed gastric emptying.

One approach is a program of daily prophylaxis. Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a> (17 g) dissolved in 8 oz of water, juice, or milk daily with titration up or down to tolerance, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-hydroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium hydroxide</a> 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> once a day with titration down to tolerance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1889683036\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone quality and fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, low bone mineral density is common and may lead to fractures. Consensus guidelines from an expert group recommend the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive assessment of bone health for patients with RTT that includes fracture history and assessment for risk factors such as more severe mutations (eg, R168X, R255X, R270X, or T158M), antiepileptic medications, pubertal development, mobility level, dietary intake, and biochemical bone markers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone densitometry at baseline, with subsequent monitoring every one to two years according to the presence of risk factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral spine radiographs.</p><p/><p>To improve bone health, the following measures are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased physical activity to increase muscle strength and bone density.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium supplementation when dietary intake is low.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D supplementation when levels are below normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bisphosphonate therapy for children and adolescents who meet criteria for osteoporosis from the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD), which require both a clinically significant history of bone fractures and low bone mineral content or low bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Conversely, many behavioral events identified by parents as seizures are nonepileptic. Thus, video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring may be necessary to differentiate nonepileptic behavioral events from actual seizures and to identify unrecognized seizures.</p><p>Most seizures associated with RTT are easily controlled and respond to standard antiepileptic drugs. Nevertheless, some patients with RTT have intractable seizures, and polytherapy with three or more anticonvulsant drugs has been used in up to 19 percent of patients with RTT and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A ketogenic diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] or vagus nerve stimulator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] may improve intractable seizures. However, in view of the frequent occurrence of growth failure in RTT, a ketogenic diet should be used with caution.

However, the optimal treatment of scoliosis in RTT is uncertain, and high-quality evidence supporting management strategies is limited. Guidelines for the management of scoliosis in patients with RTT, published in 2009, are based largely upon consensus opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The guidelines recommend a life-span approach that starts prior to the development of scoliosis and involves a comprehensive management team that includes medical, surgical, and therapy specialists. Physical assessment of the spine is recommended at least every six months. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon is recommended when there is clinical concern for scoliosis.</p><p>Although there is no evidence that physiotherapy can prevent progression of scoliosis, the guidelines recommend a therapy program that aims to prolong ambulation and maintain range of motion and proper seating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Bracing to control progression of the scoliosis does not appear to be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>], but it may be used for truncal stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Retrospective evidence suggests that surgical management can be beneficial for certain cases of scoliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]; the guidelines recommend consideration of spinal fusion when the Cobb angle is 40 to 50 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Specific disorders that disturb sleep should be considered, such as sleep apnea secondary to tonsillar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adenoidal hypertrophy, gastroesophageal reflux, and seizures.</p><p>Behavioral intervention should be attempted to treat dysfunctional sleep patterns. Good sleep hygiene should be encouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Measures include maintaining regular day and night routines, allowing the child only to sleep in bed, establishing a bedtime conducive to rapid sleep onset, removing the child from the bed if she does not fall asleep within one hour, and avoiding daytime sleep except for scheduled naps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other measures that may be helpful are taking a warm bath one to two hours before sleep, avoiding caffeine, exercising no later than three to four hours before bedtime, and following a routine bedtime ritual. Bright light exposure in the early morning promotes early sleep time, while evening exposure promotes later sleep time and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Pharmacologic agents are not consistently successful at correcting sleep disorders. Many disrupt the normal sleep architecture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have persistent effects on the following day. Alternative therapies may include short-acting, non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zaleplon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zaleplon</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>. Other sleep-inducing agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> have also been utilized. Melatonin has improved sleep disturbances in some patients with RTT, but further studies are needed before it can be recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3262013999\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A program of physical, occupational, and communication therapy should be provided for patients with RTT. Physical therapy is thought to promote ambulation and balance, prevent or retard the development of contractures, and control deformities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>The goal of occupational therapy is to promote purposeful use of the hands. Hand stereotypies can often be diminished by providing elbow or hand restraints. It may only be necessary to restrain the non-dominant hand or elbow. In several small series, splinting to inhibit repetitive hand activity was associated with improvements such as increased socialization and interaction with the environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. In our clinical experience, many therapists employ this technique with success. However, larger studies evaluating the effectiveness of hand splints are needed.</p><p>Communication therapy may enhance communication skills. Observation-based assessment approaches may be useful for communication intervention planning.</p><p>Other types of therapy may also be helpful, although few data are available to support their use. Music therapy may facilitate sustained focus, attention, and improve interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].

Since expected survival in RTT is beyond the fifth decade (see <a href=\"#H1425539486\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below), issues pertaining to adulthood and adult health care should be discussed with the family, including identification of appropriate health care providers for children and adults with RTT, guardianship, and long-term financial planning. </p><p>Individuals with RTT are totally dependent for all activities of living throughout their life. In our experience, most individuals with RTT live at home even as adults. Clinicians have long recognized the life-long burden on families caring for their family member with RTT, but there are few systematic studies investigating caregiver burden. Careful monitoring of the ability of older parents to care for their adult daughters with RTT is important to parental health, and supports the care of those older individuals with RTT. One study found that caregiver burden increased as caregiver health declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. There was a stronger association between the caregiver burden and parental health than with demands related to the individual with RTT. Another report found that mothers of individuals with RTT had lower physical and mental health scores compared with standard average scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These studies highlight the importance of assessing the physical and mental well-being of RTT caregivers.

After a period of initially normal development, affected children experience regression with partial or complete loss of speech and purposeful hand use, and onset of stereotypic hand movements, gait abnormalities, and other manifestations of RTT. Following the regression phase, there is a period of some recovery of nonverbal communication, with improved eye contact and nonverbal interactions with the environment. This is followed by a slow, insidious deterioration in gross motor function through adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>The type of MECP2 mutation appears to impact outcome in RTT, as reviewed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rett syndrome: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genotype-phenotype correlations'</a>).

Mortality affected 36 females (4 percent) with classic RTT and 5 females (6 percent) with atypical severe RTT. All females with atypical mild RTT remained alive during this period. Most deaths were caused by cardiopulmonary factors. Risk factors associated with mortality in classic RTT included ambulation, weight, and seizures. Specific MECP2 mutations were not significantly associated with mortality. This report suggested that aggressive health management and therapeutic approaches could further improve the prognosis for patients with RTT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report of 396 females with RTT who were followed for up to 20 years, the likelihood of survival at age 25 years was approximately 72 percent, and at age 37 years was approximately 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Information on the cause of death was available for 57 deceased females; the most common causes were respiratory illnesses (lower respiratory tract infection, aspiration, asphyxiation, and respiratory failure) in 82 percent, and seizure-related causes in 5 percent.</p><p/><p>There are only a limited number of studies of RTT in adulthood. In a combined cross-sectional cohort of 423 cases of women with RTT &ge;18 years of age, the following outcomes were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median age of the cohort was 25 years (range 18 to 54 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proportion living in their parental home was 71 percent; the remainder were living in group homes or institutions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proportion who walked independently was 18 percent, while those who walked with assistance accounted for 43 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scoliosis affected 86 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation affected 83 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal breathing patterns were reported for 66 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticonvulsant medications were used by 64 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disturbance affected 63 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low weight for age was present in 53 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallbladder disorders affected 5 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77344523\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No specific therapy is available for Rett syndrome (RTT). Management consists of treating the associated conditions. A multidisciplinary approach is optimal. A program of physical, occupational, and communication therapy should be provided. Specific issues that commonly require attention include growth failure and nutrition, bone quality, epilepsy, breathing dysfunction, cardiac abnormalities, scoliosis, sleep disturbance, and motor dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H1989743613\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of typical RTT is notable for a period of normal development for the first 6 to 18 months of life followed by a regression phase, with partial or complete loss of speech and purposeful hand use, and onset of stereotypic hand movements, gait abnormalities, and other manifestations of RTT. The regression phase is followed by a period of some recovery of nonverbal communication, but the long-term course is one of a slow deterioration in gross motor function. Respiratory illnesses and seizure-related conditions are the most common causes of death. However, most patients with RTT survive into adulthood.
