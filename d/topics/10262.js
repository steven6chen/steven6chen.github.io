Recognition of these toxicities, many of which are similar to the findings in spontaneous (endogenous) Cushing's syndrome, is of value in their prevention and management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major adverse effects seen with systemic (oral and parenteral) glucocorticoid therapy will be reviewed here. The adverse effects resulting from the use of inhaled, topical, and intraarticular glucocorticoids; glucocorticoid withdrawal; use during pregnancy; and the clinical manifestations of endogenous glucocorticoid excess are discussed in detail separately.

However, the attribution of causality to the glucocorticoids alone cannot always be clearly established. Other factors that may contribute to such adverse effects include the nature and severity of the underlying disease being treated and the other medications being concurrently administered. Estimates of the frequency and severity of adverse effects, as well as the respective dose and duration of therapy that may result in such adverse effects, are also limited by the modest number of prospective trials that address this question.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24131064\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids used in chronic disease (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>) do not have significant mineralocorticoid, androgenic, or estrogenic activity; thus, their major adverse effects result from inhibition of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function and the development of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-use-of-glucocorticoids#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Complications of chronic use'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors and result from both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms that also have a role in the therapeutic effects of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Genetic polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor and in glucocorticoid metabolism may explain heterogeneity in glucocorticoid toxicities observed. These effects lead to adverse effects from transactivation, which leads to increased expression of regulatory and antiinflammatory proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; by contrast, many of the clinically desirable effects appear to result primarily from transrepression, which results in the decreased production of proinflammatory proteins. However, the mechanisms of glucocorticoid transactivation and transrepression are poorly understood. Nongenomic effects of glucocorticoids include rapid, nonspecific interactions of glucocorticoids with cellular membranes, nongenomic effects medicated by cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors, and specific interactions with membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose-related effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several retrospective reviews have shown that long-term glucocorticoid use, even in low doses, is a significant independent predictor of numerous adverse effects and that the risk is both dose- and duration-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. As an example, a study of 112 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients found that the average daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose was the strongest predictor of an adverse effect potentially attributable to glucocorticoid therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 4.5 for 5 to 10 mg and 32.3 for 10 to 15 mg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53432\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53432 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The preselected adverse effects included in the analysis were fracture, serious infections, gastrointestinal bleed or ulcer, and cataracts. The glucocorticoid-adverse effect association persisted after statistical adjustment for significant disease severity factors, such as the presence of rheumatoid nodules and bony erosions. There are also some data that have suggested that very low doses of glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> are associated with fewer adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>A linear and threshold pattern of dose-related adverse effects have been described for different adverse effects. A large retrospective analysis, which included data from 1066 RA patients on glucocorticoids for more than six months, observed a &quot;linear&quot; pattern with increasing dose for Cushingoid phenotype, ecchymosis, leg edema, mycosis, parchment-like skin, shortness of breath, and sleep disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A &quot;threshold&quot; pattern, which described an elevated frequency of events beyond a certain threshold value, occurred at doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> greater than 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in which there was an increased frequency of glaucoma, depression, and elevated blood pressure. Also, at doses of prednisone greater than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> there was an increased frequency of weight gain and epistaxis. Cataracts were more common among patients on glucocorticoids, even when the prednisone dose was less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>One study suggests that even short-term glucocorticoid use may be associated with serious adverse effects. A retrospective cohort study and self-controlled case series that used a nationwide dataset of private insurance claims in the United States assessed the risk of three adverse effects (sepsis, venous thromboembolism [VTE], and fracture) in 327,452 adults younger than 65 who received at least one short-term (&lt;30 days) outpatient prescription over a three-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Within 30 days of drug initiation, there was an increase in the rates of sepsis (incidence rate ratio 5.30, 95% CI 3.80-7.41), VTE (incidence rate ratio 3.33, 95% CI 2.78-3.00), and fracture (incidence rate ratio 1.887, 95% CI 1.69-2.07), which then decreased over the subsequent 31 to 90 days. The issue of verification of diagnoses remains a significant issue in these large databases and means that these results must be viewed with some skepticism. In addition, time-varying factors such as an exacerbation of a serious inflammatory condition requiring glucocorticoids but also predisposing to one of the three outcomes could have been differentially distributed between the risk and baseline periods. Further, the absolute risks of each of the adverse effects was low. Only 6.3 percent of the prescriptions were for a prednisone-equivalent dose of less than 17.5 mg a day, suggesting that most of the exposures were to relatively higher doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ORGAN-BASED TOXICITY OF SYSTEMIC GLUCOCORTICOIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids have adverse effects on many organ systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65998\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65998 \">table 1</a>). Adverse effects range from those that are not necessarily serious but are displeasing to patients (eg, Cushingoid appearance) to those that are life-threatening (eg, serious infections). Some adverse effects, such as accelerated reductions in bone mineral density or early cataracts, may be largely asymptomatic until later manifestations develop that require medical attention (eg, acute vertebral collapse, cataract requiring surgical extraction). Estimates of the frequency of particular adverse effects vary between studies and depend in part on the specific condition being treated and on the glucocorticoid treatment regimen being used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. With the exception of cataracts, a potential acceleration in atherosclerotic vascular disease, and bone effects (osteoporosis and osteonecrosis), all glucocorticoid toxicity is at least partially reversible over time with glucocorticoid discontinuation. (See <a href=\"#H343418\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment considerations and monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermatologic effects and appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinically relevant adverse effects of glucocorticoids on the skin and appearance that have been observed even at lower doses include skin thinning and ecchymoses, Cushingoid appearance, acne, weight gain, mild hirsutism, facial erythema, and striae. We discuss some of the major dermatologic effects in more detail below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin thinning and ecchymoses</strong> &ndash; Among the most common toxicities attributable to glucocorticoids are skin thinning and ecchymoses, even at low doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A large observational study with patient-reported data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on glucocorticoids for at least six months reported rates of parchment-like skin and ecchymoses in 10 and 17 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The prevalence of these effects also increased with higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. In a prospective study with 80 patients, skin changes were observed in 46 percent of patients treated for three months with prednisone at doses greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The ecchymoses or purpura associated with glucocorticoid use often affects the sun-exposed areas of the dorsum of the hand and forearm and is not accompanied by palpable swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-macular-skin-lesions#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with macular skin lesions&quot;, section on 'Solar purpura (senile purpura)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cushingoid features</strong> &ndash; The development of Cushingoid features (redistribution of body fat with truncal obesity, buffalo hump, and moon face) and weight gain are dose- and duration-dependent and can develop within the first two months of therapy. A Cushingoid appearance can be quite troubling to patients and can develop even with low-dose therapy; however, it is uncommon at doses below the physiologic glucocorticoid-replacement range. Factors that may also contribute to increased weight include an increased appetite, a common side effect of glucocorticoid therapy, and an increase in food intake for symptomatic relief in patients with gastropathy or peptic ulcer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal effects'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome#H3724384877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Progressive obesity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight gain</strong> &ndash; Several observational studies have assessed the frequency of Cushingoid features and weight gain. In an observational study of 779 patients with RA, weight gain was more frequent in patients treated with at least 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or equivalent for at least six months, compared with those who had not received any for at least 12 months (22.4 versus 9.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, there was a threshold effect, such that the rate of weight gain was not increased in those who took less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (8.7 percent) or further increased at doses greater than 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (21.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By contrast, Cushingoid features showed a linear increase in frequency with dose rather than a threshold effect. Among patients who had received &lt;5, 5 to 7.5, and &gt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of prednisone or equivalent, Cushingoid features were observed in 4.3, 15.8, and 24.6 percent of patients, respectively. In another study with survey data from 2167 long-term users of glucocorticoids (mean prednisone equivalent dose &plusmn; standard deviation [SD] of 16&plusmn;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for &ge;60 days), weight gain was the most common self-reported adverse effect (70 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In those on &le;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of prednisone or equivalent, increasing duration of use was significantly associated with weight gain. Also, in an analysis of four prospective trials of glucocorticoids in RA, the use of 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of prednisone or equivalent over two years was associated with an increase of mean body weight of 4 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ophthalmologic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of both cataracts and glaucoma is increased in patients on glucocorticoids and is dose-related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open-angle glaucoma: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angle-closure-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angle-closure glaucoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cataracts</strong> &ndash; Cataracts commonly occur after prolonged glucocorticoid use. They are usually bilateral and develop slowly. They typically occur in a posterior subcapsular location and can usually be distinguished from senile cataracts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There may be no minimal safe dose with respect to the risk of cataract formation, although risk is dose- and time-dependent and is more common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> doses greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or with medications that have been administered for more than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In a study that evaluated 122 patients with RA taking a mean dose of prednisone of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for an average of 6.9 years, 29 percent developed cataracts compared with 18 percent of matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Another study of patients with RA receiving a mean dose of 6 mg of prednisone daily for a mean of six years also found cataracts more common in patients on glucocorticoids than in patients not using prednisone (15 versus 4.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased intraocular pressure</strong> &ndash; Glucocorticoids can also increase intraocular pressure, but these effects can usually be controlled with appropriate medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>]. This form of glaucoma occurs most commonly in patients who use glucocorticoid eye drops, although it has been observed in chronic and, to a lesser extent, acute systemic glucocorticoid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk of glaucoma or worsening intraocular pressure is greater in patients on glucocorticoids who are otherwise predisposed to this disorder or who have certain comorbidities, including those with a positive family history of glaucoma and diabetes mellitus or high myopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19</a>]. In patients with preexisting open- or closed-angle glaucoma, the use of glucocorticoids will frequently aggravate the condition (46 to 92 and 65 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exophthalmos</strong> &ndash; Exophthalmos and swelling of the lids and ocular muscles are rare ophthalmologic complications of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p>A rare adverse effect of systemic, local, or even topical use of glucocorticoids is central serous chorioretinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. This type of chorioretinopathy is associated with edema formation that can separate the retina from the choroid. Reduction of glucocorticoid dose is the most important element of treatment if it can be done without causing a dangerous exacerbation of the disease that is being treated with the glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid use has been associated with a variety of adverse cardiovascular effects including fluid retention, premature atherosclerotic disease, and arrhythmias. Cardiovascular disease risk is dose-dependent and may be low or absent in patients on low-dose glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluid retention and hypertension</strong> &ndash; Higher-dose glucocorticoids may promote fluid retention, which is of particular concern to patients with underlying heart or kidney disease. This is not a problem in normal subjects because of the phenomenon of mineralocorticoid escape that prevents progressive fluid overload (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>). Hypertension is a known adverse effect of glucocorticoids and has been observed in up to 20 percent of patients with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; however, it is a dose-related adverse effect and is unlikely to occur at lower doses of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some studies have shown that long-term use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in RA patients can be associated with a higher risk of hypertension, although the data are inconsistent when low doses of glucocorticoids are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. In patients receiving low doses of glucocorticoids (eg, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of prednisone), significant hypertension may be better explained by age and initial blood pressure than by the glucocorticoids themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The mechanism by which glucocorticoid therapy can raise the blood pressure is not well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome#H225733108\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Hypertension'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Premature atherosclerotic disease</strong> &ndash; Glucocorticoid use has been associated with increased rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/27,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,35</a>]. Increasing attention is being given to the increased risk of premature atherosclerosis in RA and other systemic rheumatic disease. Thus, the relative risks of cardiovascular events associated with glucocorticoid use may be confounded by the role of the underlying inflammatory disease of the vascular endothelium. In a large population-based study comparing 68,781 glucocorticoid users with 82,303 nonusers who had never been hospitalized for cardiovascular disease, patients who received glucocorticoid doses &ge;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> were more than 2.5 times more likely than patients who did not receive glucocorticoids to experience a cardiovascular event (defined as myocardial infarction, angina, coronary revascularization, hospitalization for heart failure, transient ischemic attack [TIA], or stroke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similarly, in another large retrospective case-control study, an increased risk of ischemic heart disease and heart failure was associated with current glucocorticoid use (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] 2.7 and 1.2, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Neither of these studies included the role of disease-modifying agents or disease activity among the patients who were included who had a systemic rheumatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies in which the patients were limited to systemic rheumatic diseases found more variable results in terms of glucocorticoid use and cardiovascular disease risk. As an example, a prospective cohort study with 364 polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) patients followed for a median of 7.6 years found that there was no increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes in patients treated with glucocorticoids compared with the group of patients who just received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. By contrast, a large population-based study of 8384 patients with incident RA found that glucocorticoid use was associated with a 68 percent increased risk of myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The risk of myocardial infarction increased by 13 percent for each 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> increase in glucocorticoid dose. However, the potential for unmeasured confounders and possible misclassification using administrative data limit these findings. Also, a randomized trial with 223 early RA patients followed prospectively for 10 years found an increased risk of cerebrovascular events in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> compared with those not receiving prednisolone (hazard ratio [HR] 3.7 [1.2-11.4]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in composite cardiovascular events (which included an acute myocardial infarction or an ischemic stroke) or a first coronary event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The development of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome may be a marker for patients at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. A cohort of 547 patients diagnosed with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome in a large general practice database had a significantly greater risk of a cardiovascular event compared with patients who were receiving similar doses of glucocorticoids but who did not have a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and patients who did not receive glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In a population-based case-control study, current glucocorticoid use was more common among 20,221 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter compared with the 202,130 population controls (6.4 versus 2.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Currently using glucocorticoids was associated with a significant increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter, compared with never having used glucocorticoids (adjusted OR 1.9). Risk was increased for new users and long-term users, but not for former users (ORs 3.6, 1.7, and 1.0, respectively) and was unrelated to whether or not pulmonary or cardiovascular disease was present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serious adverse cardiovascular toxicities, including sudden death, have been reported in occasional patients who have been given pulse infusions of glucocorticoids (eg, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> for multiple infusions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In many of these cases, however, it was difficult to determine whether this adverse effect was more likely attributable to glucocorticoids or to the underlying disorder necessitating the therapy. Thus, cardiac monitoring is indicated in patients with significant cardiac disease who are treated with pulse glucocorticoid therapy, especially those on diuretics, the use of which may also be associated with electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Possible hyperlipidemia</strong> &ndash; The effect of glucocorticoids on atherosclerotic vascular disease is thought to be mediated in part by elevated nonfunctional lipoprotein levels. However, studies analyzing this issue have had mixed results, and beneficial effects of glucocorticoids on dyslipidemia have also been observed. In one report, moderate- to low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> tapered to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> over three months) had no significant adverse effect on lipoprotein levels if other risk factors were taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another observational study concluded that glucocorticoid use was associated with a more favorable lipid profile in older adults (&ge;60 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Studies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have indicated that the adverse effects of glucocorticoids on lipid profiles are dose-dependent, occurring only at prednisone doses greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. Interpretation of these data is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing effects due to disease activity from effects directly related to the medications themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A rodent study found that the combination of prednisone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> improves the lipid profile better than either drug alone; however, we are unaware of direct data in humans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Glucocorticoids may act by leading sequentially to peripheral insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and increased hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. However, glucocorticoid-induced reduction in corticotropin (ACTH) release also contributes to the lipid changes. In one report, for example, the administration of ACTH for three weeks to nine hyperlipidemic, glucocorticoid-treated patients (five of whom were transplant recipients) led to substantial reductions in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides and to an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

In most patients, these symptoms are mild and reversible, but emotional lability, hypomania, mania, depression, psychosis, delirium, confusion, or disorientation (which are more common in older patients), and cognitive changes including memory deficits may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Disturbances in sleep are reported, especially with split doses that may interfere with the normal pattern of diurnal cortisol production. Akathisia (motor restlessness) is a common glucocorticoid side effect.

We describe several conditions in more depth below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mood disorders</strong> &ndash; Patients receiving glucocorticoids often experience an improved sense of well-being within several days of starting the medications; mild euphoria or anxiety may also be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/64,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,66,67</a>]. Hypomanic reactions and activated states are more common early in therapy than is depression, but the prevalence of depression is greater in patients on more longstanding therapy, even on low to moderate doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/64,66,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,66,68</a>].

The effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors and result from both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms that also have a role in the therapeutic effects of these agents. Genetic polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor and in glucocorticoid metabolism may explain heterogeneity in glucocorticoid toxicities observed.

Adverse effects range from those that are not necessarily serious but are displeasing to patients (eg, Cushingoid appearance) to those that are life-threatening (eg, serious infections). Some adverse effects, such as accelerated reductions in bone mineral density or early cataracts, may be largely asymptomatic until later manifestations develop that require medical attention (eg, acute vertebral collapse, cataract requiring surgical extraction).
