Focal ATs arise from a single site within the left or right atrium, in contrast to macroreentrant atrial arrhythmias (eg, atrial flutter) and atrial fibrillation, which involve multiple sites or larger circuits.</p><p>In the past, focal ATs were considered to be due predominantly to enhanced automaticity. Thus, they were often referred to as automatic ATs. However, the more inclusive term focal AT is preferred, as this encompasses automatic, triggered, and microreentrant etiologies that cannot be distinguished easily on the surface electrocardiogram.</p><p>Focal ATs are usually paroxysmal and self-limited, although in some patients, focal AT may be present nearly continuously (ie, incessant AT). Incessant AT is important as it may be associated with left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The non-coronary cusp is an unusual site for atrial tachycardia, which should be considered for apparent paraseptal tachycardias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal AT may occur in patients with organic heart disease in response to atrial stretch due to elevated atrial pressure in conditions such as hypertension and cardiomyopathy. In addition to chronic heart disease, AT can also be associated with acute events such as a myocardial infarction, pulmonary decompensation, infection, excessive alcohol ingestion, hypokalemia, hypoxia, stimulants, cocaine ingestion, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Incessant AT is often found in otherwise normal young individuals, including children, although it may occur in patients with organic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. The rate tends to be faster during the day than at night, and the rate may increase with exercise or pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Incessant focal AT may be responsible for tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, which refers to left ventricular (LV) chamber dilatation and systolic dysfunction in a patient with persistent tachyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/18,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21,22</a>]. Focal ATs originating in the atrial appendages and pulmonary veins are more frequently associated with cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1542581\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-atrial fibrillation ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of atrial tachycardia appears to be higher among patients who have undergone catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Catheter ablation of persistent AF may involve an extensive biatrial ablation strategy that combines linear ablation and the targeting of complex fractionated activity beyond pulmonary vein isolation. In a multicenter international randomized study, catheter ablation for persistent AF that involved targeting complex fractionated activity or linear ablation was not associated with an increase in freedom from AF compared with pulmonary vein isolation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This study may translate to a more conservative approach to atrial substrate modification with a consequent reduction in post ablation atrial tachycardia. ATs post-AF ablation are often incessant, associated with rapid ventricular rates, and respond poorly to pharmacologic measures. Although they may be seen as a positive sign in the longer-term restoration of sinus rhythm, post-AF ablation AT poses specific challenges often requiring repeat catheter ablation procedures.

Digitalis should be discontinued in this case, and anti-digitalis antibodies should be considered if hemodynamic compromise is present or other dangerous arrhythmias accompany the tachycardia.

Palpitations can manifest in different ways. The abrupt onset of a rapid fluttering sensation in the chest or neck is most consistent with a tachyarrhythmia such as focal AT. The symptom burden is typically higher in focal compared with reentrant supraventricular tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-palpitations-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of palpitations in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with focal AT can rarely present with syncope, predominantly if the ventricular heart rate exceeds 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span>. Syncope, however, is more frequently seen with a ventricular tachyarrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia than with focal AT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies#H94450988\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;, section on 'Cardiac arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with other underlying cardiac comorbidities (eg, heart failure, angina) can present with symptoms associated with worsening of their underlying disease (eg, dyspnea, chest pain).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15492827\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of focal AT is based primarily on electrocardiographic (ECG) findings demonstrating an atrial arrhythmia of &gt;100 beats per minute originating from outside the sinus node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The tachycardia is generally sudden in onset and offset and frequently demonstrates a change in P wave morphology. Focal AT is suggested by bursts of atrial activity with an isoelectric interval between P waves with confirmation of &ldquo;focal&rdquo; as opposed to macroreentry dependent on the findings at EP study. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiologic study and catheter ablation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiographic features</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">P waves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The atrial rate during focal AT is generally between 110 and 250 beats per minute. Infants, children and young adults often have faster rates. </p><p>The P wave morphology can appear normal or abnormal, depending upon the site of origin of the tachycardia. If the focus is from the superior portion of the crista terminalis, the P wave may be similar in appearance to the sinus P wave. Usually, there is a subtle difference in P waves from sinus rhythm to AT, so comparison with an ECG with known sinus P waves is recommended whenever possible. ECG leads V1 and lead II are the most useful in assessing P wave morphology.</p><p>Observation over several minutes with multiple ECGs is invaluable in distinguishing focal AT from sinus tachycardia. Although focal ATs are regular, the rate may accelerate or &quot;warm up&quot; in the first few beats of the tachycardia and decelerate in the last few beats. An abrupt onset or termination (eg, over three to four beats) favors a focal AT. Sinus tachycardia requires 30 seconds to several minutes to speed up or slow down.</p><p>In occasional patients, intracardiac atrial depolarizations can be recorded during electrophysiologic study, yet no P waves appear on the surface ECG. Thus, the ECG alone suggests atrioventricular (AV) junctional tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This may occur if the atrial and ventricular complexes are closely associated such that the P wave is buried in the QRS complex. Reentrant AV junctional tachycardias can also simulate atrial tachycardia by presenting with inverted P waves shortly before the QRS complex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrioventricular relationship</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In focal AT, AV conduction is usually 1:1. The PR interval is often in the normal range, producing a long R-P interval, which can help to distinguish focal AT from other forms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'RP relationship'</a>.)</p><p>Mobitz type 1 and 2 conduction may also be seen depending on the rate of the atrial tachycardia and the conducting properties of the AV node. The appearance of &quot;grouped beating&quot; as seen in Mobitz type 1 conduction (Wenckebach) favors focal atrial tachycardia as the responsible mechanism for SVT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">QRS morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The QRS morphology is usually the same as in sinus rhythm, although aberrant conduction may occur at higher ventricular rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189482685\"><span class=\"h2\">Localization of AT focus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Algorithms which attempt to predict the origin of the atrial tachycardia focus have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/6,10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,27</a>]. A series of 126 patients undergoing electrophysiology study for focal atrial tachycardia led to the development of an algorithm that was able to predict the arrhythmogenic focus in 93 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53718\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53718 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This algorithm is most useful for predicting the site of AT origin to guide mapping and ablation at the time of electrophysiology study. </p><p>The algorithm begins with an evaluation of the P wave in lead V1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the P wave in V1 is negative or biphasic with an initially <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/terminally</span> negative deflection, the AT focus is likely in the right atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74611\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74611 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50523\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef50523 \">waveform 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the P wave in V1 is positive or biphasic with an initially <span class=\"nowrap\">negative/terminally</span> positive deflection, the AT focus is likely in the left atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57390\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57390 \">waveform 3</a>). </p><p/><p>With close inspection of the P wave in other leads, likely sites of origin could be predicted, including those in the coronary sinus, crista terminalis, left atrial appendage, right atrial appendage, interatrial septum, or pulmonary veins. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiologic study and catheter ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrophysiologic evaluation of ATs is complex and the characteristics of the arrhythmia depend upon the mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The studies are best performed initially under light sedation as automatic ATs may be more difficult to induce under deeper sedation or general anesthesia. Other ATs are inducible by programmed extrastimulation, and less sensitive to the effects of anesthesia. The findings on electrophysiologic study vary depending upon the mechanism of AT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Automatic ATs cannot be initiated, entrained, or terminated by electrophysiologic stimulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F90888\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef90888 \">waveform 4</a>).

Once a focus has been identified, treatment with catheter ablation can be performed during the same setting. The development of high density multi-electrode mapping catheters can assist in the localization of focal AT.

However, because of the unique risk profiles of each of these agents, decisions regarding the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, other than amiodarone, should be made with the assistance of a cardiologist experienced in arrhythmia management. In particular, class Ic drugs are contraindicated in the setting of structural heart disease. In patients without structural heart disease, sotalol or flecainide is preferable to amiodarone as they are less toxic long-term therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with hemodynamically unstable AT with a rapid ventricular response who do not respond to medical therapy and do not have a reversible precipitating cause, we suggest an attempt at electrical cardioversion. <br/><br/>However, ATs may be particularly resistant to cardioversion for two reasons. First, many ATs are caused by enhanced automaticity, and electrical cardioversion is ineffective for such arrhythmias. Secondly, ATs are often precipitated by significant underlying illnesses that both limit the efficacy of cardioversion and increase the likelihood of early arrhythmia recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiologic mechanisms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Hemodynamically unstable patients with persistent AT despite treatment with rate-controlling medications and efforts at electrical cardioversion should have an attempt at chemical cardioversion using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4348457\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic or maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic therapy of repetitive focal AT is designed to prevent arrhythmia recurrence and to control the ventricular rate if the arrhythmia recurs. Patients with relatively rare and brief arrhythmias and few or no symptoms do not require chronic therapy. In the absence of coexisting atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/flutter,</span> atrial tachycardia carries a low risk of systemic embolization and chronic oral anticoagulation is not necessary. </p><p>The published literature addressing chronic suppressive treatment of AT includes only observational studies of small numbers of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Some of these studies included patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, which have different mechanisms and may respond differently to therapy. With these limitations in mind, we suggest the following approach for chronic treatment of patients with frequent or symptomatic AT, which is in general agreement with the 2015 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/HRS</span> guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since focal AT may be short in duration and resolve spontaneously, we suggest initial therapy with oral beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>).

The threshold for considering catheter ablation is lower for younger patients and in patients with tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H17173656\" class=\"local\">'Incessant AT resulting in cardiomyopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More aggressive antiarrhythmic drugs may be considered for patients who fail beta blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> who do not want or are not good candidates for ablation therapy. In patients with significant comorbidities and structural heart disease, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is frequently the preferred agent. As with acute therapy of ATs however, other class Ic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>), or class III (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>) antiarrhythmic drugs can be used in appropriately selected patients.

Atrial tachycardia can originate from any site in the right or left atrium, and even from the proximal pulmonary veins or superior vena cava. Identification of a tachycardia's origin as left versus right atrial may be difficult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62431\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62431 \">figure 2</a>) but can usually be successfully predicted using the surface ECG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53718\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53718 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Even patients with normal left ventricular systolic function on initial presentation are at risk of developing a cardiomyopathy following extended periods of tachycardia. This LV systolic dysfunction typically reverses weeks to months following the restoration of sinus rhythm. As such, aggressive efforts should be made to restore normal sinus rhythm in an attempt to prevent or reverse LV systolic dysfunction.

For this reason, if medical therapy with rate-controlling medications and antiarrhythmic drugs is unsuccessful, patients with AT and concomitant LV systolic dysfunction should undergo catheter ablation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50523\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef50523 \">waveform 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-atrial-tachycardia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Only 10 to 15 percent of patients will have recurrence of AT following catheter ablation.

Focal AT accounts for between 5 and 15 percent of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in adults. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of ATs originate in the right atrium along the tricuspid annulus or the crista terminalis. Left atrial AT predominantly originates near the pulmonary veins. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Sites of origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with focal AT report palpitations associated with their episodes of tachycardia. Rarely, patients may present with syncope or exacerbation of an underlying cardiac condition (eg, angina). (See <a href=\"#H20806678\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The P wave morphology can appear normal or abnormal, depending upon the site of origin of the tachycardia. Usually, there is a subtle difference in P waves from sinus rhythm to AT, so comparison with an ECG with known sinus P waves is advised, whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acute treatment of patients with AT depends upon the presence of symptoms and the patient&rsquo;s hemodynamic status:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For an asymptomatic hemodynamically stable patient with AT, we suggest initial observation rather than acute treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Such treatment may slow the ventricular response <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> terminate the arrhythmia. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is an acceptable alternative that may be preferred in a patient with borderline hypotension.
