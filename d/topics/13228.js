Palliative care is appropriate for conditions in which any of the following apply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Curative treatment is possible but may fail &minus; This includes children with cancer, awaiting solid organ transplantation, or with severe congenital heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive long-term treatment maintains quality of life for a chronic potentially progressive condition &minus; This includes children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and severe immunodeficiencies including human immunodeficiency virus infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The focus of care is palliative for progressive conditions without a curative option &minus; This includes infants with trisomy 13 or 18, type II osteogenesis imperfecta, and spinal muscular atrophy type I.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonprogressive irreversible conditions with extreme vulnerability to health complications &minus; Children with severe developmental disabilities, such as those with severe cerebral palsy, hypoxic brain injury, or brain malformations.</p><p/><p>Based on these selection criteria, pediatric palliative care is provided to children with a wide range of primary conditions. This was illustrated by a prospective study from six pediatric hospital-based palliative care teams in the United States that consulted on 515 new cases during a three month period in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The following conditions and their frequency were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic or congenital diseases &ndash; 41 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular disorders &ndash; 39 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer &ndash; 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory diseases &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal diseases &ndash; 11 percent</p><p/><p>Almost half of the patients also chronically used some form of medical technology (eg, gastrostomy tubes), and approximately one-third were cognitively impaired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Families of children with a diagnosis where cure may not be possible are ideally introduced to palliative care at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Palliative care is introduced from the beginning of the treatment by acknowledging that it helps to ensure an ongoing focus on quality of life with relief of symptoms so that the child's enjoyment of life can continue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p>This may include prenatal palliative care when a life-threatening fetal diagnosis is made, at the time of a new life-threatening diagnosis in a child, or as disease modifying treatment in a chronic condition has declining benefit.</p><p>Children with chronic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis or severe neurological impairment, may benefit from the introduction of palliative care if symptom management is difficult or if there is significant suffering. This often becomes evident at a time of decline in health status, which results in uncertainty regarding outcome, and impacts quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Overly optimistic estimates of prognosis are a common barrier to initiation of palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, the introduction of palliative care does not mean that curative treatments, which seek to reverse the disease process, or disease modifying treatments when cure is not possible, need to be terminated if they remain appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although medical teams often worry that families &quot;are not ready&quot; to address these issues, evidence shows that integration of palliative care does not lessen parents' hope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, prognostic information that clinicians consider upsetting does not lessen a parent's desire for this information, and is often considered important to decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Palliative care recognizes that there is always care to provide, such as attention to physical symptoms or emotional distress, regardless of the clinical situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/5,8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,17</a>]. In the setting of a poor prognosis, palliative care has a positive benefit for preparing families for later bereavement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Parents and families who are poorly prepared in addressing quality of life tend to choose more intensive and invasive interventions that may prolong suffering near the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Integration of palliative care for a child requires a customized care plan developed based on goals that enhance the quality of life of the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family.

Disciplines required for the spectrum of palliative care needs of the child and family typically include a clinician, clinical nurse specialist or advanced practice nurse, chaplain, social worker, and child life specialist.

It is based upon building a strong relationship between the care team and the child and family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients with life-threatening illnesses and their families emphasize the importance of having a long-term relationship with their care team in order to promote open and effective communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The process of transitioning from one set of goals (ie, curing the condition) to another (ie, reducing suffering and maintaining the child's quality of life) involves many factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Hopeful patterns of thinking and the use of heuristics to simplify complex situations play particularly important roles in communication and parental decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Talking to children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a child is facing a life-threatening condition, parents are the legal decision makers about treatment options, including the introduction of palliative or hospice care services.

Helping children understand what is happening to them physically, emotionally, and spiritually facilitates their comfort and reduces their anxiety. In particular, adolescents with terminal illnesses want to be involved in the medical decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Children report that they are more comfortable with clinicians who take the time to communicate with them directly.

For some families, spirituality may be found and expressed through an organized religion, but for others, spirituality is expressed outside of such structures. Interdisciplinary care that explores spiritual needs can provide an avenue for expression of the beliefs, values, hopes, and fears that ultimately guide decisions and impact grieving. Providing assistance to families regarding spirituality and discussion about death often includes the patient, parents, and the child's siblings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of spirituality in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serious illness naturally raises questions for patients and parents of &quot;why me?&quot;, with a desire to seek meaning at such times.

Physicians may also fear that they will create false hope if they support hopeful statements from a parent. However, some evidence suggests that parents who exhibit hopeful patterns of thinking and emotion may ultimately be more likely to institute limitations of care for their children compared with parents who are less hopeful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Hope can be an effective adaptive approach to adversity for some and can be a means to convey commitment and love to one's child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Developing care plans based on goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical team and family need to establish patient-centered goals of care with attention to relief of the child and family's distress. The goals of palliative care do not necessarily exclude the goals of disease-directed therapy. For example, children with cancer and their parents often have simultaneous goals for palliative care to lessen suffering and for cancer-directed therapy to extend life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The child's well-being should be the primary guide. The job of the parents and care providers is to watch, listen, and reflect honestly on what is in the best interest of the child.

The decision to implement such interventions needs to be considered within the context of the goals of the child (fetus) and family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The following steps are useful in achieving a good decision.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify the likelihood of an intervention meeting the goals of care of the patient and family.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Know and discuss the evidence for the possible benefit and harm of the interventions available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Define a time period in which the intervention would be expected to meet the identified goals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss a back-up plan in case the hoped for benefit does not occur or increased suffering occurs. This may include stopping the treatment or shifting the overall focus from curative treatment to comfort measures.</p><p/><p>To avoid misunderstanding, during these discussions, it should be made clear to the family that the care team is not trying to limit treatments that may have reasonable benefit. The goal is to protect the child from interventions with little or no benefit that may harm or prolong suffering, and to provide care that maximizes comfort throughout the child's life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Resuscitation and life-sustaining measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a child with life-threatening illness, invasive and life-sustaining interventions, such as resuscitative measures (eg, intubation), are available even at the end of life. Prior to a life-threatening event, it is important to consider whether such interventions should be performed. Early discussion allows children and parents to make decisions that fit with their values and goals of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This assessment should consider whether any of the proposed interventions (eg, intubation, chest compressions, defibrillation) will result in a desired outcome.</p><p>Discussing resuscitative and life-sustaining efforts requires an honest assessment of the likelihood of benefit and possible harm, and is based upon the steps discussed above. It is important that the care team assume responsibility for this process so as to not imply undue parental responsibility for any decision regarding life-sustaining measures. This is ideally a process of shared decision-making. As an example, avoid asking &ldquo;Do you want your child to be intubated?&rdquo;. This focused question implies offering something that would benefit the child and shifts the decision-making burden to the parents. It is also important to reassure patients and families that a decision to forgo life-sustaining measures will not alter ongoing care of a patient.</p><p>This is also a time to remind families that when there is a decline in health, it is not a result of any decisions made to limit interventions or of the care provided at home, but rather a result of the health problems that cannot be &quot;cured&quot; or &quot;fixed&quot;. The family should be reassured that interventions will continue as long as they maintain sufficient benefit to quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Health care proxy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appointing a health care proxy allows a patient over 18 years of age to designate someone to make medical decisions if the patient is unable to make or communicate those decisions. A social worker or other trusted team member involved with the patient can assist with the process of identifying someone the patient trusts, and filling out the necessary documentation. This process also provides an opportunity to discuss goals of care, decision making, and assure knowledge of the patient's preferences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73563633\"><span class=\"h3\">Perinatal palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assisting families facing a life-threatening fetal diagnosis involves unique challenges, yet utilizes the principles outlined above. Families benefit from the opportunity to prepare and plan prior to delivery. This planning involves supportive care for the mother during labor and delivery, involvement of the father when appropriate, and care plans that account for variable outcomes of the baby. A birth plan can be developed that indicates the care plan for the baby following delivery. Communication is an essential part of planning to ensure that interventions that are consistent with the parents' goals for their baby are implemented. This may involve a decision <strong>not</strong> to resuscitate (including intubation and insertion of intravascular access) and to focus on the child's comfort while parents maximize their time together as a family. When appropriate, parents can have supportive plans in place if the child survives, such as identifying home-based palliative and hospice care. There are a number of excellent resources to provide guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Coordination of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal care is only possible when critical information is documented and communicated to all parties involved in the child's care. This coordination of care must take into consideration the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locations of care &minus; Location of care includes medical facilities (clinics, hospitals, and emergency services) and community sites in which the child lives (home, respite care, school, and sometimes community based transportation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals involved in the child's care &minus; This includes family, health care proxy (often a family member), home care nurses, providers of care in foster care or group homes, school nurses and teachers, respite care providers, bus drivers, health care teams (primary care providers, specialty clinicians, other members of these medical teams), and palliative <span class=\"nowrap\">care/hospice</span> teams.</p><p/><p>It is also beneficial to identify (with parental agreement) what information should be shared with these individuals. This can lessen any sense of &quot;Why are they doing this?&quot; and help direct others involved in the child's care to focus on the primary goal of enhancing the quality of life for the child.</p><p>Documented information should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals of care and how these goals guide decisions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care and symptom management plans</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of health care for acute illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resuscitation status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Care plans for a life-threatening event at home and school</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact information for individuals with expertise and availability to assist at times of acute events (designated clinician or palliative <span class=\"nowrap\">care/hospice</span> team)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms commonly identified in children with life-threatening illness include pain, dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, depression and anxiety, delirium and agitation, sleep disturbance, anemia and bleeding, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-47</a>].

It is a common symptom found in numerous medical disorders. Measures of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood gas levels, and family perception do not necessarily correlate with the patient's perception of breathlessness. A child may be able to report the degree of distress associated with dyspnea using a scale similar to the visual analogue scale used for pain. Although instruments are available for assessing dyspnea, including the Respiratory Distress Observational Scale, which is used in adults unable to report about symptoms, they have not been validated in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>Treating dyspnea is typically focused on identifying and treating the underlying cause. Causes of dyspnea include pulmonary disease (eg, pneumonia and primary interstitial disease), anemia, airway obstruction from tumor, and heart failure from cardiac disease. Opioids are the primary medical therapy used to alleviate persistent dyspnea despite maximal medical treatment of identified causes. Other useful interventions include a trial of oxygen, cool air from a fan or open window directed at the face, repositioning, hypnosis or other relaxation techniques, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> for associated anxiety.</p><p>Based upon studies that demonstrate improvement in refractory dyspnea with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> sulfate, without development of respiratory depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>], the American College of Physicians recommends treating dyspnea in adults with short-acting opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. The studies included adult patients with cancer, chronic lung disease, and cardiac disease. Although similar data are lacking in children, we use low-dose opioid therapy in children with refractory dyspnea. A suggested starting dose for a child who has not previously received opioids is 25 to 30 percent of the dose used for pain, 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose administered orally every three to four hours as needed (maximum starting dose of 5 mg).

The underlying pathophysiology is a complex process that involves abdominal vagal afferent input, vestibular system, and two areas of the brainstem: the area postrema (referred to as the chemoreceptor trigger zone) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (referred to as the vomiting center) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70638 \">figure 1</a>). Neurotransmitters of primary importance within this process include histamine, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), and substance P (neurokinin-1 receptor). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with nausea and vomiting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and prediction of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptom management is based upon determining and eliminating the underlying cause. Medications can cause nausea, and it may be necessary to discontinue or replace them. As an example, opioids are a common source of nausea and vomiting, as they stimulate the area postrema mediated through dopamine 2 receptors and the vestibular system, and also cause constipation. Treatment includes rotation of different opioids, prevention of constipation, and the use of dopamine receptor antagonists.</p><p>In addition, therapy for nausea and vomiting includes management of electrolyte abnormalities, managing mucositis, treating constipation, and the use of antiemetic therapy, if needed. In children, several classes of antiemetic drugs are available that, in general, antagonize the neurotransmitter receptors involved in the physiology of nausea and vomiting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67210 \">table 1</a>).

It may present as loud speech, crying, increased motor activity, increased autonomic arousal (eg, diaphoresis, increased heart rate), inability to relax or concentrate, or disturbed sleep-rest pattern. Although symptoms of agitation can overlap with anxiety, they generally tend to have more motor than psychological manifestations.</p><p>Management of both delirium and agitation involves treating the underlying cause when possible. Medications that can help manage the symptoms of delirium and agitation include benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications. It is also important to rule out conditions that give the appearance of agitation, such as akathisia (an unpleasant state of motor restlessness), from antidopaminergic medications, myoclonus, withdrawal from opioids, and paradoxical reactions from medications.

As time progresses, the symptomatic benefit from a transfusion may decrease as the disease progresses, offsetting the benefit compared with the risk of transfusion related complications.</p><p>An increased risk of bleeding can occur in children with cancer due to a decrease in either platelet count or function, typically caused by an adverse effect of therapy or underlying disease. In these patients, mucosal bleeding can sometimes be controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminocaproic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aminocaproic acid</a> given orally or intravenously to inhibit fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

It requires understanding and anticipating the needs of the patient and family, and managing the social, legal, economic, and institutional circumstances that surround the child's death. Although preparing families for a child's death can be difficult, it is tremendously beneficial for families. A number of factors contribute to the quality of end-of-life care provided to children in the inpatient setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99102 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>Planning for the death of a terminally ill child requires an honest discussion of plans that will meet goals of care, identify current and future care needs, and determine what resources in the community are available to meet these needs.

Palliative sedation has been used in children with the following refractory symptoms: agitation, pain, respiratory distress, and myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p>Benzodiazepines or barbiturates are typically used as palliative sedatives, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> has also been reported to be effective in dying children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>]. Pain and palliative pediatric care experts are generally consulted to assure that all methods for symptom control have been considered, and to assist when palliative sedation is being considered. Further discussion on palliative sedation is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-sedation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative sedation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Artificial nutrition and hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most difficult aspects of the management of terminally ill patients is the decision of whether to initiate artificial nutrition or hydration (ANH) when patients are unable to take adequate oral nutrition or fluids. It remains uncertain whether ANH provides sufficient benefit to justify the risks of its known complications (eg, vomiting, oral and airway secretions, and edema). The symbolic significance of nutrition and the myths about dehydration and &quot;starvation&quot; can lead to initiation of ANH without an adequate assessment of its complications and potential lack of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/115-117\" class=\"abstract_t\">115-117</a>]. Forgoing oral and artificial nutrition at the end of life reduces the risk of choking, aspiration, vomiting, and dyspnea, and also results in ketosis, which is associated with a lack of appetite, sense of well-being, analgesia, and mild euphoria.</p><p>Both well-hydrated and dehydrated terminal patients experience thirst, presumably because oral factors are as important as the level of systemic hydration. Thirst can be controlled with small amounts of oral fluids and oral hygiene. Mouth dryness can be relieved with moistened swabs, ice chips, or petroleum jelly on the lips. Thus, it is rarely necessary to begin artificial hydration in terminally ill patients because of thirst. The pros and cons of administering artificial hydration in the terminally ill cancer patient are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Artificial nutrition and hydration'</a>.)</p><p>Like other medical interventions, ANH should be evaluated by weighing its benefits and complications in light of the clinical circumstances and goals of care with the parents and other family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>]. It is important that the family be ready to discuss whether it is better to initiate or forgo ANH for the child based on their understanding of the patient's quality of life and the effects of administering or withholding ANH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. If the decision is made to withhold ANH, support from the care team for the family is imperative, as there are often feelings of guilt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Location of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Planning for the death of a terminally ill child includes deciding upon the preferred location of death. Locations include the home, hospice facilities, and inpatient hospital units.</p><p>One study of 140 parents who lost a child to cancer reported planning for the location of death resulted in more home deaths compared with no planning (72 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. For children who died in the hospital, planning resulted in more deaths in the inpatient units rather than the intensive care unit, and fewer children being intubated. Parents who planned for the location of death were more likely to feel prepared for the child's death and were less likely to have preferred a different location.</p><p>Planning begins with the palliative team explaining treatment options. An important part of the planning process is involvement of the child when appropriate. When the preferred site is at home, discharge planners and social workers help arrange for a hospice service or for other resources within the community.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Hospice services</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasingly, there are hospice services that fulfill the needs of terminally ill children.

The hospice team is interdisciplinary and includes clinicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, bereavement staff, child life specialists, and mental health and complementary medicine therapists. In a retrospective survey, parents of children who received end-of-life home hospice services as part of their oncology care more often reported their child had fun (70 versus 45 percent), experienced events that added meaning to life (89 versus 63 percent), and died at home (93 versus 20 percent) compared with parents of children who died without home hospice involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) allows terminally ill children who are enrolled in a Medicaid or state Children's Health Insurance Plans (CHIP) hospice benefit to concurrently receive curative care related to their terminal health condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. </p><p>Despite the recognition that pediatric hospice services are effective in providing palliative care in the home of a dying child, there remain barriers in the provision of hospice services for terminally ill children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].

This rate is intended to cover all of the personnel, medications, equipment, and supplies that the child needs. In the United States, there may be requirements for insurance coverage, such as a life expectancy of no more than six months and an absence of life-sustaining treatments (eg, chemotherapy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unfamiliarity or discomfort with hospice care &minus; Many clinicians caring for children are unfamiliar with palliative pediatric care and hospice services.

If hospice is involved, the family should be directed to call the hospice, and a nurse will generally come to the home and pronounce the patient.</p><p>For patients who die in the hospital, the covering clinician is typically summoned to pronounce the patient. The clinician should inform that family that the child has died in a clear and compassionate manner. The clinician should also inform the family of the option to pursue autopsy, and organ or tissue donation. Family communication regarding organ donation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of the pediatric patient for potential organ donation&quot;, section on 'Family communication'</a>.)</p><p>In many areas, local regulations require that pediatric deaths be reported to the local medical examiner (coroner) who may choose to investigate the death and may perform an autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-palliative-care/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. This typically happens when the circumstances surrounding the death are uncertain. In cases where the child's death was expected, examination by the coroner is usually not necessary; however, the decision is at the discretion of the coroner. If the coroner declines the case, the family can be offered the option of pursuing a medical autopsy. Autopsy may provide important information both for the care team and family.
