A reduction in blood pressure can also occur with abrupt onset of pain relief, as may occur after intrathecal opioid administration for combined spinal epidural (CSE) labor analgesia. Hypotension is usually defined as either systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg or a reduction of &gt;20 percent from baseline.

Practice for treatment of neuraxial opioid induced pruritus varies: one contributor on this topic administers nalbuphine 2.5 to 5 mg IV in this setting, whereas the other administers naloxone 40 to 80 mcg IV, repeated in five minutes if necessary, and patient controlled intravenous naloxone when indicated for prolonged pruritus. </p><p>Other drugs that have been studied for the prevention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of opioid induced pruritus include intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, serotonin antagonists, and glucocorticoids. A systematic review of randomized trials of treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prevention of pruritus found that intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nalbuphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nalbuphine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a> were effective in the prevention of opioid induced pruritus, based on overall low quality data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Studies of the effect of serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists on opioid induced pruritus have reported conflicting results.

Severe PDPH is usually treated with an epidural blood patch. (See <a href=\"#H1928065332\" class=\"local\">'Postdural puncture headache'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) is a rare but potentially lethal complication of epidural administration of local anesthetics. Pregnant patients are at increased risk for LAST when high doses of a high concentration local anesthetic are administered. (See <a href=\"#H3695555896\" class=\"local\">'Local anesthetic systemic toxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Local anesthetic systemic toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In adequate analgesia, motor block, and high neuraxial block are complications that can be minimized by management techniques and choice of neuraxial drugs. (See <a href=\"#H4141751120\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate anesthesia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3425892288\" class=\"local\">'Motor block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1928065332\" class=\"local\">'Postdural puncture headache'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare, potentially devastating complication of neuraxial anesthesia techniques, that is more common in patients who are coagulopathic, either because of anticoagulant medication, systemic disease, or thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"#H2702273914\" class=\"local\">'Spinal epidural hematoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postpartum neuropathies usually have obstetric causes. Very rarely, neurologic complications can be the result of needle or catheter trauma, drug toxicity, spinal epidural hematoma, or infection, related to neuraxial anesthesia techniques. (See <a href=\"#H1979800505\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Strict aseptic technique should be followed during neuraxial anesthesia techniques, to reduce the risk of meningitis and epidural abscess, which are rare, serious complications. (See <a href=\"#H109094585\" class=\"local\">'Severe infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial analgesia can affect the fetus directly by placental transfer of local anesthetic or opioids, or indirectly via maternal effects (ie, hypotension or uterine hypertonus). Placental transfer of drugs is rare with low-dose epidural or spinal drug administration. (See <a href=\"#H2294090447\" class=\"local\">'Placental perfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of hypotension, fetal bradycardia may occur with abrupt onset of analgesia, and is more common after intrathecal opioid administration for labor analgesia than after initiation of epidural analgesia. Fetal bradycardia in this setting is transient, and when treated with usual measures, does not increase the risk of cesarean delivery or adverse neonatal outcomes. Treatment of fetal bradycardia after initiation of labor analgesia should be treated as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Discontinue intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Place the parturient in the lateral decubitus position to relieve aortocaval compression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Administer supplemental oxygen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Correct hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Fetal scalp stimulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For persistent uterine hypertonus or tachysystole, administer tocolytic medication (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> 60 to 90 mcg intravenously repeated in two to three minutes if necessary, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> 250 mcg subcutaneously if there is no response to nitroglycerin). (See <a href=\"#H1936778416\" class=\"local\">'Fetal bradycardia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low dose neuraxial labor analgesia techniques administered at any time during labor do not increase the risk of cesarean delivery or instrumental delivery. Neuraxial analgesia may shorten the first stage of labor, and may prolong the second stage of labor to a variable degree. (See <a href=\"#H100840725\" class=\"local\">'Effects on the progress and outcome of labor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial labor analgesia is unlikely to affect breastfeeding, though existing literature is insufficient to confirm this conclusion. (See <a href=\"#H1165903124\" class=\"local\">'Effects on breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of maternal hypotension prior to delivery, neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia do not negatively affect the neonate.
