The two forms are caused by different strains of variola virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3104273\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, smallpox was endemic. The illness was described in Asia during the first century AD, in Europe and Africa around 700 AD, and in Central, South, and North America during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. </p><p>Endemic variola major was eradicated from the United States in 1926 and variola minor during the 1940s. Eradication was slower in Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas. The last naturally occurring smallpox infection occurred in Somalia in October 1977 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The last known case in the world, in September 1978, resulted from a laboratory accident in Birmingham, England.</p><p>In temperate climates, endemic smallpox occurred in winter and spring and was mainly a disease of children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There was less seasonal variability in tropical climates, where there were fewer fluctuations in temperature and humidity. However, in regions that had distinct hot (high humidity) and cool (low humidity) seasons, the incidence of smallpox was always much higher in the cool, dry season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2770716\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory viral shedding and infectivity was highest at the beginning of the rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, transmission was not widespread and was usually confined to unimmunized persons sharing living quarters. Among unvaccinated family members, approximately 58 percent contracted smallpox compared with 4 percent in vaccinees. The severity of the illness, which usually confined the patient to bed and restricted contact, may have contributed to the relatively low attack rate. Because of long incubation times, transmission intervals were two to three weeks apart; thus, new cases of smallpox would appear in a community over many months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3104395\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variola virus is an orthopoxvirus within the Poxviridae family. Other poxviruses that infect humans include molluscum contagiosum, vaccinia (the virus used in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smallpox-vaccine-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">smallpox vaccine</a>), and monkeypox [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monkeypox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monkeypox&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molluscum-contagiosum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molluscum contagiosum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Variola virus is a large (200 to 400 nm) DNA virus that lacks icosahedral symmetry, unlike most other DNA viruses. The virus has a complex structure with an outer membrane, two lateral bodies, and a dumbbell-shaped core that contains a single molecule of double-stranded DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The entire 186,000 base pair genome has been sequenced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The majority of the genes are closely related to the genes of vaccinia virus, the virus used to vaccinate against smallpox [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In the 1800s a milder form of smallpox was recognized in the Americas, which was later identified as variola minor. Sequencing of the virus clearly indicated it was a different strain of variola virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While variola minor strains have high sequence similarity to variola major strains, it is believed that changes in differential gene expression may explain the differences in virulence. However, because of their high sequence similarity, it is difficult to distinguish variola minor from variola major in the laboratory. Newer diagnostic tests under development may differentiate the two strains of virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expectoration of upper airway secretions, including secretions from the oropharynx, led to person-to-person transmission of smallpox virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. Inhaled secretions containing variola virus entered the respiratory tract where viruses multiplied locally and then spread to regional lymph nodes via circulating macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Multiplication within lymph nodes then led to a primary viremia with dissemination of virus to lymphoid organs, such as the spleen. Viral amplification within lymphoid organs led to a secondary viremia, which was associated with the onset of symptoms and the characteristic smallpox rash. Virus could be isolated from the oropharynx, skin lesions, bone marrow, spleen, liver, and kidneys.</p><p>Virus that localized within small dermal blood vessels produced endothelial swelling and infection of epidermal cells, resulting in characteristic vesicles in skin and mucous membranes. When stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the cytoplasm of infected cells contained characteristic inclusions, called Guarnieri bodies, which were faintly basophilic or acidophilic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59400\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59400 \">picture 1</a>). Extension of infection into the corium and sebaceous glands produced the &quot;pockmarks&quot; or scars which, upon healing, were hallmarks of prior smallpox infection.</p><p>Variola virus infection stimulated specific cytotoxic T cell responses, neutralizing antibodies, and the production of interferons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These immune responses restricted viral replication and induced prolonged immunity in the patients who recovered. In one study, survivors had evidence of variola virus-specific CD4+ memory T-cell lymphoproliferative responses and neutralizing antibodies greater than 40 years after infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, smallpox occurred in two forms: variola major, which was a serious illness with a mortality rate of 30 to 50 percent in unvaccinated persons, and variola minor, which was a milder infection with a mortality rate of less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In general, smallpox was most severe in infants, the elderly, and in the impaired host, particularly those with T cell deficits. Milder forms of infection were observed in patients with a history of smallpox immunization. </p><p>Variola major is classified into five clinical categories, each associated with a different level of severity of disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ordinary type</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modified type</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flat type</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhagic type</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variola sine eruptione</p><p/><p>All of these forms have a characteristic rash except for variola sine eruptione. The following descriptions refer to observations in the past before smallpox was eradicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ordinary type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a typical case of ordinary type smallpox, the incubation period was 10 to 14 days (range 7 to 19 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A pre-eruptive phase, lasting two to four days, was characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, backache, and malaise. Vomiting occurred in 50 percent and diarrhea in 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>More than 70 percent of smallpox cases were of the &quot;ordinary type,&quot; which was further subdivided into three categories according to the type of rash (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61772\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61772 \">picture 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confluent rash present on face and forearms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semi-confluent rash present on the face with discrete rash elsewhere</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discrete rash on all involved areas with normal skin between pustules</p><p/><p>The clinical outcome for ordinary type smallpox was closely linked to the type of accompanying rash. For example, in unvaccinated patients, mortality was 62 percent for confluent infection, 37 percent for semi-confluent, and 9 percent for discrete rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Death from smallpox was secondary to coagulopathy, hypotension and multiorgan failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The eruptive phase was characterized by lesions on the mucous membranes (enanthem) followed approximately 24 hours later by the cutaneous rash (exanthem). Intraoral lesions first appeared as papules followed by vesicles on the tongue and palate. The spread of the exanthem was centrifugal, involving initially the face, followed by proximal extremities, the trunk, and the distal extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The exanthem began as small macules (&quot;herald spots&quot;) on the face. Macules evolved to papules by day two of the rash, vesicles by days four to five, and pustules by day seven. Fever occasionally recurred during the pustular phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The number of lesions ranged from few to thousands. Classic lesions were described as deep-seated, firm, round, and well-circumscribed vesicles or nodules. Crusts developed by day 14 and healed with residual depigmentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Modified type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modified form of smallpox was similar to ordinary disease except that the phases of the rash developed more rapidly and pustular lesions were smaller. Modified smallpox was common in vaccinated patients who became infected despite immunization and in those intentionally infected by variolation, a procedure that had been widely used as a method of vaccination prior to vaccinia virus vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2771052\"><span class=\"h2\">Flat type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This type of smallpox infection was characterized by pustules which remained flat and were usually confluent or semiconfluent. Flat type smallpox occurred mainly in children and was often fatal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2771028\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhagic type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this rare form of smallpox, skin lesions and mucous membranes became hemorrhagic. Profound prostration, heart failure, diffuse bleeding, and bone marrow suppression commonly resulted in a fatal outcome within three to four days, earning the name &quot;sledgehammer smallpox.&quot; Pregnant women were predisposed to this type of smallpox. However, hemorrhagic smallpox was difficult to recognize unless the patient had a known exposure to a patient with smallpox [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A study in non-human primates has suggested that secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the development of hemorrhagic type smallpox [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2771573\"><span class=\"h2\">Variola sine eruptione</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After exposure to variola virus, variola sine eruptione occurred among vaccinated individuals or in partially immune patients who had been previously infected. These patients had fever but no rash. A rise in anti-variola antibody titers at a time after the fever would indicate that such patients had been infected with variola virus, but did not develop a rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3857051\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific laboratory findings included granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytosis, which were common during the prodromal and early rash phase.
