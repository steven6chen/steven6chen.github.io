When dermatologic lesions arise in patients being treated for cancer, they may represent a side effect of therapy, but other etiologies need to be considered. These include a cutaneous reaction to other drugs, exacerbation of a previously existing condition, infection, metastatic tumor involvement, a paraneoplastic phenomenon, graft-versus-host disease, or a nutritional disorder.</p><p>Accurate diagnosis and management of chemotherapy-related side effects require the clinician to be knowledgeable of the most commonly reported cutaneous reaction patterns for the drugs the patient is receiving. The clinician must also be familiar with the cutaneous manifestations of certain cancers, as well as the dermatologic effects of other forms of cancer treatments. In some cases, diagnostic uncertainty can only be clarified with a rechallenge, and the clinician must determine whether rechallenge is safe and medically justifiable.</p><p>The cutaneous adverse effects of conventional cytotoxic cancer therapy agents are presented here.

It is often associated with a hyperpigmentation reaction that may affect the skin diffusely or locally (in sun-exposed areas), in a serpentine manner (a pigmentary pattern that follows an underlying vein proximal to an infusion site), darken the nail beds, and induce mucosal pigmentation of the tongue and conjunctiva. Topical fluorouracil can induce hyperpigmentation in treated areas. The fluorouracil derivative tegafur can induce well-circumscribed, brown to black, macular pigmentation that appears on the palms, soles, nails, and glans penis; the localization in these cases is unexplained. Hyperpigmentation associated with fluorouracil usually resolves within weeks to several months after cessation of therapy; however, in certain cases, nail hyperpigmentation may persist for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other drugs</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Diffuse reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, many systemic medications induce pigmentary reaction patterns that affect the skin in a diffuse manner.

Features that can help to distinguish cutaneous busulfan toxicity from true Addison's disease include normal levels of melanocyte-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

Additional dermal changes include fibrosis, vasodilatation, and atypical fibroblasts. Many of these findings mimic the histologic findings of acute, severe sunburn or radiation dermatitis.</p><p>RRD typically occurs with the first dose of the chemotherapy agent or combination.

Since the target of the radiation beam is typically located deep within the body, enhanced skin toxicity is usually not a significant problem. Skin toxicity is seen more commonly with more superficial radiation fields.

Similar to RRD, the eruption usually localizes to the irradiated field, but there may be local extension to unirradiated areas. Histologically, epidermal dysplasia, necrotic keratinocytes, and a mixed inflammatory reaction characterize involved areas, with some cases showing psoriasiform dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Susceptibility to this effect decreases as the time between administration of chemotherapy and radiation therapy lengthens.

The pathologic differential diagnosis includes graft-versus-host disease (GVHD, in the appropriate clinical setting) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). The distinction of HFS from GVHD and SJS is important since the treatments are distinct. Unfortunately, a biopsy may not be able to distinguish between these entities in a clinically relevant timeframe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Skin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H61178230\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Histopathology'</a>.) </p><p>The pathogenesis of HFS is not well understood. A direct toxic effect of the chemotherapeutic agent on eccrine coils (which are in highest density on the palms and soles) is most often proposed, although there is no direct evidence to support this theory, and microscopic evidence of damage to the eccrine sweat glands or ducts is only infrequently reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>].</p><p>Others suggest that HFS represents a mild form of acute GVHD, although evidence to substantiate this viewpoint is lacking.

Finally, the occasional co-occurrence of facial <span class=\"nowrap\">erythema/edema,</span> papular rash, and fever has led some to view this as a type I (immunoglobulin E [IgE]-mediated) allergic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>For patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>, at least some data suggest that expression of the capecitabine-activating enzyme thymidine phosphorylase is significantly greater in the skin of the palms as compared with skin on the lower back, providing higher tissue levels of the active moiety to this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Furthermore, the proliferative rate of epidermal basal cells in the palm was also higher as compared with skin from the back, suggesting that palmar skin might be more sensitive to the local action of cytotoxic drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for HFS is drug interruption or dose modification.

There are usually no long-term sequelae, although palmoplantar keratoderma may develop as a result of long-standing HFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. </p><p>For patients who develop severe (grade 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73474 \">table 6</a>)) HFS, subsequent chemotherapy doses should be reduced to avoid recurrence.

The topical urea cream is applied to hands and feet three times per day and should be reapplied after washing hands. At low concentrations (2 to 10%), topical urea acts as a humectant that increases the hydration of the stratum corneum and is generally well tolerated.
