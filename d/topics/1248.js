In the United States, it is estimated that there is a 5 to 10 percent lifetime risk for women undergoing surgery for a suspected ovarian neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Adnexal masses may be found in females of all ages, fetuses to the elderly, and there is a wide variety of types of masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713 \">table 1</a>). The principal goals of the evaluation are to address acute conditions (eg, ectopic pregnancy) and to determine whether a mass is malignant. </p><p>The initial approach to and an overview of the evaluation of patients with an adnexal mass are reviewed here.

The reported prevalence varies widely depending upon the population studied and the criteria employed. In a random sample of 335 asymptomatic women aged 25 to 40 years, the prevalence of an adnexal lesion on ultrasound examination was 7.8 percent (prevalence of ovarian cysts 6.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another series, transvaginal ultrasonography was performed on 8794 asymptomatic postmenopausal women as part of their routine gynecological check-up and 2.5 percent had a simple unilocular adnexal cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A study of 33,739 women in the University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening Program showed similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A study of over 600 women showed the distribution of histologic types of adnexal masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109383 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3883656\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the evaluation of a patient with an adnexal mass is to determine the most likely etiology of the mass. This process is often challenging, since there are many types of adnexal masses and a definitive diagnosis often requires surgical evaluation. </p><p>The evaluation is guided in large part by the anatomic location of the mass and age and reproductive status of the patient. As an example, a solid ovarian mass in a postmenopausal woman raises a high suspicion of ovarian cancer. Alternatively, a fallopian tube mass accompanied by pain and bleeding in a woman of reproductive-age requires immediate pregnancy testing and exclusion of an ectopic pregnancy. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11757752\"><span class=\"h2\">Excluding urgent conditions or malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An adnexal mass may represent a serious health issue, a condition that requires urgent intervention (eg, ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion) or an ovarian or fallopian tube cancer (or malignant disease metastatic for a peritoneal cancer or other primary). A general evaluation is performed initially to confirm the presence of a mass and to identify patients who should be further evaluated for an urgent condition or for malignancy. For other patients, the general evaluation continues as the diagnostic evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H25408488\" class=\"local\">'General evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3884018\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for urgent conditions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3884375\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical features of patients with urgent conditions are fairly specific (eg, severe pain, first trimester bleeding, fever), and these represent a minority of patients. </p><p>Similarly, few patients who present with an adnexal mass will ultimately be diagnosed with a malignancy. However, many patients will need to undergo an evaluation to fully exclude malignancy, which may require follow-up with pelvic ultrasound for a prolonged period of time or surgical exploration. This is because malignancy must be excluded for any mass that is not clearly benign, including most complex masses (characterized on ultrasound by solid components, thick walls, septations, or other hyperechoic findings). </p><p>The remaining patients include those with a simple ovarian cyst (characterized on ultrasound by an anechoic fluid filling the cyst cavity with thin walls), ovarian masses for which the ultrasound diagnosis is fairly certain (teratoma, endometrioma, hemorrhagic cyst), or other adnexal masses that are invariably benign (eg, paratubal or paraovarian cyst, broad ligament leiomyoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2727391\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic location helps to narrow the differential diagnosis.

However, when an adnexal mass is found in this patient population, there is a significant likelihood of adnexal torsion or an ovarian malignancy (approximately 10 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Germ cell tumors are the most common type of ovarian cancer in children and adolescents, comprising 35 percent compared with 20 percent in adults. The approach to adnexal masses in this age group is discussed in detail separately.

This is because the pathogenesis of many benign adnexal masses is associated with reproductive function. Pregnancy-related etiologies occur exclusively in reproductive-age patients by definition. Many other types of adnexal masses are associated with the menstrual cycle or reproductive hormones (eg, follicular cysts, endometriomas) and are common findings found in this patient population.

Patients should be assessed for features that indicate immediate intervention or suggest malignancy, and these patients should undergo a focused evaluation for these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H3884018\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for urgent conditions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3884375\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25412815\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic pain or pressure is the most common symptom associated with an adnexal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some women present with genital tract bleeding. Ovarian cancer may be associated with pelvic or abdominal symptoms or, for particular histologic types (eg, sex cord-stromal tumors), with symptoms related to hormone production by the tumor. </p><p>Patients who present with symptoms or findings suggestive of an adnexal mass should undergo pelvic examination and imaging to confirm whether a mass is present (see <a href=\"#H25412823\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3883756\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below). </p><p>For patient with a known adnexal mass, the clinician should inquire about associated symptoms. Symptom patterns that suggest a particular etiology help to guide further evaluation or management. </p><p>If pain or pressure is present, the characteristics of the discomfort should be elicited, including the acuity of onset, location, duration, whether it is constant or intermittent, and whether it is associated with any other factors (eg, menstrual cycle). An adnexal mass that is associated with severe pain, particularly of abrupt onset, or pelvic pain in a pregnant woman requires immediate evaluation. The relationship of pain symptoms to particular types of adnexal masses is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3884018\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for urgent conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>Benign masses that do not require immediate intervention may also present with pelvic pain. Ovarian physiologic cysts or neoplasms are typically associated with a dull, achy pain that is usually localized to the side of the mass or may be asymptomatic, as noted above. An endometrioma may be associated with dysmenorrhea or dyspareunia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Functional or corpus luteal cysts'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Benign neoplasms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2622939357\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Patient presentation'</a>.)</p><p>A patient who presents with an adnexal mass and vaginal bleeding and who may be pregnant should have pregnancy testing. Types of adnexal masses that are particular to pregnancy are an ectopic pregnancy, which requires urgent intervention, or a corpus luteum cyst. (See <a href=\"#H5378314\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8778632\" class=\"local\">'First trimester bleeding or pain'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should be asked about a history of fever or vaginal discharge. Patients who complain of fever and vaginal discharge and are found to have an adnexal mass should be evaluated for a tuboovarian abscess. The combination of a tubal mass and a history of pelvic inflammatory disease may also represent a hydrosalpinx. Persistent serosanguineous vaginal discharge without fever has been associated with fallopian tube cancer. (See <a href=\"#H8778667\" class=\"local\">'Fever'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6099199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pelvic and abdominal symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Women should also be asked about a history of infertility, since an endometrioma or hydrosalpinx may contribute to infertility. In addition, infertility is associated with an increased risk of ovarian tumors of low malignant potential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of infertility in women with endometriosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-surgery-for-female-infertility#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive surgery for female infertility&quot;, section on 'Salpingectomy before in vitro fertilization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H6092174\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Infertility'</a>.)</p><p>The medical history should include questions about risk factors and symptoms associated with ovarian or fallopian tube cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585 \">table 3</a>). In addition to other risk factors, age and reproductive status are important factors. (See <a href=\"#H2727399\" class=\"local\">'Age and reproductive status'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3884375\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25412823\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough pelvic examination is performed to assess for an adnexal mass in a symptomatic patient and determine its characteristics. The approaches to the pelvic examination in adults and in children are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;, section on 'Pelvic examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child#H76607090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of pelvic organs'</a>.)</p><p>A finding of an adnexal mass on pelvic examination should be further evaluated with pelvic imaging. Imaging may reveal an adnexal mass, no mass, or a mass that derives from another anatomic location in the genital (eg, uterine leiomyoma), gastrointestinal (eg, mucocele of the appendix), or urinary (eg, urachal cyst) tracts or other sites (eg, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes). (See <a href=\"#H3883756\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>The absence of an adnexal mass on examination does not fully exclude the presence of a pelvic mass. Small adnexal masses are difficult to palpate due to the deep anatomic location of the ovary. In addition, larger masses can float out of the pelvis and be difficult to feel. Ovaries are not usually palpable in postmenopausal women, and a finding of a palpable ovary in this population should prompt pelvic imaging to assess for an ovarian or tubal neoplasm. &#160;</p><p>The size, consistency, and mobility of a mass, if present, should be noted. Features that are suggestive of malignancy include a solid mass that is irregular or fixed or is associated with posterior cul-de-sac nodularity. On the other hand, endometriomas and tuboovarian abscesses are benign lesions that may be fixed and irregular. Posterior cul-de-sac nodularity is highly suspicious for malignancy in a postmenopausal woman, but may signify endometriosis in a premenopausal woman.</p><p>Patients with an inflammatory process exhibit tenderness with palpation of the adnexal mass (eg, tuboovarian abscess). However, some patients with an ovarian neoplasm have tenderness on pelvic examination. </p><p>Rectovaginal examination is performed to allow palpation of the ovary posteriorly. A rectal mass or positive fecal occult blood testing is not usually associated with an adnexal mass. These findings should be noted, if present, and further evaluated for colorectal cancer or other conditions, as appropriate. A rectal mass is an uncommon finding in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) since direct transmural extension is rare. Infrequently, rectal bleeding may occur in cases of rectal endometriosis or clear cell or endometrioid cancers arising in endometriotic implants in the rectal wall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rectovaginal-or-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rectovaginal or bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Presacral tumors may also occur. On physical examination, a presacral mass will be posterior to the rectum, while an ovarian mass will be anterior to the rectum. The location of the mass can then be confirmed with imaging studies.</p><p>Abdominal examination includes assessment for abdominal distention and ascites <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an abdominal mass.

An adnexal mass may be found in females of all ages, fetuses to the elderly, and there is a wide variety of etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with an adnexal mass present with symptoms or physical examination findings. Pelvic pain or pressure is the most common symptom of an adnexal mass. Other potential symptoms or signs include abnormal genital tract bleeding, abdominal distension, ascites, or hirsutism. Many adnexal masses are asymptomatic and the mass is discovered as an incidental finding on pelvic imaging. (See <a href=\"#H25412815\" class=\"local\">'Medical history'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the evaluation of a patient with an adnexal mass is to determine the most likely etiology of the mass. The process of evaluation includes: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A general evaluation to confirm the presence and anatomic location of the mass and to identify any associated symptoms or physical findings. (See <a href=\"#H25408488\" class=\"local\">'General evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A focused evaluation for conditions that require immediate treatment for patients who present with first trimester bleeding, acute pain, or fever. (See <a href=\"#H3884018\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for urgent conditions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A focused evaluation to exclude malignancy if the results of the general evaluation raise the suspicion that the adnexal mass is malignant. (See <a href=\"#H3884375\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medical history includes questions regarding symptoms associated with an adnexal mass and risk factors for ovarian or fallopian tube cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585 \">table 3</a>). A thorough pelvic examination is performed to assess for an adnexal mass and determine its characteristics. Features that are suggestive of malignancy include a solid mass that is irregular or fixed or is associated with posterior cul-de-sac nodularity. On the other hand, some benign lesions may have these features. (See <a href=\"#H25412815\" class=\"local\">'Medical history'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25412823\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic ultrasound is the first line imaging study for the evaluation of an adnexal mass. Ultrasound is relatively less expensive than other imaging modalities and its diagnostic performance is similar. Use of a second imaging study after ultrasound is reasonable if a clinician cannot determine whether surgical evaluation is warranted based upon the results of ultrasound and the other components of the initial evaluation(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109384 \">table 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3883756\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation includes a pregnancy test in patients of reproductive-age and tests to evaluate for malignancy or other conditions. (See <a href=\"#H5378314\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement.
