The consequences of this include lymphoproliferative disease, manifested by lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and an increased risk of lymphoma, as well as autoimmune disease, typically involving blood cells.</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical features and diagnosis of ALPS. The epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, management, and prognosis of ALPS are discussed separately.

Patients with later disease onset often presented with autoimmune manifestations rather than lymphoproliferative disease.</p><p>ALPS due to mutations in the <em>FAS</em> gene that encodes an apoptosis-associated antigen (ALPS-FAS) is the most common and best-characterized type of ALPS, although it is nonetheless a rare condition. The following are the main consequences of perturbed lymphocyte homeostasis in ALPS-FAS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698847\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic nonmalignant lymphoproliferation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expansion and persistence of lymphocyte populations that are not eliminated through apoptosis affect the lymphoid compartment, resulting in chronic lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly with or without premature destruction of blood cells (hypersplenism), and, less frequently, hepatomegaly. The lymphoproliferation typically manifests in the first years of life in individuals with ALPS-FAS. In some individuals, splenomegaly is the predominant or only manifestation of lymphoproliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>In the French and NIH cohorts, chronic lymphadenopathy was present in 85 and 97 percent, respectively, while splenomegaly was present in approximately 95 percent in both cohorts (with 73 percent showing evidence of hypersplenism).</p><p>Lymphadenopathy tends to decrease in the second decade of life, whereas splenomegaly often does not. Furthermore, long-term follow-up has shown that resolution of lymphadenopathy is not always accompanied by significant changes in the overall expansion of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The lymphoproliferation waxes and wanes for reasons that are not entirely clear. Intercurrent viral and bacterial infections can influence lymphadenopathy, but both increased and decreased intensity of lymphoproliferative manifestations have been observed with infections, making it difficult to predict the effect of infection or to understand the mechanism responsible. The overall prognosis of lymphoproliferation is relatively good, and few individuals require long-term treatment with immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698854\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmunity is a common feature of ALPS that is seen more commonly in males than females, although it is not always present at the time of diagnosis or at the time of the most extensive lymphoproliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In both the French and NIH cohorts, there is roughly a two- to three-year delay between disease onset (lymphoproliferation) and clinically significant autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The reason for this delay is unclear but may be related to age-dependent acquisition of secondary pathogenic factors or sequential exposures to infectious agents during infancy and early childhood. Autoimmunity can be the first ALPS manifestation. In many individuals, autoantibodies can be detected before clinical evidence of autoimmune disease, and it is possible that certain patients never develop overt autoimmune disease despite the presence of autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Autoimmunity most often involves combinations of Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) is less common. Autoimmune cytopenias were present in 52 percent of patients in the French cohort, and autoimmune disease of any variety was found in 61 percent, giving a risk of overall autoimmune disease development before the age of 30 years of 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 69 percent of patients in the NIH cohort developed at least one episode of autoimmune cytopenias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Combinations of cytopenias of blood elements, concomitantly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sequentially, are typical, with AIHA and ITP as the most common combination, followed by ITP and AIN. Combination cytopenias are also referred to as Evans syndrome. The presence of Evans syndrome without significant lymphoproliferation can be consistent with ALPS, especially if elevated numbers of double-negative T (DNT) cells are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hemolytic anemia in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-neutropenia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune neutropenia'</a>.)</p><p>Autoimmune cytopenias may be difficult to distinguish from the effects of concomitant hypersplenism. Examination of blood smears for evidence of hemolysis, measurement of autoantibodies, and the degree of reticulocytosis may help in distinguishing one from the other, as well as the fact that autoimmune cytopenias often manifest clinically (eg, bleeding). This also helps in distinguishing ALPS-related ITP from idiopathic ITP, which can be experienced without significant bleeding issues.</p><p>Additional autoimmune features are seen in ALPS, often in patterns that appear to be family specific, suggesting the influence of other (background) genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. These features include glomerulonephritis, autoimmune hepatitis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, uveitis, and iridocyclitis. Autoimmunity affecting endocrine systems or joints is not common in ALPS compared with other immunodeficiency disorders.</p><p>Autoimmune manifestations also wax and wane, although experience suggests that autoimmune disease poses a lifelong risk and burden. In many patients, the occurrence of autoimmunity signifies the transition from ALPS without the need for immunosuppressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunomodulating therapy into ALPS requiring long-term <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intermittent therapy, which has a less favorable prognosis. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of patients require immunosuppressive drugs to control autoimmunity due to incomplete responses to glucocorticoids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698861\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with ALPS-FAS are at an increased risk for both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), underscoring the role of <em>FAS</em> as a tumor-suppressor gene. Lymphoma typically originates in the B cell lineage, but T cell lymphomas have also occurred. Lymphoma is not related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, based upon absence of EBV in tumor biopsies.</p><p>In an earlier study, the calculated increased risk was 14-fold and 51-fold for NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The cumulative risk of lymphoma before the age of 30 years was 15 percent in the French cohort (three cases of HL and four cases of NHL, out of a total of 90 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the NIH cohort, 18 cases of lymphoma out of a total of 150 patients were identified with a median age of detection of 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The male-to-female ratio was 3.5 to 1. Sixteen of 18 cases were of B cell origin, and 17 of 18 cases occurred in patients with mutations affecting the death domain of Fas. Using published expected cases of HL and NHL in the general population, the 16 cases of B cell lymphoma conferred a significantly increased standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 149 for HL and 61 for NHL, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Clinical experience suggests that lymphomas can occur at any age in ALPS-FAS. Distinguishing a &quot;good&quot; node from a &quot;bad&quot; node is a diagnostic challenge because of the frequent concomitant presence of benign (ie, &quot;typical&quot;) lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Important clues are B type symptoms including fever, night sweats, itching, and weight loss. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging may be helpful distinguishing &quot;good&quot; from &quot;bad&quot; nodes on the basis of presumed higher metabolic activity of malignant lymphoid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Nonmalignant lymphadenopathy varies over time, and experience suggests that PET scan results fluctuate similarly with respect to the localization of &quot;hot&quot; (chemically active) versus &quot;cold&quot; nodes. In contrast, lymphoma nodes are more likely to be persistently hot. Further data are needed to prove that PET scans are a useful routine surveillance tool, particularly considering the cost. Education of <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/families</span> as to signs and symptoms of lymphoma (ie different than &quot;typical&quot; ALPS) and routine follow-up may be as effective, but questionable nodes require biopsy and histologic evaluation.</p><p>A number of studies have looked at associations between Fas and neoplasms, including somatic mutations in solid tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. To date, there is no evidence for an increased risk for malignancies other than lymphoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698868\"><span class=\"h2\">Other findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients report skin rashes, such as urticaria and eczema, as well as less frequent manifestations, such as vasculitis, panniculitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgia,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">enteritis/enterocolitis,</span> and recurrent oral ulcers. Constitutional signs, including fever, night sweats, and weight loss, are uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698875\"><span class=\"h2\">Other ALPS genotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much less can be said with certainty with respect to the other germline ALPS genotypes (ALPS due to mutations in the genes for Fas ligand or caspase 10, ALPS-FASLG and ALPS-CASP10) since there are only a few cases.</p><p>ALPS-FASLG has features distinctly different from typical ALPS due to <em>FAS</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. ALPS-FASLG is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner. Fas-induced apoptosis is normal, although an increase in DNT cells is reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, activation-induced cell death (AICD) is diminished and, less consistently, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function is abnormal.</p><p>ALPS-CASP10 has autosomal-dominant inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The mutant CASP10 has a dominant-negative interaction with multiple death receptor pathways. Patients have a wide array of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions and a significantly increased percentage of DNT cells. One patient had recurrent noninvasive skin infections, oral aphthous ulcers, arthralgia, and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Patients with ALPS due to somatic mutations in <em>FAS</em> (ALPS-sFAS) are relatively similar to ALPS-FAS patients. However, this needs further study and longer follow-up, particularly with respect to the development of autoimmune disease and lymphoma, since most (if not all or virtually all) B cells in these patients lack the <em>FAS</em> mutation. Individuals with non-FAS forms of ALPS may also be at an increased risk for lymphoma; however, further data are needed to provide a detailed risk assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1698882\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ALPS have a variety of laboratory findings, some of which are shared with other immunologic and hematologic disorders, but others that are unique to ALPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,5,23-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,23-32</a>].</p><p>The signature laboratory abnormalities that facilitate diagnosis of ALPS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of alpha beta double-negative T (DNT) cells (in peripheral blood and tissue specimens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated levels of the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) in blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased peripheral blood levels of vitamin B12</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defective Fas-mediated apoptosis on in vitro assay</p><p/><p>In patients with ALPS, there is expansion of alpha beta DNT cells in the peripheral blood and tissues. These cells express the alpha beta T cell receptor CD3 complex (TCR) but lack both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors. Detected by flow cytometric immunophenotyping, these terminally differentiated, in vivo-activated T cells are rare in healthy individuals and other immune-mediated (lymphoproliferative) disorders. Typically, they constitute less than 2 percent of the lymphocyte pool. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow cytometry for the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>As part of the lymphoproliferative aspect of ALPS, other lymphocyte subsets are expanded as well. Immunophenotypically, these include gamma delta DNT cells, CD8+CD57+ T cells, as well as human-leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ T cells and B cells that express CD5 and lack CD27. Not all lymphocyte subsets are expanded, however, as patients show decreased numbers of CD4+CD25+ T cells and decreased numbers of CD27+ B cells. In rare patients, lymphopenia is observed instead of the typical lymphocytosis (independent of immunosuppressive therapy).</p><p>Lymph node pathology in typical cases shows paracortical expansion with <span class=\"nowrap\">immunoblasts/plasma</span> cells and DNT cells in interfollicular areas, florid follicular hyperplasia, and progressive transformation of germinal centers. Sinus histiocytosis is also occasionally observed.</p><p>Other immunologic laboratory findings that are typical and unique to ALPS include abnormal Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro and increased levels of vitamin B12, interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and Fas ligand (FasL) in <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/plasma</span> (together referred to as &quot;ALPS biomarkers&quot;). There are also increased levels of soluble CD25, CD27, CD30, but these may not be specific for ALPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1699911\" class=\"local\">'Testing and classification strategy'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional findings include increased levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the context of normal or decreased concentrations of immunoglobulin M (IgM). A wide repertoire of autoantibodies can be present and most often includes a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) test; antiplatelet, antineutrophil, antiphospholipid, antinuclear antibodies; and rheumatoid factor. Autoantibodies are typically of the IgG subclass and of high affinity, in contrast to naturally occurring autoantibodies of the same specificity that are low affinity and IgM derived.</p><p>The immune system is largely intact, as far as T cell and natural killer (NK) cell functions are concerned. B cell function, as measured by antibody responses to infections and vaccinations, is relatively preserved, with normal responses to protein antigens but reduced responses to polysaccharide antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], although this is not uniformly the case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Hematologically, Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia with reticulocytosis, dyserythropoiesis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia is observed in most patients, although often not at the time of ALPS diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1699873\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ALPS is based upon clinical findings, laboratory abnormalities including defective in vitro Fas-mediated apoptosis and presence of alpha beta double-negative T (DNT) cells, and identification of mutations in genes relevant for the Fas pathway of apoptosis including Fas, Fas ligand, and caspase 10 (<em>FAS</em>, <em>FASLG</em>, and <em>CASP10</em>).

A rough rule of thumb is that the impact is related to the potency and duration of immunosuppressive therapy. As examples, a short burst of glucocorticoids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, may not alter the DNT cell compartment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ALPS biomarkers, while drugs that are often used in ALPS therapy, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, can largely normalize laboratory values <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interfere in Fas-mediated apoptosis assays.

If the clinical condition permits discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs, the diagnostic process can be delayed until that time. Conversely, <em>FAS</em> can be sequenced if continued immunosuppressive therapy is required and there is a strong suspicion of ALPS since this test will capture the vast majority of patients with ALPS. Confirmation of ALPS-sFAS, the second most common type of ALPS, requires sorting DNT cells, which may not be feasible if the DNT cell compartment is reduced by immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1699918\"><span class=\"h2\">Inheritance and prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Germline ALPS is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait, although rare cases of compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations have been reported in patients with severe disease of early, even congenital, onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, offspring of males or females affected with germline ALPS have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition, although penetrance and expressivity vary even in family members with the same mutation. Somatic ALPS is generally not heritable, since it is restricted to hematopoietic cells.</p><p>Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk for a <em>FAS</em>, <em>FASLG</em>, or <em>CASP10</em> mutation is possible by analysis of DNA extracted from fetal cells obtained by amniocentesis at approximately 15 to 18 weeks' gestation or chorionic villus sampling at approximately 10 to 12 weeks' gestation. The disease-causing allele(s) of an affected family member must be identified before prenatal testing can be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16437637\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional testing and diagnostic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performance of the Fas-mediated apoptosis assay is suggested only after ALPS-FAS, ALPS-sFAS, ALPS-CASP10, and ALPS-FASLG have been ruled out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F96876\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96876 \">algorithm 1</a>). This is due to the complex and labor-intensive nature of the assay, which can take up several weeks of culturing. However, there is a novel Fas-mediated apoptosis assay based upon differential sensitivity of memory T cells versus na&iuml;ve T cells that can be completed in one to two days instead of several weeks and can identify patients with ALPS who have germline or somatic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-lymphoproliferative-syndrome-alps-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This assay shows promise and may precede genetic testing in the diagnostic evaluation if further studies confirm the utility of the test and it becomes available in clinical diagnostic laboratories.</p><p>A second area of investigational testing has grown out of the observation of cumulative genetic defects in ALPS patients as it pertains to the presence of somatic loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Thus, measurement of Fas surface expression on T cells, particularly DNT cells, may allow detection of LOH.

While a number of acquired viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be confused with ALPS, double-negative T (DNT) cells associated with infections predominantly express gamma delta rather than alpha beta T cell receptors (TCRs). Evans syndrome is sometimes considered a specific entity. However, it should be regarded as a descriptive term, meaning the presence of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), either concomitantly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sequentially. Even if a primary diagnosis cannot be made, Evans syndrome should be regarded as a constellation of manifestations of an underlying <span class=\"nowrap\">immunologic/hematologic</span> disorder (such as ALPS). In that context, primary immunodeficiency disorders can present with lymphoproliferation, including lymphoma, and autoimmune cytopenias.

The underlying causes of CVID are not known for most patients, although specific molecular defects are being identified in a growing subset of patients.

HIGM can be X linked (due to a defect in <em>CD40L </em>or due to NEMO syndrome) or autosomal recessive (due to defects in <em>CD40</em>, <em>AICDA</em>, or <em>UNG</em>). The shared features caused by these defects include recurrent bacterial infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonias. Autoimmune hematologic disorders, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia, are also found.
