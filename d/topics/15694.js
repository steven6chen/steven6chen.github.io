Sick sinus syndrome is caused by a problem with the heart's electrical system.</p><p>Normal heartbeats happen when an electrical signal starts in one spot near the top of the heart. This signal follows a path to spread across the heart. As it spreads, the signal makes the heart muscle squeeze. Each time the heart squeezes (&quot;beats&quot;), it pumps blood all over the body. Normally, the heart beats in a regular way 60 to 100 times a minute.</p><p>In sick sinus syndrome, there is a problem with the spot that starts the heartbeat. Heartbeats don't start often enough. As a result, the heartbeat is slower than normal. Doctors use the term &quot;bradycardia&quot; when a heartbeat is slower than normal.</p><p>Some people with sick sinus syndrome also have episodes when their heartbeat is too fast, called &quot;tachycardia.&quot;</p><p>People with sick sinus syndrome can have episodes in which a fast heartbeat quickly changes to a slow heartbeat. Because of this, doctors sometimes use the terms &quot;tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome&quot; or &quot;tachy-brady syndrome&quot; to describe sick sinus syndrome.</p><p>Different things can cause sick sinus syndrome, including heart conditions, other medical problems, and certain medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26979967\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of sick sinus syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with sick sinus syndrome have no symptoms.</p><p>When symptoms do happen, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling light-headed or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting or feeling like you are going to faint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, especially with exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain, especially with exercise or when under stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like your heart is beating fast, beating hard, or skipping beats</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26979982\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for sick sinus syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. During the exam, he or she will check your pulse and listen to your heart. He or she will do an ECG (also called &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;). An ECG measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Your doctor might also do other tests. These can help show what's causing the sick sinus syndrome and check for other problems with your heart. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A home heart monitor &ndash; This test records your heartbeat over the course of hours or days. You will need to wear or carry a heart monitor device around at home (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76605 \">figure 2</a>). The device will measure and record your heart's electrical activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An exercise stress test &ndash; During this test, the doctor will record your ECG while you exercise on a treadmill or bike (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60855 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26980060\"><span class=\"h1\">How is sick sinus syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on whether you have symptoms or not, and what's causing your sick sinus syndrome.</p><p>People who have no symptoms usually do not need treatment. But your doctor or nurse will see you for regular follow-ups to monitor your condition.</p><p>People who have symptoms usually need treatment. Treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine changes &ndash; If a medicine is causing your sick sinus syndrome, the doctor will change or stop that medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pacemaker &ndash; This is the treatment used most often for sick sinus syndrome. A pacemaker is a device that sits under the skin near a person's heart. It sends electrical signals to the heart. These signals help the heart beat at a normal rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Doctors sometimes treat sick sinus syndrome with heart medicines, but these don't usually work as well as a pacemaker.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26980075\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bradycardia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tachycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tachycardia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
