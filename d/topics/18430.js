In women who have uterine adenomyosis, the uterus gets larger than normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). This happens because the kind of cells that normally line the walls of the uterus start to grow <strong>inside</strong> the walls of the uterus. Uterine adenomyosis will be called just &quot;adenomyosis&quot; here.</p><p>Adenomyosis often happens along with other problems that affect the uterus, especially endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which the kind of cells normally found only in the uterus starts to grow outside of the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3539872\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of adenomyosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the lower belly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3539887\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have very heavy or painful periods, see your doctor or nurse. Often there are treatments that can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3539902\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. None of the tests that are available can show for sure whether you have adenomyosis. Even so, there are some tests that can help your doctor or nurse figure out what might be causing your symptoms. For example, your doctor or nurse might send you for an MRI or an ultrasound. These tests create pictures of the inside of your body. They can show whether your uterus is enlarged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3539917\"><span class=\"h1\">How is adenomyosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only proven treatment for adenomyosis is surgery to remove the uterus, called a hysterectomy. But there are other treatment options that might reduce the heavy bleeding caused by adenomyosis, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IUD &ndash; An intrauterine device (IUD) is a small device that fits inside the uterus and is normally used to prevent pregnancy. One type of IUD, which releases the hormone progestin, might help with the symptoms of adenomyosis. (IUDs must be placed in the uterus by a doctor or nurse.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial ablation &ndash; This is surgery to cause scarring in the lining of the uterus, which makes periods less heavy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine artery embolization &ndash; This is a treatment that blocks the blood supply to the uterus.</p><p/><p>Treatments that can ease the pain of adenomyosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth control pills</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">leuprolide</a> (brand names: Lupron, Eligard), which causes your ovaries to stop making the hormones estrogen and progesterone</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3539932\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, you should not have a hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, or uterine artery embolization. Instead, work with your doctor to find other treatment options until after you have your children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3539947\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heavy periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=painful-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Painful periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Endometriosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysterectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hysterectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-or-prolonged-menstrual-bleeding-menorrhagia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=painful-menstrual-periods-dysmenorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Endometriosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
