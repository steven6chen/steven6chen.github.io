These symptoms happen because the large intestine becomes inflamed and gets sores, called &quot;ulcers.&quot; The large intestine is also called the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58531 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214239036\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can be mild or severe. They might happen just once. Or they might go away and come back over and over again. Possible symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that might happen 10 or more times a day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the anus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucus coming out of the anus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling and pain in the hips and knees</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness and pain in the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcers or sores in your mouth</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214239043\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for ulcerative colitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are a few tests that can help doctors diagnose ulcerative colitis. Doctors usually use a test called a &quot;sigmoidoscopy&quot; or a similar test called a &quot;colonoscopy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>). For these tests, the doctor puts a thin tube into your rectum (the lower part of the large intestine) and threads it up into your colon. The tube has a camera attached to it, so the doctor can look inside your colon. The tube also has tools attached, so the doctor can take samples of tissue to look at under the microscope. Other tests might include X-rays or scans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214239050\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your symptoms might improve if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on foods that make your symptoms worse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78463 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid pain medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Motrin, Advil) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (brand name: Aleve). If you need a pain medicine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) is OK to use.</p><p/><p>If you start cutting foods out of your diet, your doctor might suggest that you take a multivitamin and a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> supplement. If you stop eating dairy, you should take calcium and vitamin D. These supplements will make up for nutrients you might be missing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214239057\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ulcerative colitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on your symptoms, your doctor might prescribe:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that you put directly into your rectum. These reduce swelling in mild cases. It takes about 3 to 4 weeks before they start working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that you take in a pill. A common one is called &quot;5-ASA.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brief course of medicines called steroids to reduce swelling. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stronger medicines for severe cases. These medicines work on your immune system to protect your colon from damage. Common ones are &quot;6-mercaptopurine,&quot; &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">azathioprine</a>,&quot; and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) medicines such as &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">infliximab</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">adalimumab</a>.&quot;</p><p/><p>For most people, symptoms go away after just a few weeks of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214239064\"><span class=\"h1\">Is surgery an option?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When medicines and changes in diet don't work, surgery can help. There are 2 types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the colon, rectum, and anus. People who have this surgery can no longer have bowel movements in the normal way. Instead, their bowel movements come out through a hole in their belly. A plastic bag catches the waste.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove just the colon and rectum. After this surgery, the doctor reconnects the small intestine to the anus. People who have this surgery can have bowel movements in the normal way.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214239071\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, ulcerative colitis does not affect a woman's ability to get pregnant. If you want to have a baby, talk to your doctor or nurse before you start trying to get pregnant. He or she can make sure you get all the tests you need before and during your pregnancy. It is important for ulcerative colitis to be properly treated during pregnancy. Your doctor or nurse might want to switch your medicines. That's because some of the medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis might not be safe for a baby. Your doctor might also want to put you on a higher dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> than women without ulcerative colitis need.</p><p>Conditions like ulcerative colitis run in families. So, if you have a child, he or she might get it, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214239078\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bloody stools (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colostomy-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colostomy care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Inflammatory bowel disease and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-and-the-5-aminosalicylates-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sulfasalazine and the 5-aminosalicylates (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
