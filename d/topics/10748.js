They increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes. Preventative strategies and treatments are available and should be used when appropriate.</p><p>The major medical complications associated with stroke will be reviewed here; cardiac and pulmonary complications of stroke are discussed in greater detail separately.

In a prospective study that analyzed the placebo group of the Randomized Trial of Tirilazad Mesylate in Acute Stroke (RANTTAS) database (n = 279), at least one medical complication occurred in 95 percent of patients, and at least one serious medical complication (defined as prolonged, immediately life threatening, or resulting in hospitalization or death) occurred in 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common serious medical complications were pneumonia (5 percent), gastrointestinal bleeding (3 percent), congestive heart failure (3 percent), and cardiac arrest (2 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68148 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>In another report of 489 patients with acute stroke, most patients (64 percent) experienced one or more complications within the first week after stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Incidence rates vary across studies but improving care may be reducing complication rates. In one prospective longitudinal study, the frequency of one or more medical complications within the first week after stroke declined from 2003 to 2013 by 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The presence of any in-hospital medical complication, many of which are preventable, has been associated with a significantly increased risk for 30-day readmission (adjusted hazard ratio 1.68; 95% CI 1.04-2.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of deaths after stroke are attributed to medical complications. Prospectively collected data suggest that direct effects of ischemic stroke account for the majority of deaths within the first week after stroke, but medical complications predominately account for the mortality thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. In support of these observations, an autopsy series found that the most common cause of death after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke was cerebrovascular disease in the first week, pulmonary embolism in the second through fourth weeks, bronchopneumonia in the second and third months, and cardiac disease after three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Furthermore, a single-center prospective study found that patients who experienced in-hospital medical complications after acute ischemic stroke had significantly higher mortality rates even four years after stroke onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Older age, atrial fibrillation, and greater disability at discharge were associated with increased mortality after one year in survivors.</p><p>Good general care should be directed at maintaining vital cardiopulmonary function. Measures to prevent subacute complications of stroke (aspiration, malnutrition, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, orthopedic complications, and contractures) are recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51491951\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIAC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and neurogenic cardiac injury are potential complications of acute stroke. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes often occur in the setting of stroke, likely mediated by the autonomic nervous system. These problems are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-complications-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac complications of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51491982\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious pulmonary complications of stroke are pneumonia, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia is the most common cause of fever within the first 48 hours of acute stroke. Aspiration is the cause of about 60 percent of poststroke pneumonia, and it is usually due to stroke-related dysphagia or to decreased level of consciousness. These problems are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stroke-related pulmonary complications and abnormal respiratory patterns&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51492085\"><span class=\"h1\">DYSPHAGIA AND ASPIRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysphagia is a common complication of stroke and is a major risk factor for developing aspiration pneumonia. Dysphagia related to stroke is more precisely characterized as oropharyngeal dysphagia, defined by swallowing impairment of the upper digestive tract. This definition has been extended to capture impairments in swallowing efficiency and safety, including delays in the timing of movements, reduced range of movements, and frank aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Aspiration in this population is usually a sign of severe dysphagia, and refers to abnormal entry of fluid, particulate exogenous substances, or endogenous secretions into the airways.</p><p>These observations are supported by a systematic review of 24 studies that evaluated oropharyngeal dysphagia and aspiration in adult patients with stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In pooled analysis of the small number of studies with sufficient data, dysphagia was associated with a significantly increased risk of pneumonia compared with no dysphagia (relative risk [RR] 3.17, 95% CI 2.07-4.87), and aspiration was also associated with an increased risk of pneumonia compared with no aspiration (RR 11.56, 95% CI 3.36-39.77).</p><p>The incidence of dysphagia after stroke was lowest when identified by screening methods, mainly water swallow (37 to 45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence was intermediate when identified by a trained swallowing clinician (51 to 55 percent), and it was highest when identified by instrumental testing, mainly videofluoroscopy (64 to 78 percent). The dysphagia rates may have been overestimated by instrumental testing, which can reveal movement patterns that reflect the normal effects of aging; these were not distinguished from pathologic dysphagia by the definitions used in the studies.</p><p>Independent predictors of dysphagia on initial presentation include male gender, age greater than 70, disabling stroke, impaired pharyngeal response, incomplete oral clearance, and palatal weakness or asymmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Bedside tests to screen for swallowing dysfunction are useful but are not completely accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One study found that the best bedside predictors of aspiration to thin liquid were spontaneous cough during test swallows and the overall sense of the presence of aspiration by the examiner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A 2012 systematic review found that cough or voice change in response to bedside water swallow test had a low to moderate sensitivity and moderate to high specificity for predicting aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>It is important to assess patients for their swallowing function prior to administering oral medications or food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], despite the lower sensitivity of screening tests compared with more comprehensive testing. In a prospective, multicenter study, use of a formal screening protocol for dysphagia (eg, water swallow test) for all patients admitted with stroke was associated with a significantly decreased risk of aspiration pneumonia compared with no formal screen (adjusted odds ratio 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The pneumonia rates at sites with and without a formal dysphagia screen were 2.4 versus 5.4 percent, for an absolute risk reduction of 3 percent.</p><p>Prevention of aspiration in patients with acute stroke includes initial nil per os (NPO) status for those who may be at risk for aspiration and subsequent dietary modifications for those who have persistent dysphagia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, which is potentially life-threatening. The risk of VTE is elevated in the first one to three months after stroke, due in part to stroke-related immobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Pulmonary embolism, often unassociated with clinically recognized DVT, accounts for 13 to 25 percent of early deaths after stroke and is the most common cause of death at its peak occurrence about two to four weeks after stroke onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The incidence of pulmonary embolism in the first few months after stroke ranges from 1 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/1,2,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,20,21</a>]. The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Proximal DVT is a serious problem for patients with stroke because it may lead to life-threatening pulmonary embolism. The overall prevalence of clinically evident DVT after acute stroke is 1 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/20,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-25</a>]. The prevalence of asymptomatic DVT is even higher. In the largest observational report, which evaluated 5632 immobile patients with acute stroke using duplex ultrasound, DVT was detected within 10 days of enrollment in 11 percent, and within 30 days in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A smaller study using MRI in patients with acute stroke reported proximal DVT at 21 days in 18 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. DVT development may occur as early as the second day after stroke onset and has a peak incidence between two to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk of death associated with an untreated proximal DVT in patients with stroke is about 15 percent.</p><p>Patients with hemiparesis are predisposed to DVT development, and the degree of paresis confers a graded risk of DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a report that included 542 patients with DVT and a weak leg, the DVT was ipsilateral to the weak leg in 73 percent, contralateral in 11 percent, and bilateral in 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, the presence of a DVT on the nonparetic side suggests the presence of DVT on the paretic side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Additional important risk factors for DVT include advanced age, high stroke severity, and immobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>].</p><p>In most circumstances, compression ultrasonography is the noninvasive test of choice for the diagnosis of patients with suspected DVT. The evaluation of patients with suspected DVT is discussed separately.

VTE prophylaxis in patients with acute or prior intracerebral hemorrhage is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-an-acute-or-prior-intracerebral-hemorrhage#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with an acute or prior intracerebral hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Based upon the evidence presented below, we recommend VTE prophylaxis with thigh-length intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), starting at presentation, for patients within 72 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset who have restricted mobility. Contraindications to IPC include leg ischemia caused by peripheral vascular disease, leg ulcerations, dermatitis, and severe leg edema. IPC should not be started for patients who have already been at bed rest or immobilized without any form of VTE prophylaxis for &gt;72 hours since stroke onset because of the theoretical risk of dislodging a venous clot.</p><p>In addition to IPC, we suggest additional VTE prophylaxis with anticoagulation, starting at presentation for patients within 48 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset who have restricted mobility, using either subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> 40 mg daily) or subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (5000 units two to three times daily). This recommendation applies only to patients for whom the assessed benefit of anticoagulation is thought to outweigh the risk of bleeding. Note that anticoagulants should not be used for 24 hours after the administration of thrombolytic therapy, though their use during this time interval has not been rigorously evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-thrombolytic-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke-therapeutic-use#H550924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke: Therapeutic use&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal duration of VTE prophylaxis is uncertain, as the clinical trials have generally employed prophylaxis for two weeks, and longer periods of treatment are not well studied in patients with stroke. A subgroup analysis of one randomized trial suggested that longer-term prophylaxis (eg, up to six weeks) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> reduced the risk of VTE and increased the risk of major bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The 2012 ACCP guidelines state that VTE prophylaxis should be initiated as early as possible and be continued during hospitalization or until the patient regains mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90846593\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermittent pneumatic compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is effective for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention in immobilized patients with acute stroke and has few clinically important side effects. Supporting evidence comes from the open-label multicenter CLOTS 3 trial, which randomly assigned over 2800 immobile patients within the first three days of admission for acute stroke to treatment with thigh-length IPC or no IPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Treatment was continued for at least 30 days or until the patient regained mobility, was discharged from the hospital, or could not tolerate continuation; the median duration was 9 days. At 30 days, there was a significant reduction in the rate of DVT in the femoral or popliteal veins (ie, proximal DVT) for the IPC compared with the no IPC group (8.5 versus 12.1 percent, absolute risk reduction 3.6 percent, 95% CI 1.4-5.8; adjusted odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.84). In addition, the IPC group had significantly lower rates of symptomatic DVT (proximal or calf veins) and any DVT (symptomatic or asymptomatic, proximal or calf). No major adverse events were associated with IPC treatment, but the IPC group had a significantly higher rate of skin breaks (3.1 versus 1.4 percent). Approximately one-third of patients in both groups received either anticoagulant prophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation.</p><p>The 2012 ACCP guidelines, which were published prior to the CLOTS 3 trial, had found only indirect evidence from other populations, mainly postoperative patients, showing that IPC was associated with reduction in DVT of approximately 50 percent compared with no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>].</p><p>IPC is contraindicated in those with overt evidence of leg ischemia caused by peripheral vascular disease, leg ulcerations, dermatitis, or severe leg edema. It should not be started in patients who have already been at bed rest or immobilized without VTE prophylaxis for more than 72 hours since stroke onset, since IPC may cause a newly formed clot to dislodge. Less than total compliance by patients and caregivers can also limit the effectiveness of IPC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3602579\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticoagulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective studies have established that both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are effective in reducing DVT and pulmonary embolism in patients with stroke, at the price of an increased risk of intracerebral and extracranial bleeding when compared with no anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Thus, the benefit-to-risk ratio is less certain for patients with acute ischemic stroke, who are at risk for hemorrhagic brain infarction, than for hospitalized patients without acute brain ischemia. </p><p>The following reports convey the range of observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2007 systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing early (typically within 48 hours) administration of either LMWH or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> with control (placebo or no treatment) for VTE prevention in patients with acute ischemic stroke, 16 trials published through January 2005 involving 23,043 patients met the inclusion criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, the number of outcome events was small and different doses of anticoagulant treatment were used, precluding definitive conclusions. Most of the patients (over 19,000) in the meta-analysis came from the IST study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], in which VTE was a secondary outcome.

One meta-analysis reported that unfractionated heparin (15,000 units) given in three divided doses per day was more effective for preventing DVT than heparin 10,000 units given in two divided doses per day, but there was no analysis comparing the different heparin regimens for the prevention of pulmonary embolism or for the risk of major bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-complications-of-stroke/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Pneumonia is the most common cause of fever within the first 48 hours of acute stroke. Aspiration is the cause of about two-thirds of poststroke pneumonia, and it is usually due to stroke-related dysphagia or to decreased level of consciousness. These problems are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stroke-related pulmonary complications and abnormal respiratory patterns&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend assessment of swallowing function for all patients admitted with acute stroke prior to administering oral medications or food (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest use of a formal screening protocol for dysphagia for all patients admitted with stroke (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Prevention of aspiration in patients with dysphagia includes initial nil per os (NPO) status for those who may be at risk for aspiration and subsequent dietary modifications for those who have persistent dysphagia.

In addition to IPC, for patients within 48 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset who have restricted mobility, we suggest low-dose anticoagulant therapy, starting at presentation, using either low molecular weight heparin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, rather than no prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This recommendation applies only to patients for whom the assessed benefit of VTE prophylaxis is thought to outweigh the risk of bleeding. Reasonable regimens include subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> 40 mg once daily or subcutaneous heparin 5000 units two times to three times daily. Anticoagulants should not be used for 24 hours after the administration of thrombolytic therapy.

Risk factors include older age, severe stroke, and a history of peptic ulcer disease or cancer predating the incident stroke. GI stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 antagonists is not used routinely for patients with acute stroke, but is reserved for select patients who need intensive care unit management. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest assessment of baseline nutritional status and measures to correct any major nutritional problems in patients with acute ischemic stroke (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
