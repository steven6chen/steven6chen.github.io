FAODs lead to deficient energy production and produce widely variable clinical presentations ranging from mild hypotonia in adults to sudden death in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical features, diagnosis, and general treatment approach for FAODs. The specific disorders are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific fatty acid oxidation disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3996578997\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated incidence of FAODs is approximately one in every 5000 to 10,000 live births (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114663 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common FAOD is medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), with a prevalence of 1 in 20,000. These autosomal recessive disorders are seen in both males and females in all ethnic populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H879518819\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF FATTY ACID OXIDATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatty acid beta-oxidation takes place in the mitochondria and provides a major source of energy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59178 \">figure 1</a>). There are at least 31 enzymes or carriers that participate in FAO. While short- and medium-chain fatty acids, typically &lt;10 carbon units, can enter the mitochondria directly, longer-chain fatty acids &gt;12 carbon units are transported by way of a carnitine shuttle cycle. Within mitochondria, the beta-oxidation cycle forms two-carbon acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH<sup>+</sup>) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH<sub>2</sub>), which in turn are transferred to the respiratory chain for oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Acetyl-CoA is used as a substrate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce additional reducing equivalents for the electron transport chain and for ketone body and cholesterol synthesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3747121906\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FAODs are autosomal recessive disorders that are fundamentally diseases of energy deficiency. Deranged FAO leads to a triple defect in energy production. First, there is a direct decrease of reducing equivalents for oxidative phosphorylation produced directly by enzymatic reaction of FAO. Second, there is reduced production of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle substrate acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), leading to further reduction of reducing equivalents. Finally, there is a reduction in the production of ketone bodies, a key alternative fuel for brain, heart, muscle, kidney, and other tissues during stress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2650938646\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FAODs can present at any age, with the most severe forms, such as the long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs), presenting in the first few days of life, while medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) usually presents in early childhood. Common presenting signs include hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, liver disease and liver failure, cardiac and skeletal myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and retinal degeneration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114663 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some patients may present with a Reye-like syndrome. Life-threatening presentations may rapidly occur with minimal fasting in infants but may require 24 to 48 hours of fasting in older individuals. In the most severe forms, death may occur prior to receipt of newborn screening (NBS) results. The accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitine species may be dysrhythmogenic and is associated with cardiac dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].<strong> </strong>Patients with FAODs do not exhibit chronic central nervous system effects unless a severe episode(s) of hypoglycemia or hyperammonemia has previously caused acute, permanent damage. Disease-specific manifestations are reviewed in the topic on individual disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific fatty acid oxidation disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361720687\"><span class=\"h2\">Carriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carriers are typically asymptomatic, although mild biochemical abnormalities may be present. Female carriers of the defect for long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD) are at risk of developing acute fatty liver of pregnancy or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome when carrying an affected fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H910345743\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hypoketotic hypoglycemia have low serum glucose levels and low or absent serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels and urine ketones. Electrolytes and arterial blood gas analysis show a metabolic acidosis as the patient becomes dehydrated. Patients with liver dysfunction have elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and, during a severe crisis, may also have hyperammonemia. Creatine kinase may be elevated in the long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) with myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Patients with long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCADD) can present with laboratory and clinical features compatible with a respiratory chain disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Accumulation of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) in these patients disrupts energy mitochondrial homeostasis in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3618243062\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many developed countries, most FAODs are detected through newborn screening (NBS) by tandem mass spectrometry, but the specific disorders tested can vary significantly by country. The preferred tests to confirm a diagnosis in an infant with a positive NBS are a plasma acylcarnitine profile and total and free carnitine levels. DNA testing is the most common definitive test and can provide information on final diagnosis (eg, trifunctional protein deficiency [TFPD] versus isolated long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency [LCHADD]) and predicted phenotype. When NBS is not available, early recognition of clinical symptoms is essential and should trigger appropriate testing. Clinical findings that should prompt an evaluation for FAODs include hypoketotic hypoglycemia, Reye-like syndrome (hypoglycemia with hyperammonemia), cardiomyopathy, or recurrent rhabdomyolysis.</p><p>A false-positive NBS for an FAOD can occur in infants who are carriers for one of the disorders. Additionally, NBS identifies many milder forms of FAOD in infants with lower but still elevated concentrations of diagnostic acylcarnitine species as compared with more severe forms of FAOD. Such infants may continue to have persistent elevations of these acylcarnitines yet remain asymptomatic. Mutation analysis may help predict the risk for clinical disease in this setting. However, long-term follow-up studies are needed to more definitively determine clinical risk and the need for monitoring for later-onset symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>If variants of uncertain significance are identified on DNA sequencing, enzyme assay in leukocytes, fibroblasts, or hepatocytes may provide additional information on their functional significance. Assessment of the ability of leukocytes or skin fibroblasts to oxidize labeled fatty acids (often called an FAO probe) is available in some clinical laboratories. Urine organic acid analysis may show elevations of long-chain dicarboxylic acids in the long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) or other organic acids in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), while quantitation of urine acylglycines may show elevated hexanoylglycine in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114663 \">table 1</a>). Urinary dicarboxylic acids and other abnormal metabolites may be present during illness but not when a patient is well. Lack of urinary ketones with fasting or illness due to a defect in ketogenesis is another suggestive, but nonspecific, sign of an FAOD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2263173702\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for the FAODs reflects the various presentations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoketotic hypoglycemia</strong> &ndash; Hyperinsulinism syndromes are the primary differential in patients who present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia. These disorders can be identified by early-onset fasting hypoglycemia that occurs only a few hours postprandial, in contrast to FAODs, which typically require longer periods of fasting (eg, at least three to four hours postprandial). Hyperinsulinism syndrome can be recognized on testing, demonstrating elevated insulin levels and low free fatty acids, and therapeutic responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazoxide</a> in some cases. Confirmation of diagnosis may require DNA sequencing for the known specific genetic defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101681\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101681 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiomyopathy</strong> &ndash; Other genetic and acquired cardiomyopathies (dilated or hypertrophic) are in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop cardiomyopathy. Other inborn errors of metabolisms that can cause cardiomyopathy include Pompe disease and other glycogen and lysosomal storage diseases, mitochondrial and respiratory chain disorders, organic acidemias, and congenital disorders of glycosylation. These causes of cardiomyopathy can be recognized by additional testing including elevated plasma lactate, elevated excretion of mucopolysaccharides, abnormal urine organic acids, or carbohydrate-deficient transferrin. In addition, white blood cell alpha-glucosidase is deficient in Pompe disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lysosomal-acid-alpha-glucosidase-deficiency-pompe-disease-glycogen-storage-disease-ii-acid-maltase-deficiency#H1728246189\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency (Pompe disease, glycogen storage disease II, acid maltase deficiency)&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rhabdomyolysis</strong> &ndash; In patients who present with rhabdomyolysis, the differential should include glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), such as McArdle disease (GSD V), and other congenital and acquired myopathies. GSD V is recognized by a lack of fasting-induced hypoketotic hypoglycemia, presence of lactic acidosis, and a &quot;second wind&quot; phenomenon. Diagnosis of an FAOD can be confirmed with plasma acylcarnitine testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myophosphorylase deficiency (glycogen storage disease V, McArdle disease)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reye syndrome</strong> &ndash; Reye syndrome is a rapidly progressing encephalopathy with hepatic dysfunction. The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. Many cases are associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use in children. Other associations have included FAOD and urea cycle disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-children#H3222085568\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in children&quot;, section on 'Reye syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1662189307\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON ELEMENTS OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Features of treatment that are common to all FAODs are reviewed here. Unique treatments for specific disorders or groups of disorders are reviewed in each respective section. Treatment of FAODs involves avoidance of prolonged fasting and maintenance of a constant energy supply during times of catabolism by simple carbohydrates by mouth or intravenously (IV) if the patient is unable to maintain anabolism though oral intake. For those who cannot tolerate oral feeding, IV administration of glucose should be initiated immediately to maintain normal glucose level. The recommended diet is fat restricted and carbohydrate supplemented for most FAODs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders#H4214590437\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific fatty acid oxidation disorders&quot;, section on 'Dietary management of LCFAODs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders#H4194617364\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific fatty acid oxidation disorders&quot;, section on 'L-carnitine supplementation in LCFAODs'</a>.)</p><p>A safe fasting time differs for different age groups and increases as the child ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A neonate should fast no longer than three hours. Between 6 and 12 months, infants may fast up to four hours during the day and six to eight hours during the night. Children older than 12 months can fast four hours during the day and at least eight hours at night. If an infant is ill, especially with a fever, or is in a catabolic state due to other physiologic stresses, fasting should be limited to three to four hours with frequent monitoring for clinical symptoms. Preoperative planning for elective surgery should include limiting fasting times as above and providing IV fluids with 10 percent dextrose at 1.5 times maintenance during and after the procedure until adequate oral intake is restored.</p><p>The medication <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, commonly used for anesthesia, has been avoided in patients with mitochondrial FAODs due to concerns that it contains long-chain fatty acids and reports of severe side effects in some critically ill patients receiving high-dose propofol infusion. However, in the examination of outcomes of eight children with long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD) or trifunctional protein deficiency (TFPD), no adverse side effects were observed, and propofol was safely used in short-duration procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Further research is necessary to understand the potential risks of this drug in patients with FAODs. In the meantime, it should not be used in patients with metabolic decompensation or critical illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2139689780\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient outcomes, including quality of life and survival, have improved with early detection and institution of therapy due to newborn screening (NBS) programs. However, early identification through NBS does not prevent all severe complications and death, and not all disorders are screened in all countries. In addition, available treatments do not completely eliminate disease manifestations, particularly rhabdomyolysis and cardiomyopathy. Symptoms can still be triggered by acute illness or other physiologic stress, resulting in rapid, life-threatening metabolic decompensation. Patients face a lifelong risk of recurrent symptoms and metabolic decompensation during prolonged fasting or increased metabolic stress (eg, prolonged surgery).</p><p>FAOD patients diagnosed symptomatically at less than six years of age were reported to have over 60 percent mortality for most long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) including very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD), long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD), carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 2 deficiency (CPT2D), and carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD) despite treatment at the standard of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Overall, the younger the age at diagnosis, the better the reported outcome. In another study, patients with VLCADD had a reported rate of sudden death of 52 percent and overall mortality of 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Children with inborn errors of metabolism identified through NBS versus clinical diagnosis tended to have improved outcomes, with less severe disease, fewer long-term sequelae, and higher mean intelligence quotient (IQ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. More focused studies have demonstrated reductions in severe adverse outcomes and deaths in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and LCFAOD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] with NBS. Other international, long-term outcome studies are in progress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H402725714\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of novel therapies have been proposed or investigated for FAODs. Part of the difficulty in treating long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) centers on a lack of complete understanding of the pathophysiologic effects of the deranged energy metabolism. The presence of rhabdomyolysis without hypoglycemia in older patients suggests an effect unrelated to energy deficit. Abnormal signaling from long-chain fatty acid metabolites, secondary carnitine deficiency, generalized mitochondrial dysfunction, and aberrant inflammatory responses are all possible mechanisms. Larger randomized trials, coupled with long-term clinical follow-up studies similar to those ongoing with urea cycle disorders through the <a href=\"http://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/&amp;token=3P39bFY6QkFxXEfCK67hxoRGnOBm8LNT228Hn6Y6H6p83SNBdyrTqBZtatiSNsUI&amp;TOPIC_ID=111790\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Rare Disease Consortium</a>, are needed to validate existing data and implement future therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32009700\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene transcription activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic strategy in development is activation of FAO enzyme gene transcription. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bezafibrate-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bezafibrate</a>, used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and promotes transcription of many genes encoding FAO enzymes. Reduction in episodes of rhabdomyolysis and creatine kinase levels and improvements in measures of quality of life have been reported in patients with carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 2 deficiency (CPT2D) treated with bezafibrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In studies of bezafibrate-incubated fibroblasts from very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) patients, all demonstrated increased VLCAD mRNA levels, but functional changes were more variable and appeared to be mutation specific. Cells with genotypes associated with more severe, neonatal-onset disease had no significant changes in total cellular beta-oxidation flux, whereas significant improvements in flux and VLCAD protein were seen in cells from patients with milder disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In light of these data, the proposed mechanism of action is enhanced residual activity level of the mutant enzyme rather than increased transcription of VLCAD mRNA. Patients with CPT2D or VLCADD who were treated with bezafibrate did not show improvement of clinical symptoms or FAO during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Bezafibrate treatment of carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD) led to an in vitro response in cells but failed to demonstrate any short-term clinical effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, bezafibrate treatment was reported to provide clinical improvement in a child with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) including motor and social development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Other gene transcription activation strategies are in the early stages of development. Studies of resveratrol and stilbenes have shown in vitro improvements in FAO flux in CPT2D and VLCADD fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1529060308\"><span class=\"h2\">Triheptanoin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triheptanoin is a triglyceride of three seven-carbon fatty acids that can be used as an intermediate substrate (anaplerotic) therapy. It is hydrolyzed in the small intestine to three molecules of heptanoic acid that are readily absorbed. Complete beta-oxidation of this fat produces one molecule of propionyl-CoA and two of acetyl-CoA, both of which can enter the citric acid cycle. Alternatively, in the liver, pentanoyl-CoA (the product of the first cycle of FAO) can generate the 5-carbon ketone bodies beta-hydroxypentanoate and beta-ketopenanoate, which can be used as an alternative fuel by peripheral tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Additionally, triheptanoin may suppress lipolysis and accumulation of toxic metabolite production in LCFAODs.</p><p>Use of triheptanoin was first reported in three symptomatic patients with VLCADD who had improvement in cardiac symptoms, muscle weakness and fatigue, hypoglycemia, and hepatomegaly, but not rhabdomyolysis, within the first month of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Subsequent studies showed similar effects in patients with long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD), trifunctional protein deficiency (TFPD), CPT2D, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency (CPT1D), although LCHADD-associated retinopathy was not improved with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a compassionate-use protocol of triheptanoin in patients with varies types of FAODs (11 VLCADD, 5 LCHADD, 2 TFPD, 3 CPT2D, and 1 CACTD), triheptanoin was well tolerated, and patients had reduced hospitalizations, myopathy, and hypoglycemia, although one patient had continued cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Long-term expression up to 20 weeks, as evidenced by maintenance of euglycemia and survival by maintaining body temperature greater than 20&deg;C following a fasting cold challenge, was seen following treatment with a recombinant pseudotyped <span class=\"nowrap\">AAV2/9-VLCAD</span> vector [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No human trials have yet been attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2794313038\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114663 \">table 1</a>) are inborn errors of metabolism that result in failure of mitochondrial beta-oxidation or the carnitine-based transport of fatty acids into mitochondria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59178 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H531148211\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H879518819\" class=\"local\">'Overview of fatty acid oxidation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3747121906\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FAODs lead to deficient energy production and produce widely variable clinical presentations ranging from mild hypotonia in adults to sudden death in infants. Common presenting signs include hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, liver disease and liver failure, cardiac and skeletal myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and retinal degeneration. Patients are most at risk during times of fasting or intercurrent illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H2650938646\" class=\"local\">'Common clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most FAODs are detected through newborn screening (NBS) by tandem mass spectrometry in developed countries. The preferred tests to confirm a diagnosis in an infant with a positive NBS are a plasma acylcarnitine profile and total and free carnitine levels. DNA testing is the most common definitive test and can provide information on final diagnosis. Leukocyte, fibroblast, or liver enzyme assays can be used to determine functional significance of unknown variants identified on DNA sequencing. (See <a href=\"#H3618243062\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of FAODs involves avoidance of prolonged fasting and maintenance of a constant energy supply during times of catabolism. The recommended diet is fat restricted and carbohydrate supplemented for most FAODs. Patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs) are supplemented with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil to provide a substrate for beta-oxidation. Carnitine supplementation is given only if secondary carnitine deficiency is found. (See <a href=\"#H1662189307\" class=\"local\">'Common elements of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of life and survival in patients with FAODs have improved with early detection and institution of therapy due to NBS programs. However, early identification through NBS does not prevent all severe complications and death, and not all disorders are screened in all countries. In addition, available treatments do not completely eliminate disease manifestations, particularly rhabdomyolysis and cardiomyopathy. Symptoms can still be triggered by acute illness or other physiologic stress, resulting in rapid, life-threatening metabolic decompensation.
