The term &quot;precut&quot; has been used to describe this technique because an incision is made on the papilla prior to free cannulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> guidewire cannulation. Many authors have taken issue with this nomenclature, preferring instead to call the maneuver &quot;access papillotomy&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] or &quot;fistulotomy&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Regardless of semantics, the term &quot;precut&quot; is popularly accepted and will be used here.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the commonly used techniques for performing precut sphincterotomy, while providing the authors' perspective on this controversial technique. A discussion on the efficacy and complications of precut sphincterotomy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-efficacy-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precut sphincterotomy: Another perspective on efficacy and complications&quot;</a>.). Because of the controversy surrounding this area, this topic is also presented separately from the perspective of another authority. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precut-access-papillotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precut (access) papillotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precut sphincterotomy is widely considered to be a risky procedure that should be used only by experts and only when all reasonable efforts at gaining access to the biliary tree by conventional methods have failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Most authorities believe that unless there is an absolute need, failure to gain biliary access by itself is not an indication for precut sphincterotomy. Precut sphincterotomy should not be undertaken for a purely diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with low likelihood of therapeutic intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, precut sphincterotomy is reasonable if attempts at conventional cannulation have failed and if there is a compelling need to have biliary access (suspected malignant jaundice, common duct stones, cholangitis, etc). The decision must be made after an honest appraisal of one's own endoscopic skill, the skill of others immediately available, and the availability of percutaneous or surgical methods. In experienced hands and in highly selected cases, precut sphincterotomy can be safe and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/1,2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least five different methods are commonly used by experts to perform precut sphincterotomy, which can be broadly grouped into needle knife and non-needle-knife techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle knife techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precut sphincterotomy has traditionally been accomplished using a needle knife, although a number of variations have been described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Our technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The method we prefer is a variation of needle-knife papillotomy (NKP), in which a thin-wire, needle-knife papillotome (HPC-2, Wilson-Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, NC) is used to incise the papilla in an upward direction beginning at the orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Although similar to the manufacturer's instructions and other published methods, our technique differs in a number of ways.</p><p>We do not use the elevator to stroke upward at the papilla with the needle knife, which we believe increases the risk of perforation and damage to the pancreatic duct (PD). This is because, in stroking upward with the elevator, the needle knife also moves <strong>outward</strong> at the apex of the stroke, sometimes yielding a deeper penetration than intended.</p><p>Instead, after exposing 2 to 3 mm of cutting wire, we lock the elevator in the fully up position and use scope positioning and dials to engage the papillary orifice gently with the needle. The endoscope is rotated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the outer dial is adjusted to ensure an en face position so that the cut will be in the 11 to 12 o'clock direction. Care is taken to ensure that the tip of the needle is just under the roof of the papilla and not impacted against the duodenal wall or the PD orifice. The endoscope is then retracted very slightly, lifting the papilla and placing a small amount of tension on the wire, a maneuver we call &quot;loading the wire&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52590%7EGAST%2F64371\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52590 graphicRef64371 \">figure 1A-B</a>).</p><p>A small burst of blended current is then delivered, yielding an incision 2 to 3 mm long and 2 to 3 mm deep. The endoscope is then withdrawn slightly, and the dials are adjusted as necessary to &quot;load the wire&quot; once more at the top of the freshly made incision. The cut is continued in small increments in this fashion until the incision reaches an arbitrary upper limit (usually well below the first transverse fold, or below the junction of the papilla and the duodenal wall).</p><p>The incision is then carefully inspected for bile seepage. If bile is seen, the area of seepage can be probed gently with a cannula or <span class=\"nowrap\">cannula/guidewire</span> combination in an attempt to access the bile duct. Once access is gained, the sphincterotomy can be completed with a conventional, pull-type papillotome as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75790\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75790 \">figure 2</a>). If no bile is seen, or if careful, gentle probing does not result in free cannulation, the needle knife can be used to unroof more of the papilla, once again beginning at the orifice and advancing through the previously cut area to expose deeper layers. In this way, the papilla can be unroofed by layers until bile flow indicates that an attempt at cannulation is needed. In practice, it is rare to need more than two complete passes of the needle knife (from orifice to apex, in short bursts) to obtain biliary access.</p><p>We believe that our NKP technique is safer than swiping at the papilla using the elevator, a method that lends itself to overuse of the foot pedal and in which it is difficult to control the depth of the cut. From January 1991 to December 1995, we performed 1000 biliary sphincterotomies at our institution, with 154 of these being initiated as NKP (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The overall complication rate (bleeding, pancreatitis, infection, and perforation) was significantly higher compared to non-needle-knife sphincterotomy (3.9 versus 0.71 percent). However, no severe complications were observed in the precut group. Furthermore, the difference in pancreatitis rates (0.36 percent for the non-NKP group and 1.9 percent in the precut group) was not statistically significant.</p><p>Other groups have noted a threefold increase in pancreatitis rates among patients who were difficult to cannulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Therefore, the trend toward an increased pancreatitis rate in our series is not surprising. However, our experience suggests that a well-practiced and careful precut technique may actually prevent many complications that would otherwise be expected due to prolonged and repeated attempts to gain access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevator-directed needle knife</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common method of performing NKP is to use the elevator to direct the needle knife while incising the papilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The mechanics of this technique are similar to what was described above, beginning at the papillary orifice and extending the cut cephalad. However, instead of &quot;loading the needle&quot; by retracting the endoscope, the needle is moved upward with the elevator while applying blended current (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50813\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50813 \">figure 3</a>). Advocates of this technique believe it is safe and effective in experienced hands.</p><p>A modification of this technique involves beginning the incision 2 to 3 mm <strong>above</strong> the ampullary orifice, ostensibly to avoid the PD and its orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Once the bile duct is entered, the sphincterotomy can be completed with a standard, pull-type papillotome, and therapeutic maneuvers can be performed. The lower fibers of the papillary roof need not be transected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Needle knife over pancreatic duct stent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clever variation of NKP has been applied in settings in which biliary cannulation has failed and when a periampullary diverticulum precludes correct orientation of the papilla for conventional NKP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A temporary PD stent is placed, which causes the papilla to protrude from the diverticulum. A needle knife is then used to make an incision along the PD stent, thereby unroofing the papilla. The PD stent is usually left in place after the procedure to help prevent pancreatitis in case the pancreatic sphincter was damaged during the precut.</p><p>Using this method, bile duct cannulation was achieved in seven of eight patients (88 percent) who would otherwise have had a failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. However, two of the eight patients developed pancreatitis (one despite placement of a pancreatic stent). Nevertheless, this may be a useful technique to remember in highly selected individuals with an intradiverticular papilla.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-needle-knife techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-needle-knife techniques involve variations on pull-type sphincterotomy. Only one non-needle-knife technique is commonly used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Transpancreatic sphincter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intriguing non-needle-knife precut technique has been used when attempts at biliary cannulation have repeatedly led to PD cannulation (as shown by injection or by wire placement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The nose of the pull-type papillotome is left in the PD, and the common channel is then unroofed in the biliary direction with the cutting wire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57083 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>An advantage with this technique is that an extra device (eg, a needle knife) is not required, and the pull-type papillotome used is very familiar to the community gastroenterologist. On the other hand, the potential for damage to the PD orifice is great. If a standard papillotome is extended 5 mm or more into the PD, the pancreatic duct sphincter will be involved in the cut, and the risk for pancreatitis is presumed to be high. This risk was not discussed in the original report of this method, which involved a total of 110 patients undergoing endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precut-sphincterotomy-another-perspective-on-indications-and-techniques/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Seventy-one patients underwent standard ES, 32 underwent transpancreatic duct ES, and 7 underwent needle-knife sphincterotomy. The rate of pancreatitis was similar in the standard ES and in the transpancreatic groups (10 versus 12, percent, respectively), a difference that was not statistically significant.</p><p>However, one criticism of this study is that several patients in the standard ES group underwent sphincter of Oddi manometry, a known risk factor for pancreatitis; three of the seven patients who developed pancreatitis had manometry. This may have served to inflate the pancreatitis rate in the conventional ES group. If these patients are excluded from the data analysis, the pancreatitis rate in the standard ES group was only 6.5 percent, approximately one-half that of the transpancreatic precut group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Novel techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of novel techniques have been described in small numbers of patients.
