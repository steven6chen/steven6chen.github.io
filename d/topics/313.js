Accurate diagnosis ensures appropriate treatment for children with AOM, who require antibiotic therapy, and avoidance of antibiotics in children with otitis media with effusion, in whom antibiotics are unnecessary. Accurate diagnosis also prevents overuse of antibiotics, which leads to an increased prevalence of resistant organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The systemic and local signs and symptoms of AOM usually resolve within 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Symptoms and signs resolve more slowly in children who are managed with analgesia and observation than in those who are prescribed appropriate antibiotic therapy. In a 2013 meta-analysis of seven randomized trials and three observational studies (1409 children), ear pain resolved within three days in 50 percent of children and within seven to eight days in 90 percent of children who did not receive antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Whether initially treated with antibiotics or not, persistence of middle ear effusion after the resolution of acute symptoms is common. In a prospective study of 2565 children followed from birth, middle ear effusion (diagnosed via pneumatic otoscopy) persisted for weeks to months after the onset of AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At two weeks, 70 percent still had effusion; at one month, 40 percent still had effusion; at two months, 20 percent still had effusion; and at three months, 10 percent still had effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81406\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81406 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The clinical features, complications, and management of persistent middle ear effusion are discussed separately.

No benefits in rates of early treatment failure or outcomes at two weeks were observed in studies of myringotomy when performed in combination with antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In a 2016 systematic review of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> for pain relief in AOM, fewer children who received oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> or acetaminophen than placebo had pain at 48 hours (7, 10, and 25 percent, respectively [one trial, 219 participants]) with no difference in the rate of adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen appeared to be equally effective, although data were limited (two trials, 39 participants), and data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of combined ibuprofen and acetaminophen versus acetaminophen alone.</p><p>The efficacy of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">benzocaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> in reducing AOM-associated ear pain has also been evaluated in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a trial in which 54 children (5 to 19 years) who presented to an emergency department with ear pain and AOM were randomly assigned to treatment with a topical benzocaine preparation or olive oil placebo, more children in the treatment group reported a 25 percent reduction in ear pain score 30 minutes after treatment (96 versus 70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In a similar trial in 63 children (3 to 12 years) randomly assigned to topical aqueous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> (lignocaine) or saline, more children in the lidocaine group had a 25 percent reduction in ear pain score 30 minutes after treatment (90 versus 70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

A 2007 systematic review found that decongestants and antihistamines alone or in combination were associated with increased medication side effects and did not improve healing or prevent surgery or other complications in AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, treatment with antihistamines may prolong the duration of middle ear effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In children with AOM and known or suspected nasal allergy, an oral decongestant or antihistamine may provide symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. When treating such children with decongestants or antihistamines, practitioners should weigh the relief of nasal symptoms against the reported adverse events and potential for prolongation of middle ear effusion. Nasal glucocorticoids may be a better option.

Most commercial airplanes have pressurized cabins, with the pressure equal to that at 7000 to 10,000 feet. During the flight, middle ear pressure gradually equilibrates through swallowing or absorption of air by the middle ear mucosa. With airplane descent, the pressure in the cabin increases to that at landing altitude. If middle ear pressure does not increase accordingly (ie, if the Eustachian tube &quot;locks in&quot; the reduced pressure, due to obstruction of the nasopharyngeal orifice), the tympanic membrane may be forced medially and stretched, which can lead to painful barotrauma: bleeding into the tympanic membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93461\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93461 \">picture 2</a>), formation of fluid exudates in the middle ear, and occasionally to tympanic membrane rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Upper respiratory infection appears to be a predisposing condition for aerotitis (inflammation of the ear caused by changes in atmospheric pressure, also known as barotitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-barotrauma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ear barotrauma&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Interventions to equalize middle ear and atmospheric pressure have not been well studied in controlled trials. We suggest that children be awake during descent and chewing gum or food (or sucking on a pacifier or bottle if they are too young to chew gum or food) to open the Eustachian tube and facilitate equalization of middle ear pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Autoinflation via the Valsalva maneuver (forced exhalation with the mouth and nose closed) or a purpose-manufactured nasal balloon also may be helpful in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In younger children, nasal bulb suction may be helpful. We do not suggest preflight treatment with antihistamines or decongestants. In a randomized trial, predeparture administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pseudoephedrine</a> did not decrease ear pain but was associated with increased drowsiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>There is little published information describing other adverse effects of airplane travel in children with AOM.
