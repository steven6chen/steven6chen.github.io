The medical literature clearly demonstrates beneficial effects of physical activity on several health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although there are risks associated with exercise in some patients, the benefits outweigh the risks in most patients.</p><p>Counseling patients on exercise may be challenging, as many patients have different perceived barriers to exercising. Thus, an individualized approach to the exercise prescription may be needed to effect behavioral change.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the benefits and risks of exercise in adults, including an evidence-based exercise prescription. Exercise recommendations for children and adolescents, as well as for specific conditions, are discussed in detail elsewhere.

One MET equals the resting metabolic rate of approximately 3.5 mL <span class=\"nowrap\">O2/kg/min,</span> and represents the approximate rate of oxygen consumption of a seated adult at rest. Moderate physical activity includes activity performed at an intensity of 3 to 6 METs, or the equivalent of walking briskly at approximately 5 to 8 km (3 to 5 miles) per hour. Leisure cycling, moderate effort swimming, playing golf (walking), general cleaning at home, or lawn-mowing also constitute moderate physical activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73838\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73838 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Vigorous physical activity includes activity performed at &gt;6 METs, such as running, jump-roping, and calisthenics (eg, push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks).</p><p>Physical fitness can be described as the ability to carry out daily tasks with vigor and alertness, without undue fatigue, and with ample energy to enjoy leisure time pursuits and meet unforeseen emergencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The scope of physical fitness includes cardiorespiratory endurance, skeletal muscular endurance, skeletal muscular strength, skeletal muscular power, speed, flexibility, agility, balance, reaction time, and body composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cardiorespiratory endurance is defined as a health-related component of physical fitness that relates to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen during sustained physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL INACTIVITY AND HEALTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical inactivity is prevalent and associated with poor health outcomes. Despite the widespread prevalence of physical inactivity, its associated health risks, and the potential of increasing physical activity to improve health outcomes, clinicians do not routinely screen patients for physical inactivity or provide adequate counseling. In developed countries, only 13 to 34 percent of primary care patients reported receiving advice on physical activity from their primary care clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The efficacy of exercise counseling is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of exercise counseling'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> &ndash; Worldwide, one out of every five adults is physically inactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Physical inactivity is particularly prevalent in more developed countries and among women, older persons, and those with lower incomes. In addition to lack of regular exercise, the percentage of time spent in sedentary behaviors (watching television or in front of a computer) is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States, many Americans do not meet national guidelines for being physically active. In a sample of children and adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003 to 2004, activity monitoring found that 55 percent of waking hours were spent in sedentary behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Subsequent NHANES data in 2005 to 2006 indicate that the percentage of sedentary time is increasing (58 percent), while time spent in light activity is decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. According to the National Health Interview Survey 2008, 56.5 percent of respondents were not aerobically active, based on the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. In telephone survey data from the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 64.3 percent of adults met minimum physical activity guidelines through non-occupational activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. When occupational activity was included (mostly walking or heavy labor during work), an additional 6.5 percent of adults likely met the guidelines. However, this study was limited by a low response rate and interviews being conducted by telephone only.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Health effects of physical <span class=\"nowrap\">inactivity/sedentary</span> behavior </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Large prospective cohort studies from several countries around the world have found that sedentary behavior is associated with a variety of poor health outcomes, including increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/9,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15-18</a>]. One study calculated the attributable risk for premature mortality and estimated that physical inactivity worldwide causes 9 percent of premature mortality, accounting for 5.3 million deaths worldwide in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A 10 percent reduction in inactivity could avert 533,000 deaths every year. Regular physical activity and higher cardiorespiratory fitness decrease overall mortality in a dose-response fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Health effects of extended sitting time </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Extended sitting time appears to be an independent risk factor for mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. Prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">sitting/sedentary</span> time has also been associated with an increased risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. In a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis, the negative effects of prolonged sedentary time were not mitigated by participation in physical exercise, though the effects were more pronounced at lower levels of physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, other studies have reached different conclusions. One study found that accounting for fitness decreased the association between extended periods of sitting and cardiometabolic biomarkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Another study including over 150,000 adults aged 59 to 82 years found that replacing sitting time with exercise was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For inactive adults (&lt;2 hours of total daily activity), replacing one hour of sitting time with a variety of nonexercise activities (eg, household chores, lawn and garden work, and daily walking outside of exercise) was also associated with decreased all-cause mortality. A 2016 meta-analysis of 16 studies involving over one million individuals confirmed the risks associated with prolonged sitting (over eight hours daily) but found that mortality was not increased among those individuals who engaged in moderate intensity activity (35.5 metabolic equivalents for task [MET]-hours per week; approximately 60 to 75 minutes per day) or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to the total daily duration of sitting, the risk of mortality may be higher among those who sit for prolonged, uninterrupted periods as compared with those who sit for shorter, interrupted periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies evaluating interventions to reduce sitting time have reported mixed results. A 2016 systematic review concluded that there was some evidence that sit-stand desks decrease sitting time but found inconsistent evidence for interventions such as counseling or computer prompts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term adaptations to exercise training include effects upon the musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.

A graded relationship between exercise and the development of common chronic conditions (including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, and some cancers) has been observed, such that greater exercise in midlife was associated with compression of morbidity in later years with a decreased risk of multiple chronic conditions in the last five years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most data on the benefits of exercise come from observational studies. There are no high-quality, long-term, randomized trials of exercise for prevention of cardiovascular disease or death in a healthy population. Large observational studies suggest that regular exercise reduces risk of all-cause mortality for most individuals, including men and women, as well as younger and older populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/1,31-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,31-41</a>]. This risk reduction is seen with recreational and non-recreational physical activity and in countries with low, middle, and high incomes.</p><p>The beneficial effects of exercise appear to be dose-dependent. However, persons who engage in as little as one to two 75-minute sessions of exercise per week (&ldquo;weekend warriors&rdquo;) appear to have decreased all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer-related mortality compared with sedentary individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The evidence also suggests that the benefits of exercise on reducing mortality may plateau after a certain activity level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Doses above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/day</span> for moderate-intensity physical activity in healthy individuals do not appear to be associated with additional reductions in mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Representative studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 33 observational studies (102,980 participants) reported the risk for all-cause mortality related to cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. CRF, based on maximal aerobic capacity, was ranked as high (&ge;10.9 METs), intermediate (7.9 to 10.8 METs), or low (&lt;7.9 METs). Participants with low CRF had an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with those with high CRF (relative risk [RR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.9) and intermediate CRF (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.5). These data indicate that measured aerobic fitness, not just reported exercise, was inversely associated with mortality risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective cohort study, physical activity habits were analyzed in 10,269 Harvard College alumni over 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Those men who engaged in moderately vigorous sports activity had a 23 percent lower risk of death than those who were less active. The improvement in survival with exercise was equivalent and additive to other lifestyle measures such as smoking cessation, control of hypertension, and avoidance of obesity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56864 \">figure 2</a>). This highlights the importance of exercise given that the specific benefits of regular exercise persist despite individuals attempting to improve multiple lifestyle habits concurrently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate levels of physical activity appear to confer a significant health benefit, although greater amounts of activity afford greater protection from premature death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74679 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Vigorous exercise (at least 20 minutes three times a week) combined with regular exercise (at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week) was associated with a 50 percent decreased mortality risk in an observational study involving over 250,000 men and women aged 50 to 71 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Data from the Framingham Heart Study show that moderate and high, compared with low, physical activity levels increase life expectancy for men at age 50 by 1.3 and 3.7 years, respectively; results were similar for women (1.5 and 3.5 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total daily activity energy expenditure may correlate more strongly with mortality benefit than self-reported exercise intensity.

As an example, the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial found that, of 3617 asymptomatic men with hypercholesterolemia, the cumulative incidence of activity-related acute cardiac events was only 2 percent during a mean follow-up of 7.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

Two screening tools, the American Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA)/American</span> College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Preparticipation Questionnaire (AAPQ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] and the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>] have been developed as self-screening tools to identify individuals who should have a clinician assessment prior to initiating a moderately intense exercise regimen. However, in one study that entered data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for respondents older than 40 years into the AAPQ criteria, over 90 percent would have met criteria for a clinician evaluation, making this tool of questionable value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The AAPQ and PAR-Q produced similar results for about 70 percent of respondents.</p><p>Although the available data are not strong enough to reach consensus on the identity of groups for which screening is appropriate, many clinicians perform periodic exercise ECG tests in asymptomatic individuals with multiple cardiovascular risk factors including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and a history of premature myocardial infarction (MI) or sudden cardiac death (SCD) in a first-degree relative under age 60. A positive exercise ECG test in such patients is associated with an increased risk of subsequent MI and death.

A general weekly goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity is ideal for many people. As sedentary lifestyles are associated with health risks and even modest increases in physical activity are associated with improved health outcomes, it is also reasonable to advocate for a modest increase in physical activity even if the specific goals above are not met.

However, in the long-term, home-based programs were superior to center-based programs in terms of adherence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428231389\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensity and frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several large cohort studies have found that increasing exercise intensity is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/35,37,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37,97</a>] (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of exercise'</a> above). Most guidelines recommend moderate to vigorous exercise intensity at least a few times per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/2,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,98</a>]. However, the intensity and frequency of an exercise prescription varies based on a given individual.</p><p>One of the most important parameters of exercise is total aerobic activity. A key finding of the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, based on a systematic review of the evidence, was that 500 to 1000 MET-minutes per week was the necessary amount of physical activity to produce substantial health benefits, including a substantial reduction in the risk of premature death and breast cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74679 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As the term METs (metabolic equivalents) is not readily understandable by many patients, these guidelines recommend the equivalent in minutes of moderate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vigorous exercise per week. As an example, 150 minutes of walking (3.3 METs) per week is equal to 500 MET-minutes per week and meets the weekly recommendations for exercise in most individuals.</p><p>Higher-intensity activity may lead to additional gains in aerobic fitness. As an example, high-intensity interval walking (repeated alternating three minute sets of high- and low-intensity walking), compared with moderate-intensity continuous walking, resulted in greater improvements in blood pressure and muscle strength in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Another popular form of exercise is high-intensity interval training, which involves repeated, brief sessions of high-intensity exercise over short periods of time. Although there is no standard regimen, one program for high-intensity interval training includes 30 seconds of &quot;all-out&quot; effort cycling or running repeated four to six times and separated by four minutes of recovery for a total of two to three minutes of intense training weekly for several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. High-intensity interval training is found to have several short-term physiologic benefits, including improved cardiorespiratory fitness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. However, the long-term health effects of high-intensity interval training are not known. The potential for greater compliance and duration of exercise with moderate activity and increased injury with high-intensity exercise should be factored in to determining an appropriate exercise prescription.</p><p>A sedentary person should begin physical activity with short duration of low- or moderate-intensity activity and gradually increase the duration and intensity until the goal is reached. The greatest health benefits appear to be in those who move from sedentary to moderate-level activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Exercise can be performed for short periods several times a day and integrated into the course of one's daily life. In one randomized trial of previously sedentary healthy adults, subjects who engaged in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week had similar cardiovascular and blood pressure benefits as those who underwent a structured exercise program involving three or more sessions of supervised vigorous physical activity per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. In one large prospective cohort study, individuals who engaged in brief physical activity (15 minutes daily or 90 minutes weekly) had a 14 percent reduction in all-cause mortality and a three-year longer life expectancy compared with those who were inactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Using less vigorous recommendations for exercise may help more patients increase their activity level and accrue health benefits.</p><p>Resistance training can supplement aerobic exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. One common regimen includes free weights or exercise equipment consisting of 10 to 15 repetitions of each exercise for arms, shoulders, chest, trunk, back, hips, and legs performed two to three times a week.</p><p>Markers indicating an adequate degree of exercise include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathlessness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p/><p>Achievement of goal heart rate is <strong>not</strong> necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

The World Health Organization and the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity weekly for all adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/2,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,98</a>]. Patients with sedentary lifestyles should start with small amounts of physical activity and gradually increase duration, frequency, and intensity over time. Adults with poor mobility should stay as physically active as their condition allows and, if possible, perform physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on three or more days weekly. Muscle-strengthening activities that involve major muscle groups should be done on two or more days a week to provide additional benefit. Guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) are similar, recommending either moderate-intensity exercise for 30 minutes for a minimum of five days a week, strenuous exercise for 20 minutes three days a week, or a combination of these activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263834579\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the benefits of an exercise program, there are risks as noted above, even in trained athletes (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Risks of exercise'</a> above). As a result, the AHA published a summary outlining the absolute and relative contraindications for exercise testing and training (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110 \">table 5</a>). The absolute contraindications include severe cardiac disease (eg, unstable angina, uncontrolled symptomatic heart failure) and acute noncardiac disease (eg, infection, renal failure).

Recommendations for injury prevention should be tailored to specific populations. As an example, older populations may be at risk for falls. As the older population may injure more easily and recover more slowly, some patients will need to have supervised exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Strategies to reduce running injuries are discussed separately.

The warm-up can include stretching exercises, walking, or calisthenics; a period of five minutes should be adequate. Stretching exercises should be a slow dynamic movement followed by static stretch that is sustained for approximately 30 seconds. There should be no bouncing into the stretch or during the stretch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cool-down</strong> &ndash; &quot;Cool-down&quot; after exercise for a period of approximately five minutes may facilitate lactate removal from muscles, the slow return from vasodilation, and gradual return of blood to the central circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].

The activity should be enjoyable and the person should feel both competent and safe while active. The activity should be readily accessible on a regular basis, and it should fit easily into the individual's daily schedule. The activity should not generate unbearable financial or social costs. Parents, other family members, and peers can provide a positive influence for initiating and maintaining physical activity.</p><p>Physical activity in childhood predicts a continued active lifestyle into and through adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Physically active parents can serve as role models for their children. Schools are also a major community resource to foster increased physical activity and promote a physically active lifestyle in children.</p><p>The use of a pedometer may help motivate individuals to increase physical activity. A systematic review found that use of a pedometer worn throughout the day, combined with a specific goal for number of steps taken per day, increased physical activity by 27 percent and was associated with modest decline in BMI and blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of exercise counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several systematic reviews have evaluated whether exercise counseling impacts levels of physical activity or secondary outcomes of increased activity (eg, physical fitness or metabolic parameters). Results have mostly supported some effectiveness for increasing self-reported activity levels but less impact on more objective outcomes. Results of these systematic reviews include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2012 systematic review of randomized trials of primary care promotion of physical activity for sedentary individuals found a small to medium positive effect on self-reported increased activity over 12 months and a nonsignificant positive effect on cardiorespiratory fitness (odds ratio [OR] 1.38, 95% CI 0.98-1.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].

This recommendation is based upon the small benefit observed from counseling in the primary care setting and the time involved in providing the counseling that may otherwise be used to provide services of greater benefit. Nevertheless, the potential health benefits of even modest increases in exercise suggest that counseling to increase physical activity is likely warranted.</p><p>More intensive, individualized counseling with scheduled follow-up may be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>], including a personalized exercise prescription from primary care clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>] or through an exercise referral program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].
