The most frequently occurring form of SCD is caused by homozygous presence of hemoglobin S (HbSS). Hemoglobin S results from the substitution of a valine for glutamic acid as the sixth amino acid of the beta globin chain. The resulting hemoglobin tetramer <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/betaS2)</span> is poorly soluble when deoxygenated. Other forms of SCD include HbSC disease, in which an individual is a compound heterozygote for the sickle mutation and hemoglobin C (created by substitution of lysine for glutamic acid as the sixth amino acid), and sickle hemoglobin-beta thalassemia<sup>0 or +</sup> in which one beta chain allele has the HbS mutation and the other has a beta thalassemia mutation with reduced or absent production of the beta chain.</p><p>Deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin polymerizes into sheets of elongated rope-like fibers, causing a marked decrease in red cell deformability and distortion of the cell into the classic crescent or sickle shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64449\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64449 \">picture 1</a>), the primary pathophysiologic event responsible for vaso-occlusive complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64449\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64449 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Vaso-occlusive phenomena and hemolysis are the clinical hallmarks of SCD and result in recurrent painful episodes (previously called sickle cell crisis) and a variety of serious organ system complications that can lead to life-long disabilities and premature death. However, hemoglobin polymerization alone does not account for the full pathophysiology of SCD. Subsequent changes in red cell membrane structure and function, disordered cell volume control, and increased adherence to vascular endothelium also play an important role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

ACS is defined as a new segmental opacity on chest radiograph accompanied by fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory symptoms in a patient with SCD. Etiologies include pulmonary vasoocclusion and ischemia, pneumonia, fat embolization, and thrombosis (either intravascular or thromboembolic). Discussions of the acute chest syndrome in children, adolescents, and adults are presented separately.

Many SCD patients begin to experience subtle declines in their exercise capacity in early to late adolescence, and a careful history will often reveal self-limitations on previously performed sports and exertional activities. This subtle dyspnea becomes more overt as these patients reach adulthood. Screening questionnaires of 147 adults with HbSS and HbSC have helped to characterize this symptom more objectively. Approximately 50 percent of adults with HbSS and 40 percent of those with HbSC experience dyspnea with mild to moderate exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The etiology of chronic dyspnea in SCD is likely multi-factorial. While anemia is an important contributor, other explanations for dyspnea often co-exist. A careful history (including specific questions about exercise limitations and level of conditioning), physical examination, comparison of hemoglobin level with baseline values, pulmonary function tests, and ambulatory oximetry are recommended to fully characterize dyspnea in this population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94508 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Generally, this initial evaluation will provide clues as to the etiology of chronic dyspnea and direct further studies and management, as described in the following sections. Common causes of dyspnea in chronic SCD include anemia, deconditioning, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary fibrosis from recurrent acute chest events, and myocardial dysfunction. These conditions are discussed below and separately.

In these discussions, pediatric patients are defined by an age &lt;18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In a cross-sectional evaluation from the multi-center Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, pulmonary function was assessed in 310 adult African-American subjects with HbSS disease irrespective of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Only 10 percent of these patients had completely normal PFTs.

Even when corrected for anemia, the DLCO is often low, particularly in patients with a history of the acute chest syndrome (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide-dlco-correction-of-predicted-value-for-anemia\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide-dlco-correction-of-predicted-value-for-anemia-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Longitudinal studies of pulmonary function in adults with SCD demonstrate an average decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 49 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year</span> compared with 20 to 26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year</span> in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The decline is unrelated to smoking status. </p><p>Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) is reduced in adults with SCD, with steady-state baseline values below 96 percent in an appreciable portion of patients. Significant desaturations occur with exertion and with sleep. A widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient is observed both at rest and with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Thus, we suggest performing spirometry in children with SCD every one to three years, using the more frequent intervals for those with dyspnea, a history of asthma or recurrent wheezing, or accentuated elevations in hemolytic markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>While restrictive physiology, as observed in adults, can occur in the pediatric age group, a number of studies of non-referred cohorts report a predominance of obstructive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 127 children and adolescents with SCD found that obstructive airways disease was present in 35 percent while restrictive physiology occurred in 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In this study, 39 percent had abnormal PFTs with an obstructive pattern present in 19 percent, restrictive in 9 percent, and abnormal but not characterized in 11 percent. Increasing age, a family or patient history of asthma or wheezing, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level reflective of hemolysis were all predictive of obstructive physiology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 149 non-referred HbSS or HbS-beta<sup>0</sup> children and adolescents participating in the NIH-funded Sleep and Asthma Cohort Study found that percentages of normal, obstructive, restrictive, nonspecific, and mixed lung function patterns were 70, 16, 7, 6, and 1, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Lung function pattern was not predictive of future episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis or acute chest syndrome, nor reflective of prior history of acute chest syndrome, thus calling into question the predictive role of PFTs in this population.</p><p/><p>Measurements of SpO<sub>2</sub> are typically below normal in children with SCD. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort study of 130 children from the Cooperative Study for Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), mean and median daytime SpO<sub>2</sub> were 94 and 95 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results (95 to 96 percent) were seen in three other studies of mean daytime SpO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 39 SCD patients (median age of 10.8 years) found that 45 percent had post-exercise hypoxemia defined as an SpO<sub>2</sub> decrease &ge;3 percent after a six-minute walk test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>In contrast to nocturnal hypoxemia, daytime SpO<sub>2</sub> does not appear to independently predict subsequent pain or acute chest episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, there are currently no data correlating daytime SpO<sub>2</sub> with nighttime SpO<sub>2</sub>, which generally is lower than daytime values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Nevertheless, SpO<sub>2</sub> values below baseline measurements for individual patients with SCD, either at rest or following exercise, are useful in detecting and monitoring for the presence of pulmonary complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91141765\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is common in patients with SCD, particularly among children and adolescents, and may affect the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. As an example, in a case control study, asthma was more common among 80 children with SCD than among ethnically-matched controls (48 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similarly, small cohort studies suggest that children with SCD are at increased risk for developing airway hyperreactivity and airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>The interrelationship of asthma and SCD is complex and not well-understood. Children with a history of acute chest syndrome (ACS) are more likely to develop asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It is thought that severe airway narrowing due to asthma can lead to local hypoxia and promote sickling and systemic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, recurrent ACS may contribute to lung inflammation and increased bronchial hyperreactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. While some patients clearly have an atopic phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], others do not, suggesting that non-allergic mediated inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of asthma in patients with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The contribution of asthma to ACS is discussed separately.

The presence of intermittent or chronic symptoms and wheezing on examination should lead to an evaluation for asthma. As in other settings, the diagnosis of asthma is based upon the demonstration of variable airflow limitation, preferably by spirometry before and after bronchodilator, and exclusion of alternate diagnoses. In addition to asthma, the differential diagnosis of wheezing in a patient with SCD includes processes such as decompensated heart failure, viral infection, gastroesophageal reflux, congenital abnormalities (eg, vascular ring, congenital lobar emphysema), bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, and vocal cord dysfunction.

Nocturnal desaturations can occur with or without the coexistence of OSA; their etiology is not well defined. Sleep-disordered breathing is under-appreciated and consequently, often under-treated in SCD. A standardized approach for screening and treating these patients has not been developed. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> &ndash; Many patients with SCD and SDB do not report symptoms of SDB, and the exact prevalence of SDB in asymptomatic patients is not known. Some studies in children and adolescents have reported a prevalence of up to 79 percent, but most of these data emanate from relatively small retrospective cohorts of symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

Another small prospective study of 20 adults between 21 and 30 years of age found that 10 had an AHI &gt;5 consistent with OSA irrespective of symptoms; this was associated with reduced health related quality of life and increased systolic blood pressures. Interestingly, OSA in these patients was not associated with either obesity or a history of snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Etiology</strong> &ndash; The etiology of SDB is not well understood in sickle cell disease. Children and adolescents with SCD have reduced upper airway diameters and increased adenoid and tonsillar size (known risk factors for OSA) compared with normal volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. It has been presumed that OSA is the primary cause of nocturnal hypoxemia in SCD, but this is not necessarily the case. In one study of 20 patients with nocturnal hypoxemia, 12 did not have obstructive events during a 16 channel polysomnogram (PSG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], which may explain why adenotonsillectomy fails to correct hypoxemia in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a cohort of 243 children with sickle cell anemia who had not previously been evaluated for SDB, the only independent risk factors for moderate to severe OSA were habitual snoring and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &lt;96 percent while awake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Furthermore, oxygen desaturations with sleep are associated with daytime hypoxemia in SCD, suggesting that the pathologic impact on the endothelium is not limited to sleep-related events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A retrospective study in adults and children with SCD referred for a sleep study identified isolated nocturnal hypoxemia in both age groups, which was associated with reduced daytime oxygen saturations at rest, and markers of worsening anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is some evidence linking nocturnal hypoxemia with an increased rate of both vasoocclusive episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>] and cerebrovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], but these data are inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

The median sleep and awake SpO<sub>2</sub> values were also greater in the hydroxyurea group. No difference was observed in the apnea-hypopnea index or the frequency of OSA.

Although SDB may be exacerbated by adenoid and tonsillar hypertrophy, adenotonsillectomy is often not curative in SCD patients, and its impact on cardiopulmonary outcomes is unclear.
