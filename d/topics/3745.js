Affected patients typically present with proteinuria (often but not always in the nephrotic range) and a normal or only slightly elevated serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In addition, patients with lupus membranous nephropathy frequently have microscopic hematuria, and some may have nephrotic syndrome (with hypoalbuminemia and edema) and hypertension.</p><p>The presence of significant hematuria and cellular casts with or without an elevated serum creatinine suggests concurrent proliferative disease, which is not uncommon and is associated with a much worse prognosis than class V alone. In a review of 79 patients with lupus membranous nephropathy, 36 had pure membranous lesions, 15 had endocapillary proliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis in less than 50 percent of glomeruli, and 28 had endocapillary proliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis in more than 50 percent of glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>Extrarenal or serologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently precede but can occasionally develop after the onset of kidney disease. Lupus membranous nephropathy is the one form of LN that may present with few or no other clinical or serologic manifestations of SLE (eg, complement levels may be normal, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, which are highly specific for SLE, may not be elevated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/6,8,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,11-13</a>]. In a randomized trial of 42 patients with lupus membranous nephropathy described below, low C3, low C4, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were present in 3, 3, and 9 patients, respectively (7, 7, and 21 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, patients without extrarenal or serologic manifestations of SLE who have a renal biopsy suggesting lupus membranous nephropathy (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below) should be regarded as having LN and are at risk of subsequently developing other manifestations of SLE.

In addition, lupus membranous nephropathy should be suspected in any patient with known underlying SLE who develops significant proteinuria. The diagnosis is confirmed in such patients by renal biopsy.

Such patients appear to have a much worse renal prognosis than those with pure lupus membranous nephropathy.</p><p>In addition, renal biopsy may reveal concurrent lesions of thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to the antiphospholipid syndrome, which may require additional therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiphospholipid syndrome and the kidney&quot;, section on 'Renal disease in antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported renal survival rates are variable among patients with lupus membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/6,9,10,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10,15-18</a>]. One reason is that many studies included patients who also had proliferative lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Such patients are more likely to develop end-stage renal disease compared with those who have pure lupus membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/9,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,18</a>]. Other contributing factors to variable outcomes include differences in patient populations and in immunosuppressive therapies that may be used for extrarenal indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The importance of concurrent proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) was demonstrated in a retrospective study that compared 5- and 10-year survival of patients with different histology on renal biopsy: 36 patients with pure lupus membranous nephropathy; 15 with combined membranous and focal (&lt;50 percent of glomeruli) proliferative lesions; and 28 with combined membranous and diffuse (&ge;50 percent of glomeruli) proliferative lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The better outcomes with pure lupus membranous nephropathy occurred even though such patients were much less likely to be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>.</p><p>Studies of patients with pure lupus membranous nephropathy have suggested a 10-year renal survival of 72 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/9,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12</a>]. In the above study, the percentage of patients with end-stage renal disease at five years was significantly higher in those who had concurrent diffuse proliferative lesions compared with those with pure lupus membranous nephropathy (43 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Patients with lupus membranous nephropathy may have proliferative lesions at presentation or develop them over time, often in association with worsening renal function or a substantial change in the activity of the urinary sediment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. In one series, 29 patients who were initially diagnosed with lupus membranous nephropathy with little or no mesangial proliferation underwent a second biopsy at a mean follow-up of 6.9 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The decision to use anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events in patients with severe nephrotic syndrome is individualized and discussed separately.

The recommended optimal goal for protein excretion in proteinuric chronic kidney diseases is less than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. If this goal cannot be achieved, we suggest a minimum reduction in protein excretion of at least 50 to 60 percent from the baseline level <strong>plus</strong> protein excretion less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. The supportive data are presented elsewhere.

However, the relative contributions of immunosuppressive therapy, angiotensin inhibition, and blood pressure reduction to any fall in protein excretion cannot usually be determined.</p><p>Other small observational studies evaluated the efficacy of angiotensin inhibition in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy. The results are conflicting and suggest that the antiproteinuric response to angiotensin inhibition may be lower in membranous nephropathy than in other glomerular diseases. There are no reliable data on the efficacy of angiotensin inhibition on disease progression in lupus membranous nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12607632\"><span class=\"h2\">Goal blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on goal blood pressure specifically in patients with lupus membranous nephropathy are lacking. However, it is likely similar to goal blood pressure in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease in general, which is presented elsewhere.

Such a change represents the loss of one-third of her glomerular filtration rate, but the serum creatinine is still well within the normal range of the laboratory.

In addition, the higher the level of baseline proteinuria, the longer the time to response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thus, changes in the immunosuppressive regimen should not be made too early during the course of therapy.

In addition, patients with lupus membranous nephropathy frequently have microscopic hematuria and may have nephrotic syndrome (with hypoalbuminemia and edema) and hypertension. The presence of significant hematuria and cellular casts suggests concurrent proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) (rather than pure lupus membranous nephropathy). Lupus membranous nephropathy is the one form of LN that may present with few or no other clinical or serologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; eg, complement levels may be normal, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, which are highly specific for SLE, may not be elevated). Thus, patients without extrarenal or serologic manifestations of SLE who have a renal biopsy suggesting lupus membranous nephropathy should be regarded as having LN and are at risk of subsequently developing other manifestations of SLE. (See <a href=\"#H28872172\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus membranous nephropathy should be suspected in patients who present with nephrotic-range proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome (particularly in young female patients and in those with clinical or serologic manifestations suggestive of SLE). In addition, lupus membranous nephropathy should be suspected in any patient with known underlying SLE who develops significant proteinuria. The diagnosis is confirmed in such patients by renal biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H1741655306\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly all patients with lupus membranous nephropathy should be treated with antihypertensive, antiproteinuric, and lipid-lowering measures. Other aspects of therapy include diuretics to control edema and maintenance of adequate nutrition. Some patients also receive anticoagulation to prevent venous thromboembolism. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Nonimmunosuppressive therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal vein thrombosis and hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no randomized trials in patients with pure lupus membranous nephropathy comparing immunosuppressive therapy in addition to nonimmunosuppressive therapy with nonimmunosuppressive therapy alone. The authors and reviewers of this topic do <strong>not</strong> completely agree about who should receive immunosuppressive therapy (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Indications for immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with pure lupus membranous nephropathy who have nephrotic syndrome or, in the absence of nephrotic syndrome, persistent proteinuria &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> despite nonimmunosuppressive therapy, or a progressive rise in serum creatinine above baseline, we suggest treating with immunosuppressive therapy in addition to nonimmunosuppressive therapy rather than nonimmunosuppressive therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In addition, patients with mixed membranous and proliferative lesions on biopsy (ie, class V plus either class III or IV LN) should be treated with immunosuppressive therapy according to the proliferative lesion. All contributors to this topic agree on these points.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most of the authors and reviewers suggest that immunosuppressive drugs should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients who lack one or more of the poor prognostic indicators mentioned above, given the potential toxicity of immunosuppression. Patients without these findings generally have a good renal prognosis and may not require immunosuppressive therapy unless it is needed for extrarenal manifestations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By contrast, some of the contributors to this topic suggest that, even in the absence of these poor prognostic signs, all patients with lupus membranous nephropathy should receive immunosuppressive therapy. Although patients with primary membranous nephropathy commonly have a spontaneous remission, those with lupus membranous nephropathy do <strong>not</strong> spontaneously remit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have <strong>concurrent</strong> lupus membranous nephropathy and proliferative LN are treated according to the proliferative lesion. In patients with <strong>pure</strong> lupus membranous nephropathy selected for immunosuppression, our approach is as follows (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Choice of immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF), in combination with glucocorticoids, as initial therapy, rather than other agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who have a contraindication to or cannot tolerate MMF, we suggest treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or a calcineurin inhibitor, in combination with glucocorticoids, rather than other immunosuppressive drugs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> has been studied more extensively than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> in patients with lupus membranous nephropathy, and therefore, some experts treat with cyclosporine if a calcineurin inhibitor is given. However, tacrolimus is associated with a lower risk of cosmetic and metabolic side effects; as a result, many clinicians prefer tacrolimus over cyclosporine as the calcineurin inhibitor of choice, especially in females.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do <strong>not</strong> use glucocorticoid monotherapy to treat lupus membranous nephropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MMF and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> should be avoided in patients who are pregnant or who could become pregnant. We generally avoid calcineurin inhibitors in patients who have significantly reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) because of the potential nephrotoxicity of these drugs.
