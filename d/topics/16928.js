TMD is classified as a subtype of a secondary headache disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The goals of managing temporomandibular disorders are to alleviate pain and improve jaw function.</p><p>TMD is associated with substantial morbidity and affects individual work productivity and quality of life. In the United States, it is estimated that for every 100 million working adults, TMD contributes to 17.8 million lost work days annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of temporomandibular disorders. The evaluation of temporomandibular joint dislocation is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporomandibular-joint-tmj-dislocation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713551742\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of and risk factors for temporomandibular disorders (TMD) have been assessed in different study populations. In one survey of adults in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of orofacial pain was 26 percent, with 6 percent reporting pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and 6 percent reporting preauricular pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Observational studies in patients with TMD have illustrated the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of TMD is about 1.5 times higher in women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The greatest risk of onset of TMD is between the ages of 18 and 44 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-Hispanic Caucasians have a higher risk for TMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There does not seem to be an association with socioeconomic group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an association between chronic TMD and mood disorders and other psychiatric comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are more likely to develop temporomandibular pain at some point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The prevalence of TMD in patients with RA ranges from 53 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In one observational study, individuals with more severe RA (erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt;32.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span> were at increased risk for TMD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMD is weakly associated with teeth grinding (bruxism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A systematic review showed a slight association between bruxism and TMD symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although not formally studied, gum chewing, pencil biting, pipe smoking, and other repetitive jaw motions and positions (eg, violinists, singers, and woodwind players), are thought to be associated with TMD pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713551750\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a long time, the cause of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) was attributed to changes in dental occlusion (the alignment of the upper and lower teeth) that affected maxillomandibular position and function. Although there is a structural component to TMD, biologic, behavioral, environmental, and cognitive factors all play a role in the development of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713552171\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ligaments, articular cartilage, disc, and bone produces oxidative stress and generates free radicals in the intraarticular space. Subsequent synovial fluid inflammation produces cytokines that cause degenerative TMJ disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Joint trauma can result from whiplash injuries, bruxism, or external injuries to the jaw [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. TMJ disc displacements can also cause TMD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713552178\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain threshold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is also a subjective component to the perception of TMD pain. Differences in pain modulation have been reported in both women and men with temporomandibular disorders compared with healthy controls. In a small case-control study, women with TMD demonstrated lower pain tolerance than control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Functional brain imaging studies in people with TMD demonstrated increased activation of the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex, and decreased thalamic activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This pattern of neural activation is similar to activation in patients with other chronic pain disorders and may be related to abnormal pain processing in the trigeminal system. In particular, muscle pain disorders appear to have little, if any, abnormality of the muscles or peripheral tissues and may represent a central sensitization pain producing process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Genetic marker studies suggest that certain gene polymorphisms (eg, the catechol-O-methyl transferase [<em>COMT</em>] gene) might be associated with differences in pain response and processing in patients with chronic TMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713552464\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies support an association between chronic TMD and psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or a history of abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. A small observational study reported that individuals with depression had an increased risk of TMJ pain compared with euthymic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1144190397\"><span class=\"h2\">Head and cervical posture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor head and cervical posture has been thought to be a cause of TMD and pain because of the muscular attachments that connect the mandible and head and neck. A systematic review found that the studies of associations between <span class=\"nowrap\">cervical/head</span> posture and TMD were of poor methodology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The association, if any, is still unclear; however, some evidence suggests that there is a relationship between the cervical plexus of nerves and face and TMD type pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242703351\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three distinct elements contributing to temporomandibular disorder (TMD) are muscle dysfunction, specific problems with the temporomandibular joint, and cervical spinal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, symptoms are characterized by acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain triggered by jaw motion, dysfunction of the masticatory system, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) tenderness, and neck stiffness and pain. The anatomic source of pain can originate from the TMJ or the muscles of mastication that attach to the TMJ or move the jaw (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57658\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57658 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In a retrospective study of 4528 patients with TMD, the most common presenting signs and symptoms were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain (96.1 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear discomfort or dysfunction (82.4 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache (79.3 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMJ discomfort or dysfunction (75.0 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104372631\"><span class=\"h2\">Facial pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain of TMD is unilateral facial pain, described as a dull, constant ache that waxes and wanes in intensity. The pain can radiate to the ear, temporal and periorbital regions, the angle of the mandible, and, frequently, the posterior neck. It can be present daily or intermittently, with many patients having periods when they do not have any pain. Patients can also have episodes of sharper, more intense, pain. Patients may describe this as &quot;sinus&quot; pain in the zygomatic or orbital area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Pain is worsened by jaw motion.</p><p>Clenching, acute or chronic stress, loss of posterior teeth combined with daytime tooth clenching can create muscle trigger points or muscle fatigue. This is noted by the patient after meals and reported as a &quot;heavy and tired feeling&quot; in the jaw muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1165514831\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear pain, stuffiness, and tinnitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ear pain, stuffiness, and tinnitus may have a musculoskeletal etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The trigeminal nerve that innervates the medial pterygoid muscles (which help stabilize the mandible during movement) also innervates the middle ear muscles. The tensor tympani and tensor palati also wrap around the hamulus notch of the maxilla, so TMD can present with otologic symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54135\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54135 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Tinnitus can also have a peripheral musculoskeletal etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Specifically, cervical and mandibular postural factors (eg, repetitive postures) that appear to affect the normal musculoskeletal mechanics have been noted in people with tinnitus. Somatic tinnitus has been shown to be affected by altering maxillomandibular relationships and with manual physical therapy to the cervical paraspinal musculature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-tinnitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of tinnitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unilateral sharp, jabbing ear pain with mandibular movement is reported frequently in patients who have an internal derangement of the ipsilateral TMJ. Ear pain and symptoms in the absence of positive otologic findings are among the most common reasons to evaluate for the presence of TMD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1165514956\"><span class=\"h2\">Headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical headache associated with TMD is described as unilateral ear or preauricular pain that radiates to the jaw, temple, or neck. The pain is deep, dull, continuous, moderate in intensity, aching, and usually worse in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. The headache can also be bilateral, originating from postural muscles or the muscles of mastication. Pain exacerbations are often provoked by use of the affected muscles. Morning headaches may be caused by nocturnal bruxism or sleep disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], while increasing pain during the day may be related to masticatory muscle use or head posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Some individuals present with headache without being aware of having a TMJ problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. In addition to the typical headache, other manifestations of TMD-related headache include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Front of head </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Patients complaining of pain in the front of the head often refer to it as sinus headache. There is usually accompanying pressure along the upper front teeth, bridge of the nose, and behind the eyes. &quot;Sinus headaches&quot; are generally not due to sinus disease but are a primary headache disorder. Posterior neck muscle contractions or frontalis muscle tension can also cause band-like pains in the front of the head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Side of head </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Temporal headaches are primarily caused by muscle contraction and spasm of the temporalis muscle. The anterior temporalis muscle fibers bring the lower jaw up and forward. The middle and posterior fibers swing the jaw to full closure and retract the mandible. Teeth clenching, grinding, or biting on objects while the jaw is in an anteriorly displaced position causes pain in the anterior temporalis group. Individuals who work at desk jobs where the head is kept forward and down tend to clench and grind their teeth in this forward position, with gravity affecting the mandible. Headaches in the temporal area are also brought on by chronic pencil or pen biting, pipe smoking, or gum chewing. Bruxism during sleep or in a posterior position tires the middle and posterior group of temporalis fibers, causing pain in a more posterior temporal location. Generally, the temporalis muscle is affected by any dysfunction of the lower jaw [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Back of head </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Deep, dull, constant pain in the back of the head is usually caused by spasms of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. When tensed or strained, these muscles pull on their bony attachments to the skull in the occiput and mastoid areas, leading to soreness in the bone and pain radiating to the back of the head and neck.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1144190418\"><span class=\"h2\">Jaw and TMJ dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jaw and TMJ dysfunction manifests as decreased mandibular range of motion, clicking or popping noises with jaw function, involuntary jaw clenching or teeth grinding, or jaw deviation to the affected side. Jaw locking can be present but is atypical; it is described as the inability to open the mouth, but sometimes inability to close the mouth. Symptoms are usually worse in the morning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1165515139\"><span class=\"h2\">Other symptoms</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1165515147\"><span class=\"h3\">Neck pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neck stiffness and pain is a common TMD symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Trauma, bad posture, and musculoskeletal tension in the cervical area create pain, stiffness, and trigger points in the muscles of the head and neck. Loss of vertical dimension of the teeth and a deep bite can also affect cervical function, leading to neck stiffness, pain, and reduced range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1372548458\"><span class=\"h3\">Eye pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orbital and periorbital pain symptoms in patients with TMD are often described as unilateral, constant, and &quot;boring&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/36,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,54-56</a>]. Patients with a history of trauma, chronic upper cervical vertebral subluxations, or nerve root impingements in the occiput or atlantoaxial region may present with eye pain. In addition, entrapment of the greater occipital nerve at the occiput level can also produce this type of pain, which is often diagnosed as occipital neuralgia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occipital-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occipital neuralgia&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1165515166\"><span class=\"h3\">Arm and back pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with TMD may also present with shoulder pain that radiates down the arm. The pain may be accompanied by tingling or numbness. Arm or back pain associated with TMD can be attributed to a number of causes, including rotator cuff injury, nerve impingement of the brachial plexus, vertebral subluxations, or thoracic outlet syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thoracic-outlet-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thoracic outlet syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;, section on 'Cervical spinal column injury'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1372548466\"><span class=\"h3\">Dizziness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with TMD may have dizziness that is associated with ear pain and stuffiness or cervical muscle strain and tension. Other causes of dizziness should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dizziness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dizziness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26338311\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is based on the history and findings on physical examination. A history of facial pain, pain with jaw function, limitation of jaw movement, and cracking or popping noise with jaw function are all typical with TMD. Physical examination findings that characterize TMD are: facial or jaw pain, limited mouth opening, and TMJ noises with function.</p><p>Imaging studies may, in some cases, clarify the diagnosis. Imaging is generally used when there may be an articular disc derangement disorder, an <span class=\"nowrap\">arthropathy/arthritide,</span> or some sort of tumor. Typically, plain film panoramic radiography of the jaws is used as initial imaging, with maxillofacial cone-beam CT scanning and MRI of the temporomandibular joints as additional imaging depending on the rest of the diagnostic evaluation findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1372548282\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals will present most often with complaints of facial pain, headache, ear symptoms, TMJ pain, or symptoms of jaw dysfunction. Individuals need to be asked about history of any TMJ or jaw trauma. The history includes questions about sleep habits and position, symptoms of nighttime bruxism (jaw soreness or headache in the morning), and any past or present use of mouth orthotics. Since behavioral and occupational factors play a role in TMD, a thorough history includes questions about the patient's occupation, hobbies, and personal habits, such as usual posture, nail biting, or frequent gum chewing. A basic screening for symptoms of depression or anxiety is also necessary, including questions about any recent stressful events. (See <a href=\"#H242703351\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1713551742\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1372548290\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following physical examination findings, taken in conjunction with compelling symptoms of TMD, support the diagnosis of TMD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal mandibular movements</strong> &ndash; Observe opening and closing of the mouth, with attention to any jaw or dental protrusion. Check to see if the upper teeth and lower teeth are aligned. Look for jaw deviation on opening and closing. Abnormal mandibular movements have an overall sensitivity of 4 to 92 percent and specificity for TMD of 8 to 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased range of motion of temporomandibular joint (TMJ)</strong> &ndash; Measure functional range of motion of jaw opening. Normal functional opening is 35 to 55 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/17,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,58</a>]. The functional opening in patients with TMD is typically less than 25 mm and very often associated with pain on active movement and passive stretching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscles of mastication tenderness</strong> &ndash; Palpate the TMJ and muscles of mastication (masseter, temporalis, medial and lateral pterygoids), assessing for muscle tenderness, joint crepitus, or jaw click during opening and closing. Note, however, that joint crepitus or jaw click has an overall sensitivity of 2 to 89 percent and specificity for TMD of 14 to 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Pain elicited on palpation of the TMJ and muscles of mastication has an overall sensitivity of 17 to 100 percent and specificity for TMD of 2 to 91 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pain with dynamic loading</strong> &ndash; To elicit pain with dynamic loading, have patient bite on a cotton roll or grasp the mandible on both sides, pressing down and back to compress the TMJ bilaterally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bruxism</strong> &ndash; Examine the oral cavity and dentition, looking for signs of tooth wear. This exam may be done by the patient's dentist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postural asymmetry</strong> &ndash; Observe upper body posture, assessing for slouching or a preference to lean to one side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neck and shoulder muscle tenderness</strong> &ndash; Inspect and palpate the muscles of the anterior and posterior neck and shoulders, assessing for muscle tension, tenderness, or trigger points.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal cranial nerves examination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7810856\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging of the temporomandibular joint and the maxillofacial skeleton in patients with suspected TMD remains controversial. The most common and helpful diagnostic study is imaging with panoramic radiography of the jaws.

Our management approach outlined below is based upon the limited available data and clinical expertise. We suggest a combined approach using nonpharmacologic (patient education and self-care,) and pharmacologic therapy, when indicated, which often alleviates the symptoms completely or reduces the impact on the patient. Biobehavioral management or occlusal splints may be indicated in certain patients. Muscle trigger point injections and intra-articular temporomandibular joint (TMJ) injections may also have a therapeutic role in some cases.</p><p>Surgery is only considered if there is persistent pain and functional limitations in patients with structural anatomic pathology or TMJ intra-articular disorders that do not respond to a reasonable course (at least three to six months) of nonsurgical interventions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6356317\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1165515331\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonpharmacologic management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment typically includes patient education (about avoiding triggers, nature of the condition, and rationale for treatment) and self-care aimed at improving pain and function from TMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Individuals with TMD are counseled on changing head posture, sleeping position, and parafunctional oral behaviors (eg, nail biting, pen chewing) if these factors contribute to their TMD symptoms.

In one trial, 117 patients were randomly assigned to usual care (patient education, physical therapy, medications, and occlusal splints) versus a tailored self-care program (education, guided reading with feedback, relaxation and stress management training, self-monitoring of symptoms, individualized TMD self-care plan, supervised reinforcement of jaw exercises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82044\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82044 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58921\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58921 \">picture 2</a>), and maintenance and relapse prevention) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. After four months, there was a significantly greater decrease in mean pain intensity score (0 to 10 scale) from baseline in the self-care group (-2.5 versus -1.1 points in the usual care group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. At one year, there were no differences between the two groups.

In a meta-analysis of 17 trials evaluating psychosocial interventions (eg, CBT, biofeedback) compared with other forms of treatment (pharmacologic, physical therapy), there was a small but significant improvement in long-term pain intensity (seven trials) and depression (six trials), favoring psychosocial interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Patients in which the diagnosis is unclear (bruxism versus a sleep disorder) should be evaluated with a sleep study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-abnormal-movements-during-sleep#H428531800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of abnormal movements during sleep&quot;, section on 'Sleep-related bruxism'</a>.)</p><p>TMD patients with nighttime bruxism were traditionally fitted for occlusal splints (removable, usually rigid dental plates that reduce tooth grinding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. A 2012 meta-analysis of 11 studies showed that the use of splints reduced pain from TMD (mean change on the 100 mm visual analog scale = -11.5 mm, 95% CI -16.5 to -6.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

These agents have some utility in many chronic pain disorders, particularly myofascial pain disorders, however, there is insufficient evidence for their efficacy in treating chronic TMD and a scarcity of high-quality randomized controlled trials evaluating their efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>We typically suggest a brief 10- to 14-day course of NSAIDs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 250 to 500 mg twice daily). The longer-acting NSAIDs are generally well tolerated with good patient compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. For patients with pain on palpation of the muscles of mastication, in addition to NSAIDs, we typically prescribe a short course of a centrally-acting skeletal muscle relaxant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a> 10 mg at bedtime or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metaxalone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metaxalone</a> 800 mg three times a day if daytime use is preferred).

Nortriptyline and doxepin seem to be better tolerated with fewer side effects than other tricyclic antidepressants, again increasing patient compliance. If patients with TMD have been pain-free for several months, then reevaluate the need for treatment with the tricyclic.

TMD generally affects more women than men, non-Hispanic Caucasians, and those between the ages of 18 and 44. There is an association between TMD and psychiatric comorbidities, which also impact the prognosis of TMD.

Although there is a structural component to TMD, biologic, behavioral, environmental, and cognitive factors all play a role in the development of symptoms. These can include a history of TMJ trauma, differences in pain perception, comorbid mood symptoms, and head and neck posture. (See <a href=\"#H1713551750\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presenting signs and symptoms of TMD are acute or chronic facial pain triggered by jaw motion, dysfunction of the masticatory system, TMJ tenderness, and neck stiffness and pain. Headache and ear discomfort are also common presenting symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H242703351\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TMD is based on the history and findings on physical examination. A history of facial pain, pain with jaw function, limitation of jaw movement, and cracking or popping noise with jaw function are all typical of TMD. Physical examination findings that characterize TMD are: facial or jaw tenderness, limited mouth opening, and TMJ noises with function. (See <a href=\"#H26338311\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of TMD is extensive. Other causes of facial pain, ear discomfort, headache, and jaw and TMJ dysfunction need to be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H1372548275\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with TMD require a combined approach using nonpharmacologic (patient education and self-care) and pharmacologic therapy, when indicated, which often alleviates the symptoms completely or reduces their impact. In addition, patients with comorbid mood disorders need to be identified and treated for their psychiatric illness. (See <a href=\"#H26338376\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the initial nonpharmacologic management of adults with TMD pain, we suggest patient education and self-care (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1165515331\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biobehavioral management and occlusal splints can be useful adjunctive treatments in certain individuals with TMD. We do not refer patients for routine physical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H611222194\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the initial pharmacologic management of adults with TMD pain, we suggest a 10- to 14-day course of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) as an adjunct to nonpharmacologic management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with pain on palpation of the muscles of mastication, we suggest a 10- to 14-day course of a muscle relaxant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a>) used in conjunction with the NSAID (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1332354260\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If NSAIDs and muscle relaxants are not effective, we suggest adding a tricyclic antidepressant for up to four months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Long-term use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H1332354260\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the management of refractory TMD in patients with persistent pain or functional limitations who have structural pathology causing symptoms that do not respond to more than three to six months of initial management, we suggest surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Surgical procedures include arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, open arthrotomy, and combined joint and reconstructive jaw procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1165515339\" class=\"local\">'Refractory TMD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most individuals with TMD respond to treatment; however, a small portion of patients develop chronic TMD. The risk factors for development of persistent TMD are unknown. (See <a href=\"#H1713551773\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS).
