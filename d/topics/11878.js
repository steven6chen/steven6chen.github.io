These agents reduce the signs and symptoms of inflammation and exhibit a broad range of pharmacologic activities, including analgesic, antipyretic, and antiplatelet properties. Aspirin is most commonly used for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by taking advantage of its antiplatelet properties. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-mechanism-of-action-major-toxicities-and-use-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin: Mechanism of action, major toxicities, and use in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a>, along with P2Y<sub>12</sub> platelet inhibitors, statins, and control of modifiable risk factors, is a key component of strategies to improve CVD outcomes in patients with and without CVD. When used for secondary prevention, antiplatelet therapies reduce nonfatal CVD events by approximately one-fourth and reduce fatal events by approximately one-sixth. Given the importance of aspirin in preventive strategies, failure of aspirin to achieve its potential benefit in patients at risk for CVD events is an important clinical issue. This topic will address issues of aspirin nonresponse and resistance and apparent treatment failure for patients taking aspirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresponse-and-resistance-to-aspirin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Platelets are activated by multiple pathways, and thrombotic event occurrence is influenced by multiple factors in addition to platelet activation and aggregation. Therefore, a single antiplatelet treatment strategy directed against a specific receptor cannot be expected to overcome all thrombotic event occurrences. Treatment failure (occurrence of an ischemic event) during single antiplatelet therapy is not synonymous with antiplatelet resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> <strong>resistance or nonresponsiveness </strong>is a laboratory phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresponse-and-resistance-to-aspirin/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The identification of resistance or nonresponsiveness should therefore utilize a laboratory technique that detects the activity of the target receptor before and after administration of the specific antiplatelet agent.

Using a definition based upon the degree of platelet aggregation after addition of the platelet agonists adenosine diphosphate and arachidonic acid, &quot;aspirin resistance&quot; was present in 17 patients (5.2 percent).

For patients with evidence of either, the clinician needs to have a discussion with the patient about adherence. Ex vivo arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was studied in a case series of 203 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who reported compliance with aspirin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresponse-and-resistance-to-aspirin/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Aspirin &quot;resistance&quot; was noted in seven patients (3.4 percent), all of whom later admitted to being aspirin non-compliant when told of the test results. All seven were found to be aspirin sensitive after in-hospital supervised administration of 325 mg of aspirin. Overall, only one patient in the total group of 223 patients with coronary artery disease (0.4 percent) was truly aspirin &quot;resistant.&quot;</p><p>Similar results were noted in a second case series of consecutive patients undergoing coronary stenting and receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> at a dose of 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresponse-and-resistance-to-aspirin/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One month after hospital discharge, 19 of the 136 patients (14 percent) were identified as nonresponders to arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation. After controlled administration of aspirin, all except one became responders and were identified as patients with nonadherence rather than biological resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437013703\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of enteric-coated aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteric-coated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is sometimes administered instead of non-enteric-coated aspirin (ie, dispersible or immediate-release aspirin) to prevent or reduce gastrointestinal toxicity. Delayed absorption may result in an insufficient antithrombotic effect, especially in the acute setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity#H2603523184\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;, section on 'Enteric-coated and buffered aspirin'</a>.)</p><p>A series of 400 volunteers were screened for their response to a single oral dose of 325 mg immediate-release or enteric-coated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, as determined by several in vitro tests of platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresponse-and-resistance-to-aspirin/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Individuals who appeared &quot;aspirin resistant&quot; underwent repeat testing, and those who continued to appear &quot;resistant&quot; received one week of low-dose enteric-coated aspirin (81 mg). While there was a high frequency of apparent resistance to a single dose of 325 mg enteric-coated aspirin (up to 49 percent), this was not the case with immediate-release aspirin (0 percent). All except one individual who initially did not respond to enteric-coated aspirin subsequently did respond to one of the following: re-exposure, serial dosing with enteric-coated aspirin, change to non-enteric-coated aspirin, or addition of aspirin to their platelets ex vivo. The individual who did not respond to aspirin re-exposure and extension of the post-dosing interval also showed resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, which inhibits platelets by a separate mechanism, suggesting a more general platelet abnormality in this subject. The authors concluded that pharmacologic resistance to aspirin is rare; this study failed to identify a single case of true drug resistance. Pseudoresistance, reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption, complicates enteric-coated, but not immediate-release, aspirin administration.</p><p>Thus, for acute events, non-enteric-coated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is necessary to achieve a rapid clinical antithrombotic effect. In addition, evidence in patients with stable coronary artery disease and apparently healthy volunteers suggests that the 81 mg dose of enteric-coated aspirin may have reduced clinical efficacy in the acute setting. If enteric-coated aspirin is the only available preparation, the tablet(s) should be crushed or chewed to provide an appropriate dose (ideally 325 mg). With respect to chronic administration, the totality of evidence is incomplete but suggestive that doses higher than 81 mg may be necessary if the aspirin is enteric-coated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonresponse-and-resistance-to-aspirin/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].

Aspirin nonresponsiveness was defined as a level of residual serum thromboxane B2 associated with elevated thrombotic risk within 72 hours after three daily aspirin doses.
