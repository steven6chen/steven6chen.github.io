That dilutes the amount of sodium in their blood.</p><p>Sodium is one of many substances called &quot;electrolytes&quot; that help carry electrical signals between cells. That's important because many cells rely on electrical signals to work right. Sodium also helps keep the right amount of fluid inside cells.</p><p>Symptoms of hyponatremia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion or trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak or tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling restless or irritable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness, spasms or cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures or passing out</p><p/><p>Hyponatremia can also cause more serious problems, such as brain swelling and nerve damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109592448\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes hyponatremia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia happens when the body holds onto too much water.
