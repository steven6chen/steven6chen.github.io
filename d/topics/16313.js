The frequency decreases with increasing gestational age. The incidence of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in clinically recognized pregnancies up to 20 gestational weeks is 8 to 20 percent. However, the incidence among women who have previously had a child is much lower (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The overall risk of spontaneous abortion after 15 weeks is low (about 0.6 percent) for chromosomally and structurally normal fetuses, but varies according to maternal age and ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Loss of unrecognized or subclinical pregnancies is even higher, occurring in 13 to 26 percent of all pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7</a>]. Early pregnancy losses are unlikely to be recognized unless daily pregnancy tests are performed. A study that compared women's bleeding following a pregnancy loss before 6 weeks of gestation with their typical menstruation found that mean bleeding length following a pregnancy loss was 0.4 days longer than the woman's average menses and the amount of bleeding was light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>These data derive from studies such as the following representative examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a classic study in which daily urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays were performed, the total rate of pregnancy loss after implantation was 31 percent; 70 percent of losses (22 percent of all pregnancies) occurred before the pregnancy was detected clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, daily urinary hCG assays were performed on 518 nulliparous, newly married women aged 20 to 34 years who were attempting to conceive and had no known infertility factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The mechanism responsible is unknown, but may relate to the vasoconstrictive and antimetabolic effects of tobacco smoke.

Women planning pregnancy should avoid alcohol consumption because alcohol is a known teratogen and a safe level of alcohol intake has not been established for any stage of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alcohol intake and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Substance misuse in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cocaine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of cocaine is associated with preterm birth, and may also be a risk factor for spontaneous abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one study involving 400 women having had a spontaneous abortion and 570 controls who reached at least 22 weeks of gestation, the presence of cocaine in hair samples was independently associated with an increase in the prevalence of spontaneous abortion after adjustment for demographic and drug-use variables (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.0-2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The postulated mechanism is that prostaglandin inhibitors interfere with the role prostaglandins play in implantation, thus potentially leading to abnormal implantation and pregnancy failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

However, studies examining the question have methodologic limitations relating to selection and recall bias, confounding factors, the difficulty of quantifying caffeine consumption accurately (ie, variations in size of the cup, brand of coffee, and brewing method), and the failure to account for fetal karyotype, differences in caffeine metabolism, uncertainties in the time of fetal demise, and the possibility that any effect of caffeine may be gestational age-specific. The mechanism responsible for an association between high levels of caffeine intake and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion may relate to differences in maternal metabolism and clearance.

Whether or not <em>MTHFR</em> polymorphisms independently increase the risk of pregnancy loss is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Results of the study were consistent with that hypothesis: fevers were significantly more prevalent among women having a euploid abortion than among controls (18 versus 7 percent), but not more prevalent among women with aneuploid abortions. Moreover, the risk of abortion related to the proximity of the febrile episode; the OR for abortion was 6.0 when fever occurred in the same calendar month, 3.3 when it occurred during the preceding month, and 1.4 when the febrile episode was two or more months before a euploid abortion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Another study analyzed data from more than 24,000 Danish women who were interviewed during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy to obtain information on the number of febrile episodes, the highest temperature, duration of fever, and gestational age at the time of the occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], which was subsequently linked with a pregnancy outcome registry.

Because the subjects were enrolled late in the first trimester and with sonographically confirmed fetal cardiac activity, women with very early bleeding that went on to miscarry had already been excluded.
