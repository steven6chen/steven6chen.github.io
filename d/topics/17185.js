Once the patient is euthyroid, the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> can be decreased by 30 to 50 percent. Thyroid tests (TSH, free T4) should be repeated four to six weeks after each dose adjustment. A typical maintenance dose of methimazole is 5 to 10 mg daily. When a stable maintenance dose is achieved, thyroid tests (TSH, free T4) can be performed every six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is important to measure both serum free T4 and total T3 because serum T3 concentrations may remain high even though serum free T4 concentrations become normal. The serum T3-to-T4 ratio is particularly high in Graves' hyperthyroidism, and patients with so-called &quot;T3-predominant&quot; Graves' disease may respond less well to thionamide therapy and are less likely to attain prolonged remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A few patients taking a thionamide have high serum T3 concentrations in association with low serum free T4 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Pituitary TSH production is suppressed by hyperthyroidism, an effect that can persist for several months after serum T4 and T3 concentrations become normal. As a result, serum TSH concentrations are often low despite normal or even low serum T4 and T3 concentrations during the first several months of treatment. Often, however, the serum TSH concentration rises into the normal range within a few weeks. When this happens, there is no longer a need to measure serum T3 concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The importance of maintaining a biochemical euthyroid state in patients taking thionamides is suggested by a study that demonstrated increased all-cause mortality during treatment with thionamides (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61) and after radioiodine while still hyperthyroid (SMR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.46) but not after achieving hypothyroidism following radioiodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects</strong> &ndash; Controversy exists as to the value of monitoring white blood cell counts. We do not routinely monitor white blood cell count (for the development of agranulocytosis) or liver function tests (for the development of hepatotoxicity) in patients taking thionamides. However, a complete blood count (white count with differential) should be obtained during any febrile illness and at the onset of pharyngitis. We advise patients taking a thionamide to discontinue the drug at the earliest sign of a fever, sore throat, or other infection until the result of the white blood cell count is available. Agranulocytosis is discussed in detail separately.

Thionamides can be discontinued if TRAbs and TSH are normal at 12 to 18 months. Persistently high levels of TRAbs are associated with high relapse rates, and patients with elevated antibody levels should either be continued on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> or elect definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1090206230\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation prior to stopping therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients require monitoring for recurrence of hyperthyroidism after discontinuation of thionamides, but it typically occurs months to years after drug cessation in patients whose TRAbs are normal at the time the thionamide is stopped. We measure serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 initially at two- to three-month intervals beginning two to three months after stopping treatment (earlier if the patient has hyperthyroid symptoms). Using this approach, recurrent biochemical hyperthyroidism is usually detected before the patient develops many symptoms of hyperthyroidism. If thyroid tests remain normal for six months, monitoring should occur at four- to six-month intervals for the next six months and then every 6 to 12 months. For patients who remain euthyroid for a year, thyroid testing (TSH) can be performed annually. (See <a href=\"#H3243113977\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with recurrent hyperthyroidism after a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>, we suggest definitive therapy (radioiodine or thyroidectomy) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, long-term methimazole is an option for those who prefer to avoid definitive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H773058148\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of prolonged remission among patients treated with a thionamide for one to two years varies from 15 to 80 percent but is usually under 40 percent and is more likely in patients with milder disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Remission'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Cooper DS.
