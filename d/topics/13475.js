The highest concentration of peroxisomes is in the liver and kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although they are not present in mature erythrocytes, they are present during the early stages of erythrocyte development when membranes are formed.</p><p>Peroxisomes catalyze numerous catabolic and anabolic functions in cellular metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Catalytic functions include beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA); oxidation of pipecolic, phytanic, pristanic, and many dicarboxylic acids; and degradation of hydrogen peroxide by catalase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Anabolic functions include synthesis of bile acids and plasmalogens, which are important components of cell membranes and myelin.</p><p>Peroxisomal disorders are a heterogeneous group of inborn errors of metabolism that result in impairment of peroxisome function. In most cases, this results in neurologic dysfunction of varying extent. The major peroxisomal disorders will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of adrenoleukodystrophy are discussed separately.

In ZSD patients, there is a generalized loss of peroxisomal functions, caused by molecular defects in genes coding for peroxins (Pex), proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These defects interfere with import of proteins into the peroxisome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In RCDP1, peroxisomes are present, but they lack a specific group of proteins due to mutations in the <em>PEX7</em> gene.

In one study, among 1000 patients with inborn errors of metabolism seen between 1982 and 1997 at the hospital Necker&ndash;Enfants Malades in Paris, peroxisomal disorders accounted for 2.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most common peroxisomal disorder and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenoleukodystrophy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenoleukodystrophy&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Zellweger syndrome is the most common peroxisomal disorder to present in early infancy. The incidence is 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peroxisomes catalyze numerous catabolic and anabolic functions in cellular metabolism. Catalytic functions include beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA); oxidation of pipecolic, phytanic, pristanic, and many dicarboxylic acids; and degradation of hydrogen peroxide by catalase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Anabolic functions include synthesis of bile acids and plasmalogens, which are important components of cell membranes and myelin.</p><p>One of the hallmarks of most peroxisomal disorders is the abnormal elevation of VLCFA, especially those with 26 carbon atoms, and an increased ratio of C26 to C22 fatty acids in the plasma, as well as fibroblasts and amniocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Accumulation of VLCFA in the membranes of neuronal cells contributes to neurologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. VLCFA accumulation impairs erythrocyte membrane structure and function and the capacity of cultured adrenal cells to respond to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and impairs the stability of model membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Of note, VLCFA levels are normal in some of the peroxisomal disorders. This applies to rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (where deficiency of plasmalogens is the principal biochemical abnormality) and to Refsum disease (where accumulation of phytanic acid contributes to pathogenesis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of disease in these conditions is thought to be accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in neuronal membranes, resulting in abnormal function, atrophy, and death of vulnerable cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Studies in an animal model of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) provide evidence that the neuronal migration defect is due to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The neuropathology of peroxisomal disorders is characterized by one or more of the following processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Migration and differentiation defects</strong> &ndash; Disorders of neuronal migration and differentiation vary in severity among the different disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Migration of all neuronal classes appears to be affected, especially those destined for the outer layers of cortex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The abnormalities are most prominent in ZWS and ZWS-like disorders, including D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency, which are characterized by a unique combination of centrosylvian pachygyria-polymicrogyria likely responsible for the seizure disorder and mental retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Less severe defects in cerebral migration, usually polymicrogyria, occur in neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD) as diffuse, focal or multifocal lesions that may be associated with subcortical heterotopias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These also occur in DBP deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. More subtle neuronal migration defects appear as heterotopic Purkinje cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These are usually asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neuronal migration abnormalities do not occur in all peroxisomal disorders. None have been identified in IRD, classic Refsum disease, acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency (pseudo-NALD), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), or adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). They occur rarely in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctate (RCDP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Defects in neuronal differentiation or terminal migration are common and result in dysplasia and simplification of the affected structures in ZWS. In the brainstem, they usually involve the principal nuclei of the inferior medullary olives. Less frequently, the dentate nuclei and claustra are affected. Neuronal loss may be seen in NALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The type of neuronal degeneration varies among the disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myelination abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Abnormalities in the formation or maintenance of central white matter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral nerve myelin are frequently found in patients affected by peroxisomal disorders with neurologic involvement. Peripheral nerve involvement is less well studied than central lesions. An exception is Refsum disease, which typically has a hypertrophic (onion bulb) demyelinating neuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Degenerative central white matter lesions consist of myelin abnormalities that can be inflammatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] or noninflammatory, and nonspecific decreases in myelin volume or staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The latter can occur with or without reactive astrocytosis. The type of neuronal degeneration varies among the disorders:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Inflammatory demyelination</strong> &ndash; Inflammatory demyelination typically occurs in ALD, resulting in confluent and bilaterally symmetric loss of myelin in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The parieto-occipital regions are usually affected first, with asymmetric progression of the lesions toward the frontal or temporal lobes. In general, arcuate fibers are spared, except in chronic cases. Axonal loss may be considerable, but myelin loss is usually greater. Lesions may sometimes involve the brainstem, especially the pons. The spinal cord is usually spared, except for bilateral corticospinal tract degeneration. In mice engineered to be deficient in peroxisomal function, axonal degeneration, progressive demyelination, and an inflammatory response with both B and T cells was noted, suggesting a critical role for peroxisomes in neuroprotection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">When peripheral nerves are affected in X-ALD, characteristic lamellar and lamellar-lipid inclusions are seen in Schwann cell cytoplasm or within endoneurial macrophages. The neuropathology of X-ALD is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenoleukodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenoleukodystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Other conditions in which inflammatory demyelination lesions occur include AMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], NALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and some cases of DBP deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Non-inflammatory dysmyelination</strong> &ndash; Noninflammatory dysmyelination is seen in the early stages of AMN. The myelin appears pale, with scant interstitial macrophages that stain positive with periodic acid Schiff (PAS). No lymphocytes or reactive astrocytes are seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Other changes in myelin</strong> &ndash; Other changes in myelin include nonspecific reductions in volume or staining, with or without reactive astrocytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Major postdevelopmental noninflammatory abnormalities may occur in specific neurons or myelinated fiber tracts. These may affect specialized sensory neurons, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss (in ZWS, NALD, infantile Refsum disease [IRD], alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase [AMACR] deficiency, RCDP, and acyl CoA oxidase deficiency) or retinal pigmentary degeneration (in ZWS, NALD, IRD, and AMACR deficiency). In another lesion of this type, neurons of the dorsal nuclei of Clarke and the lateral cuneate nuclei accumulate lamellar lipids that contain VLCFA. This lesion occurs only in ZWS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In AMN, a degenerative axonopathy involves the ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord, especially in fasciculus gracilis and the lateral corticospinal tracts. The histologic pattern is Wallerian degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Mitochondrial pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] also contribute to pathogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Cerebellar atrophy occurs in RCDP and probably IRD. This appears to result from loss of Purkinje and granule cells, with focal depletion of basket cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The features that should prompt consideration of a peroxisomal disorder in the differential diagnosis are discussed in this section. The clinical features of individual peroxisomal disorders are discussed in greater detail below.</p><p>The clinical presentation of peroxisomal disorders varies with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/10,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,33</a>]. In one review of 27 children with peroxisomal disorders, the following clinical features suggested the diagnosis at various ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates &ndash; Hypotonia, decreased activity, encephalopathy, seizures, craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal abnormalities (calcific stippling, shortened proximal limbs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children &lt;6 months of age &ndash; Craniofacial dysmorphism, failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, prolonged jaundice, neurologic dysfunction, visual abnormalities (retinopathy, cataract, optic nerve dysplasia, abnormal electroretinography [ERG] or visual evoked potential), liver failure, hypocholesterolemia, osteoporosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children six months to four years &ndash; Psychomotor retardation, neurologic dysfunction, hearing loss, abnormal brain auditory evoked potential, visual abnormalities (visual impairment, retinopathy, cataract, abnormal ERG), osteoporosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children more than four years &ndash; Behavioral changes, intellectual deterioration, visual abnormalities, hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, gait abnormalities, white matter demyelination.</p><p/><p>In another review of 40 patients, the combination of certain clinical features suggested the diagnosis (&ge;3 features present in more than 75 percent of patients <strong>and</strong> at least one feature present in 50 to 75 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Features present in more than 75 percent of patients &ndash; Psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, impaired hearing, <span class=\"nowrap\">low/broad</span> nasal bridge, abnormal ERG, hepatomegaly in the first year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Features present in 50 to 75 percent of patients &ndash; Large fontanelle, shallow orbital ridges, epicanthus, anteverted nostrils, retinitis pigmentosa.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747827\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before addressing the individual disorders, considering a common approach to diagnosis is useful. If a peroxisomal disorder is suspected, plasma concentration of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) should be measured. VLCFA levels are elevated in nearly all peroxisomal disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Disorders of peroxisome biogenesis can be distinguished from peroxisomal beta-oxidation defects by additional measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The tests are available in specialized laboratories, including the Peroxisomal Disease Laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (707 North Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205) and the Genetic Metabolic Diseases Laboratory at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam.</p><p>The following plasma concentrations should be measured:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dihydroxy and trihydroxy cholestanoic acid (increased in most disorders of peroxisome biogenesis, as well as D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency, and sterol carrier protein X (SCPx) deficiency).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phytanic acid (increased in many disorders of peroxisome biogenesis and in Refsum disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pristanic acid (increased in many disorders of peroxisome biogenesis, and in DBP, AMACR deficiency, and SCPx deficiency).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pipecolic acid (increased in many disorders of peroxisome biogenesis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Docosahexaenoic acid (moderately diminished in many disorders of peroxisome biogenesis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasmalogens (decreased in many disorders of peroxisome biogenesis and in the three genetic forms of RCDP).</p><p/><p>Of note, these tests are not always abnormal early in the course of disorders of peroxisome biogenesis (eg, Zellweger spectrum disorders [ZSD]). One report described six patients with clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggestive of relatively mild infantile peroxisomal defects, in whom plasma VLCFAs and other tests of peroxisomal dysfunction were normal or only mildly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The initial MRI abnormalities were in the hilus of the dentate nucleus, and gradually progressed to demyelination of the cerebral hemispheric white matter. A peroxisomal disorder was ultimately diagnosed through tests of catalase immunofluorescence in cultured skin fibroblasts, which are described in the paragraph below.</p><p>Assays of the following processes in cultured skin fibroblasts may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>De novo plasmalogen biosynthesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatty acid beta-oxidation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phytanic acid alpha-oxidation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catalase-immunofluorescence</p><p/><p>DNA analysis is available for all peroxisomal diseases including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and is the preferred method for the identification of women who are heterozygous for X-ALD, because it avoids the false negative results that may occur with the VLCFA assay in heterozygotes. DNA is required for the definition of the molecular defect in the disorders of peroxisome biogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], and D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal testing for all of the peroxisomal disorders is available for subsequent pregnancies of women with affected children or other positive family history. Prenatal diagnostic methods have generally shifted from biochemical to DNA-based methods. Using assisted reproductive technology, preimplantation diagnosis can be achieved in embryos using multiple displacement amplification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Issues related to preimplantation genetic diagnosis are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antenatal diagnosis is sometimes made by ultrasonography. In one report, increased nuchal translucency and decreased fetal movements suggested the diagnosis of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) in a fetus at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The range of foods allowed has gradually broadened to include many green vegetables because the free phytol content is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Strict reduction in dietary phytanic acid intake may be associated with a significant improvement in both the peripheral neuropathy and ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In a series of 13 adult patients with Refsum disease treated with dietary therapy for 10 years or more, phytanic acid levels declined by almost 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Phytanic acid levels were normalized (&lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in 30 percent of the participants, partially normalized (30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in 50 percent, and remained elevated (&gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in 15 percent, to some extent reflecting compliance with dietary restriction. None of the participants required plasmapheresis or admission for acute symptoms of Refsum disease.</p><p>Phytanic acid concentration can also be reduced by plasmapheresis, which is used when rapid reduction is required, and can be performed serially if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Plasmapheresis efficiently removes phytanic acid associated with lipoproteins but does not efficiently deplete phytanic acid in adipose and neural tissue. This approach halts progression of the disease, but does not completely reverse neurologic abnormalities. Ichthyosis, sensory neuropathy, and ataxia resolve in approximately that order, and ECG abnormalities may improve. However, treatment may not affect retinitis pigmentosa, hearing impairment, or anosmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other disorders in which only one peroxisomal enzyme is deficient have each been described in a few children.

Importantly, a different ACOX catalyzes the first step in the oxidation of pristanic acid and di- and tri-hydroxycholestanoic acid. The gene is localized on chromosome 17q25.</p><p>Patients with acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency show a variety of clinical symptoms including neonatal hypotonia (92 percent), seizures (91 percent), failure to thrive (38 percent), visual system failure (78 percent), impaired hearing (77 percent), loss of motor achievements (83 percent), hepatomegaly (50 percent), and external dysmorphism (50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peroxisomal-disorders/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. White matter abnormalities are present in all patients. All patients had psychomotor retardation but acquired limited skills, such as sitting and standing unsupported for a few seconds, voluntary control of hand function, and the use of a few words with comprehension of their meaning. The mean age of death is five years, with the oldest patients surviving until 10 years of age.</p><p>Deficiency of ACOX results in increased plasma concentration of VLCFAs and normal levels for pristanic acid and the bile acid intermediates.

They host numerous catabolic and anabolic pathways that are essential to normal cellular metabolism. Peroxisomal disorders are a heterogeneous group of inborn errors of metabolism that result in impairment of peroxisome function. In most cases, this results in neurologic dysfunction of varying extent.
