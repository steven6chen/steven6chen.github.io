This topic will review the more common viral infections that can cause arthritic symptoms. An overview of pathogenesis and diagnosis of viral arthritis is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-viral-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and diagnosis of viral arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS A VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections, arthralgias and rash occur in 10 to 14 percent of patients, but arthritis is extremely rare and there is some suspicion that patients with arthritis attributed to HAV infection truly had hepatitis C (HCV). Arthritis has been described primarily in patients with vasculitis who had a chronic relapsing form of hepatitis A, and also high titer of polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG)- and IgM-circulating cryoglobulins (type III cryoglobulinemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS B VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be either asymptomatic or symptomatic. Asymptomatic infection is more common than the latter, especially in young children. Most primary infections in adults are self-limited, with clearance of the virus from the blood and liver and the development of lasting immunity to reinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, some primary infections in healthy adults, generally less than 5 percent, do not resolve, but develop into persistent infections. This is manifested by serological evidence of a primary infection by the appearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), followed shortly by IgM antibodies against HBV core antigen (anti-HBc antibodies); then circulating HBeAg becomes detectable.</p><p>Clinically, a prodromal phase of one to six months is followed by the onset of nonspecific symptoms including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain, which generally precedes the onset of icterus by 1 to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In such cases, viral replication continues in the liver and there is continued viremia, although the titers of the virus in the liver and blood are variable.</p><p>People with subclinical persistent infection, normal serum aminotransferase levels, and nearly normal findings on liver biopsy are termed asymptomatic chronic HBV carriers; those with abnormal liver function and histologic features are classified as having chronic hepatitis B. During the prodromal phase and the early phase of clinical disease, HBsAg may be evident in the circulation. Only later does anti-HBsAg appear with a subsequent clearance of circulating viral products. Joint symptoms associated with HBV infections are believed to be due to the formation and deposition of immune complexes; cryoprecipitates containing HBsAg and complement components have been reported in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Affected patients may have an earlier anti-HBsAg response, promoting immune complex formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Ten to 25 percent of patients with HBV develop joint symptoms and arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It can be symmetrical, migratory, or additive, and arthritis usually occurs in the prodromal stage of the disease at a time when there may be no other clinical manifestations of hepatitis. Women have a higher incidence than men. The joints of the hands and knees are most often affected, but wrists, ankles, elbows, shoulders, and other large joints can also be affected and morning stiffness is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. Joint symptoms tend to persist for days to weeks, and commonly resolve with the onset of jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Skin involvement is a common accompaniment of HBV-associated arthritis and often appears coincident with the joint symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Urticarial and maculopapular eruptions primarily involving the lower extremities are most typical.</p><p>The patients with acute hepatitis B-associated arthritis may have abnormal liver function tests with transient decreases in complement levels, and increasing levels of circulating immune complexes. The diagnosis of HBV infection must be confirmed by serological evidence of viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. In individuals with chronic HBV infection, arthritis may persist for longer periods of time and other laboratory and clinical manifestations of immune complex-mediated disease may be present. These include evidence of clinical syndromes such as polyarteritis nodosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and essential mixed cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Examination of joint fluid may reveal inflammatory changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Management is limited to symptomatic supportive care. The joint disease is always self-limited with no reports of progression to chronic arthritis or evidence of joint damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS C VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of persistent viral infection. It is often discovered in an asymptomatic individual because of elevated transaminase levels noted on comprehensive metabolic panel. Many infected patients have extrahepatic symptoms, including arthralgias and myalgias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A significant number of patients with HCV infection demonstrate an antibody response to viral products that result in the formation of circulating immune complexes. These immune complexes may then deposit in tissues producing the clinical manifestation of mixed essential cryoglobulinemia that includes arthritis, glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Arthritis is noted in 2 to 20 percent of HCV patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. The arthritis is an evanescent rheumatoid-like picture in two-thirds of the cases and an oligoarthritis in the rest. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> may be helpful, but conventional treatment of arthritis may be problematic in the context of viral hepatitic arthropathy. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors appear relatively safe when used to treat patients with HCV and an associated rheumatoid arthritis-like disorder, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Glucocorticoids should be avoided if possible in these patients. The emergence of more effective antiviral treatments and the combination with biologics may provide more effective treatment for the inflammatory arthritis associated with chronic HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PARVOVIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parvovirus B19 is the only known parvovirus that infects humans. It is the cause of fifth disease or erythema infectiosum, a self-limited febrile-rash producing disease of childhood. Infections can also cause arthralgias or arthritis. A B19 infection can also present as a nonspecific febrile illness with a connective tissue disease-like syndrome, both in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>This syndrome is manifested by rash, <span class=\"nowrap\">arthralgias/arthritis,</span> laboratory abnormalities, and other connective tissue disease-like symptoms. Parvoviral infections sometimes mimic systemic lupus (SLE) in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]; a role for B19 infection in the pathogenesis of SLE has been proposed by some authors, but remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. B19 infections can also cause severe catastrophic illness with life threatening aplastic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Nonarticular manifestations of parvoviral infection are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Joint symptoms occur in about 8 percent of infected children and 60 percent of infected adults. Arthralgias or arthritis may accompany or follow the skin eruption. Arthropathy occurs more commonly in women (59 percent) than in men (30 percent), with many adults having arthritis alone without other preceding or concurrent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. A typical pattern in adults is acute onset symmetrical polyarticular arthritis with the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints most commonly affected. In children, the arthropathy can be asymmetric and oligoarticular, affecting the knees most often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Arthralgias are more frequent than actual joint swelling, although both may occur. Joint stiffness is common. The joint symptoms may persist for weeks to occasionally months with resolution, but recurrences are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>At times, children may meet criteria for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A child's anti-B19 antibodies may cross-react with other antigens, leading to autoantibody formation and immune complex deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Parvovirus B19 does not appear to be a specific cause of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are not more likely to be seropositive for parvovirus than are controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Conversely, B19 arthropathy does not progress to rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Parvovirus B19 DNA may be present in inflamed joints, but is also found in equivalent proportion of control samples of synovial tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, in an animal model, the transfer of a parvovirus B19 genetic element encoding a nonstructural protein conferred susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis in an otherwise arthritis-resistant strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of acute parvovirus infection is made by finding circulating IgM antibody to parvovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody is evidence of a preexisting infection and may be found in a substantial proportion of the normal population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. Laboratory findings are otherwise remarkably normal in most patients. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are occasionally elevated. The leukocyte count remains normal, but rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody may be present during the acute period in some cases, although their presence may be transient in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Therapy for acute parvoviral infections with <span class=\"nowrap\">arthralgias/arthritis</span> is mainly supportive, with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> in doses of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in children and 500 mg twice a day in adults usually effective for symptomatic relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RUBELLA AND RUBELLA VACCINE VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rubella virus infection classically presents with acute maculopapular rash accompanied by significant lymphadenopathy involving the posterior auricular, posterior cervical, and suboccipital lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The rash is light pink, beginning as a maculopapular eruption on the face and spreading to involve the trunk, hands, and feet, while sparing the palms and soles. Rubella vaccine virus and an attenuated strain of viral-type rubella virus rarely give rise to rash, fever, or lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rubella\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rubella&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both rubella and rubella vaccine virus are believed to grow preferentially in synovial tissues, giving rise to symptoms because of direct infection. Both rubella and rubella vaccine virus have been cultured from joint tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Rubella virus has been shown to persist in lymphocytes recovered from people infected years earlier, thereby providing a mechanism for subsequent viral infection of the joint tissues or for production of viral products that could give rise to an immune complex-mediated pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/30,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34,35</a>].</p><p>Rubella and rubella vaccine virus are associated with a high incidence of associated arthritis; in one report, as high as 30 percent of females and 6 percent of males with rubella infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The onset of joint symptoms due to rubella virus is typically abrupt, occurring in most patients within a one-week period before and after the rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Joint symptoms usually develop approximately two weeks after vaccination with rubella virus vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. One study also showed that the risk of arthropathy following rubella vaccination may be higher in women who have very low pre-vaccine levels of antibody, particularly in assays measuring functional (neutralizing) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The pattern of joint involvement with both viruses is similar to that in rheumatic fever being symmetrical, migratory, and additive, with resolution of most joint symptoms within two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39,40</a>]. The small joints of the hands, wrists, and knees are most commonly involved, with the larger joints less often affected. Arthralgias are much more common than true joint swelling; however, there is often considerable pain and swelling in the soft tissues surrounding the joint as well as synovial tendon sheath involvement, occasionally leading to tenosynovitis and the carpal tunnel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39,40</a>]. Joint symptoms may on rare occasions persist for long periods of time, as long as a year. However, there is no evidence of chronic joint disease or joint damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Recurrence of joint symptoms, although uncommon, is seen more frequently after rubella vaccine virus inoculation, occurring in approximately 1.3 percent of the patients with joint symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of rubella-associated arthropathy must be substantiated by either viral isolation from the nasopharynx or joint tissues, or serological evidence of an acute viral infection with an IgM response. Joint fluid findings are consistent with an inflammatory arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/32,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,42</a>]. Management is entirely symptomatic and supportive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ALPHAVIRUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alphaviruses that cause <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgias</span> are globally distributed mosquito-borne RNA viruses causing epidemics of <span class=\"nowrap\">polyarthritis/arthralgia,</span> with disease emerging or reemerging and increasingly being reported in travelers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. They are maintained in nature by continuous cycles of transmission between hematophagous arthropods (usually mosquitoes) and enzootic vertebrate hosts (usually mammals or birds). Bites by infected mosquitoes can result in epizootic infections of humans, with most cases occurring after seasonal rains when mosquito numbers are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Diseases caused by the African and Asian arthritogenic alphaviruses have not been extensively studied because they largely occur in underdeveloped and developing countries, where they often do not represent a major health priority; however, Ross River virus disease, which affects as many as 8000 Australians annually, has received considerable attention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ross-river-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ross River virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among all of the viruses that can cause arthritis, the alphaviruses are unusual, because nearly all symptomatic infections in adults result in joint symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. There are six genus of alphaviruses in the family Togaviridae, representing a group of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA arboviruses, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus, which is also found in Australia and causes about 500 to 1500 symptomatic infections per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second group is Igbo-Ora, a virus related to O'nyong-nyong and found mainly in Africa, with an outbreak in 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third group consists of the Sindbis virus group, which is found in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and the Sindbis-like viruses, which occur more frequently in Europe. It goes by different names of Karelian fever in Russia, Ockelbo in Sweden, and Pogosta in Finland.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fourth group is Mayaro, which is found mainly in South America, and has small sporadic epidemics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fifth group is O'nyong-nyong, which is found in Central and East Africa with occasionally small epidemics; however, greater than two million people were involved in an epidemic from 1959 to 1962.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The last group is Chikungunya, found mainly in South and East Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific, with recurrent epidemics with as many as 40,000 involved Thailand in 1962 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. In late 2013, Chikungunya fever was reported in the Caribbean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]; subsequently, local transmission was confirmed in many countries and territories in the Caribbean and in North, Central, and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/46,48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48-52</a>]. Musculoskeletal manifestations of Chikungunya fever are described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chikungunya-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chikungunya fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The mechanism by which these viruses give rise to joint symptoms is mainly caused by virus persisting in synovial macrophages, with the host's inflammatory antiviral immune response giving rise to the arthritic symptoms. Virus has been detected in the joint effusions of Ross River virus patients, and Ross River virus can establish in vitro persistent productive infection in macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. These macrophage cultures also secrete inflammatory mediators associated with macrophage recruitment and activation, specifically chemokines, interleukin (IL)-8, and the antiviral cytokine interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Similar findings have been found in Barmah Forest virus, Chikungunya, Semliki Forest, and Sindbis viruses. T-cell derived interferon gamma is also involved in Ross River virus disease and other alphaviruses. Interferon gamma has been detected in the synovial exudate from Ross River virus patients, and interferon gamma-secreting Ross River virus-specific T-cells from humans and mice have been isolated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The incubation period lasts from several days to three weeks. Infection is typically associated with triad of fever, arthritis, and rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; however, all aspects of the triad may not be present, making the diagnosis difficult at times. The symptomatic to asymptomatic ratio varies from 4:1 to 1:1 between O'nyong-nyong, Mayaro, and Ross River virus.</p><p>In children, the disease is often clinically indistinguishable from other febrile illnesses and is usually mild with Ross River virus. The onset in Chikungunya and O'nyong-nyong viruses is abrupt with fever and joint symptoms and can be severe in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The other alphaviruses are associated with a more gradual onset of fever and nonspecific constitutional symptoms prior to joint involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Most patients have polyarthralgias, usually involving the feet, ankles, knees, lower back, fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neck. Approximately one-third to one-half often experience rash, fever, myalgias, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fatigue, with tendinitis and periarticular involvement also being present at times. In most cases, symptoms progressively resolve over an average of a three- to six-month period, although the Ross River virus has appeared to last longer than one year in the occasional patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>] and 12 percent of those with Chikungunya had chronic arthralgia lasting more than three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The rash occurs several days after the onset of joint symptoms and is short-lived, involving the face, trunk, and flexor surface of the extremities. Mild lymphadenopathy may be seen with all of the viral types.</p><p>Chikungunya has become a much more global disease with increasing world travel and global warming, with increasing arthritic symptoms including large outbreaks in Italy, India, and Indian Ocean islands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. A 2005 to 2006 outbreak in Reunion Island showed younger patients recovered, but a chronic group developed, mainly in patients over 60 years of age. These patients had a much higher viral load. A rapid innate immune response was demonstrated by an increase in <span class=\"nowrap\">dendritic/NK/CD4/CD8</span> cell activation and accompanied by a weak <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> cytokine response.

There is a strong association of HLA-B27 with pustular psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in HIV patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p>Treatment is the same as in non-HIV infected patients with psoriatic arthritis. Though NSAIDs are generally used as initial treatment for HIV-associated psoriatic arthritis, these agents are often ineffective in controlling the disease and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [5 to 10 mg once weekly], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> [1 to 2 gm daily]) have been used with success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. There is a case report of successful use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil in HIV-associated psoriatic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Psoralen and pulsed ultraviolet light therapy may be effective for both the skin and joint manifestations.</p><p>Anti-TNF agents may be beneficial. One study evaluated eight HIV patients with various rheumatic diseases, including three with psoriatic arthritis, who received anti-TNF agents. All patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>. All three patients with PsA went on to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> and two also received infliximab after failing the other two anti-TNF agents. Both patients had excellent responses to infliximab. The side effect profile was overall good, except one patient had transient elevation of the viral RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS), a condition which resembles Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, is seen in 3 to 4 percent of HIV patients. There is massive parotid enlargement secondary to the lymphocytic infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. DILS has been seen in all stages of HIV disease irrespective of CD4 counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/98,100,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,100,123</a>]. In addition to the parotid gland swelling, patients often complain of dry mouth, dry eyes, and arthralgia. There may be extraglandular lymphocytic infiltration in the liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, thymus, and nervous system, leading to hepatitis, renal tubular acidosis, lymphoma, polymyositis, interstitial pneumonitis, and peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of DILS has diminished since the introduction of potent ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p>On liver biopsy, extensive CD8 lymphocytic infiltration is seen. HIV patients with DILS differ from patients with idiopathic Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome in that more males than females have been reported with DILS and they tend to be less than 40 years of age. African American patients are more affected. These patients have generalized lymphadenopathy with massive parotid swelling, and there is more extraglandular involvement than in idiopathic Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. Patients with DILS tend to be negative for the rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-SSA or anti-SSB antibodies, and though they may have arthralgias, they usually do not have arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. These patients tend to have a slower progression to AIDS, possibly due to suppressed HIV viral replication by the CD8+ lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of DILS may be a host immune response associated with HLA-DR5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. Samples from 17 patients (15 males and 2 females) with HIV with moderate to massive bilateral parotid gland swelling showed all patients had polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and were found to have CD8 T cell infiltration both in the salivary glands as well as extraglandular tissue. The <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> ratio was less than one, and there was an increased ratio of CD4+CD29+ cells to CD4+CD45R+ cells.</p><p>Therapy for DILS is mostly symptomatic, with sialogogues two to three times daily for xerostomia and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> for xerophthalmia. These patients are prone to recurrent middle ear, sinus, and oral infections. Thus, careful physical examination and appropriate and timely antibiotics are needed. Corticosteroids are transiently effective for glandular swelling and sicca symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Immunosuppressive therapy is reserved for extraglandular involvement, particularly pulmonary or renal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10996779\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though untreated HIV patients may have multiple antibodies on serologic evaluation, including RF, anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), cryoglobulins, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, they are rarely of clinical significance. RF and ACPA are found in up to 47 and 15 percent of untreated HIV patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. ANA has been found in 17 to 23 percent of HIV patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. These antibodies are of low titer and speckled pattern. Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and lupus anticoagulant are reported to be in as high as 94 and 46 percent of untreated HIV patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/128,129\" class=\"abstract_t\">128,129</a>].

In the early stages of immune reconstitution there is an increase in CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, the CD4+ T cell:CD8+ T cell ratio, and cytokines, especially IL-6, TNF alpha, IFN gamma, and IL-17, leading to IRIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/137,138\" class=\"abstract_t\">137,138</a>]. IRIS is categorized as either unmasking or paradoxical IRIS.</p><p>AIDS patients on ART who develop highly inflammatory reactions to occult infections, such as tuberculosis, because of reconstitution of their immune system are considered to have unmasking IRIS. If the patient has clinical recrudescence of a successfully treated infection with sterile cultures, there is antigen-driven immune reactivation and the patient is said to have paradoxical IRIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].</p><p>New autoimmune or inflammatory disease or flares of preexisting disease, such as sarcoidosis or rheumatoid arthritis-like illnesses, have been reported in association with reconstitution of T cell-mediated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. Other autoimmune diseases reported include discoid lupus erythematosus, myositis, Grave&rsquo;s disease, Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, and adult-onset Still&rsquo;s disease. The main risk factors for the development of IRIS are: 1) low baseline CD4+ T cell count (&lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microliter)</span> at time of initiation of ART; 2) significant lowering of viral load (&gt;2 log drop in HIV-1 RNA at 90 days) secondary to ART; 3) high antigenic load of an opportunistic infection; and 4) initiation of ART very soon after an opportunistic infection. The average time to IRIS symptoms after initiation of ART is nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. Most cases of IRIS are self-limited and require minimal therapy.

In hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections, arthralgias and rash occur in 10 to 14 percent of patients, but arthritis is extremely rare. Ten to 25 percent of patients with hepatitis B (HBV) develop joint symptoms, often with a rash, and a symmetrical, migratory, or additive arthritis, usually during the prodromal stage of the disease. Joint symptoms tend to persist for days to weeks and resolve with the onset of jaundice. Chronic HBV infection may be associated with more persistent arthritis and other immune complex disorders, such as polyarteritis nodosa, glomerulonephritis, and essential mixed cryoglobulinemia.<br/><br/>Arthritis is noted in 2 to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C (HCV). The arthritis is an evanescent, rheumatoid-like picture in two-thirds of the cases and an oligoarthritis in the rest. Some patients with chronic HCV infection may develop mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis with associated arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis A virus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis B virus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis C virus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human parvovirus B19, the cause of fifth disease or erythema infectiosum, can also cause arthralgias or arthritis. Joint symptoms occur in about 8 percent of infected children and 60 percent of infected adults. Arthralgias or arthritis may accompany or follow the skin eruption. A typical pattern in adults is acute onset symmetrical polyarticular arthritis with the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints most commonly affected. In children, the arthropathy can be asymmetric and oligoarticular, affecting the knees most often; arthralgias are more frequent than actual joint swelling. The joint symptoms may persist for weeks to occasionally months with resolution, but recurrences are reported. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Parvovirus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rubella and rubella vaccine virus are associated with arthritis. The incidence of arthritis with rubella infection is up to 30 percent of females and 6 percent of males. The onset of joint symptoms due to rubella virus is typically abrupt, occurring in most patients within a one-week period before and after the rash. Joint symptoms usually develop approximately two weeks after vaccination with rubella virus vaccine. Joint involvement is similar to that in rheumatic fever being symmetrical, migratory, and additive, with resolution of most joint symptoms within two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Rubella and rubella vaccine virus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alphaviruses that cause <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgias</span> are globally distributed mosquito-borne RNA viruses causing epidemics of <span class=\"nowrap\">polyarthritis/arthralgia,</span> with disease emerging or reemerging and increasingly being reported in travelers. A number of agents have been implicated, including Ross River virus, Chikungunya, and others. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Alphaviruses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic findings of dengue virus infection are an acute febrile illness with headaches and marked muscle and joint pain, sometimes described as &quot;break-bone fever.&quot; Arthralgias occur in 60 to 80 percent of patients.

Joint symptoms commonly accompany some episodes of illnesses associated with fever, myalgias, evanescent rash, and constitutional symptoms, which are presumed due to enterovirus infection. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Enterovirus infections: Coxsackie virus and Echovirus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthralgias are the most common joint manifestation of Epstein-Barr viral infection, with occasional large joint swelling, and arthrocentesis may reveal an inflammatory joint fluid; the joint signs and symptoms are self-limited.
