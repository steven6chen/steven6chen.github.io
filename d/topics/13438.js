Although the name &quot;perioral dermatitis&quot; suggests a primarily eczematous condition, POD most often resembles an acneiform or rosacea-like eruption with or without associated features of a mild eczematous dermatitis. The pathogenesis of POD is poorly understood; both intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors, such as irritants and topical corticosteroids, may contribute to this disorder. Topical anti-inflammatory agents and topical or systemic antibiotics constitute the major pharmacologic options for therapy.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of POD will be discussed here. The differential diagnosis of disorders that present with inflammation of facial skin is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-facial-erythema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with facial erythema&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2875928\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioral dermatitis (POD) was first described in 1957 under the moniker &quot;light sensitive seborrheid&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since then, an association with light exposure has largely been discounted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In 1964, &quot;perioral dermatitis&quot; was introduced as the preferred term to refer to this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some authors have advocated for utilization of the term &quot;periorificial dermatitis,&quot; a name that reflects the various potential sites of POD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5544626\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5544605\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioral dermatitis (POD) occurs worldwide and in individuals of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Although women between the ages of 16 and 45 constitute the vast majority of patients affected by POD, POD may also occur in older individuals, men, and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>Childhood POD often occurs in young children. A retrospective study of 222 children with POD seen at an academic dermatology department found an average age of presentation of 6.6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. POD may develop in infants as young as three months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Girls may be slightly more likely to develop POD than boys. In a retrospective study, 46 of 79 children and adolescents with POD (58 percent) were female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5544612\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathways that lead to the development of perioral dermatitis (POD) are not well understood. Deficiencies in skin barrier function and features of atopy have been detected at increased frequency in patients with POD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Although it is conceivable that these factors could augment the risk for persistent cutaneous inflammation after to exposures to external irritants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], a definitive role for skin barrier dysfunction and atopic diatheses in POD has not been established.</p><p>Topical corticosteroid use is frequently reported in association with POD, with the classic history being a papular and slightly scaly facial eruption that initially improves with topical corticosteroid use, but recurs or worsens with continued use or attempts to discontinue corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/2,5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,13,14</a>]. Whether topical corticosteroids are capable of inducing POD during treatment of unrelated facial dermatoses or whether they may simply exacerbate preexisting POD remains uncertain. Reports vary widely on the proportion of patients who recount a history of topical corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/2,5,11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,11,15,16</a>]. </p><p>Despite the uncertainty in the specific role of corticosteroids in POD, there appears to be a connection between POD and topical corticosteroid use, particularly with potent formulations. There is an impression that fluorinated topical corticosteroids are particularly likely to contribute to POD, which may be related to their high potencies, rather than a specific effect of fluorination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/2,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,18</a>]. Further support for a contributory role of corticosteroids arises from reports of POD that developed after the administration of oral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] or inhaled corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>The reason for an association between POD and corticosteroids remains unclear. Some authors have suggested that corticosteroid-induced damage to the epidermal barrier may be a contributing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In addition to topical corticosteroids, several other factors have been proposed as potential contributors to POD, including fluoridated toothpaste, skin moisturizers and cosmetic products, fusobacteria, <em>Candida albicans</em>, hormonal fluctuations in women, and oral contraceptive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/2,3,13,23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,13,23-28</a>]. Whether these factors truly contribute to the development of POD is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5544626\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioral dermatitis (POD) typically manifests as multiple 1 to 2 mm clustered erythematous papules, papulovesicles, or papulopustules with or without mild scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60390%7EDERM%2F64577%7EDERM%2F73223%7EDERM%2F63864%7EDERM%2F62705%7EDERM%2F50527%7EDERM%2F65367%7EPC%2F73779\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60390 graphicRef64577 graphicRef73223 graphicRef63864 graphicRef62705 graphicRef50527 graphicRef65367 graphicRef73779 \">picture 1A-H</a>). In some patients, features consistent with a mild eczematous dermatitis also are present. Occasionally, the eczematous component is prominent. </p><p>The inflammatory papules and scaling of POD occur most frequently in the perioral region, but a narrow zone around the vermilion border of the lip is usually spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Less often, the perinasal and periorbital areas are sites of significant involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F51230%7EDERM%2F70512\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51230 graphicRef70512 \">picture 2A-B</a>). In a retrospective study of 79 children and adolescents with POD, perioral, perinasal, or periocular lesions were present in 70, 43, and 25 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Lesions in these classic locations may also be accompanied by lesions in other areas, such as the cheeks, chin, forehead, and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>POD may be asymptomatic or may be accompanied by mild to moderate stinging or burning sensations in the affected areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The skin lesions usually resolve without scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17210921\"><span class=\"h2\">Granulomatous periorificial dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulomatous periorificial dermatitis represents a clinical variant of POD that typically occurs in prepubescent children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. The term Afro-Caribbean childhood eruption has also been used to describe this condition in black children. Children typically develop numerous small, flesh-colored, red-brown, or yellow-brown inflammatory papules in perioral, perinasal, or periocular areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50340 \">picture 3</a>). Papulopustules and papulovesicles are typically absent, and occasionally, sites other than the face are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599784\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POD is generally considered a benign and self-limited disorder. In some patients, POD resolves within a few months without pharmacologic therapy, while in others, the disorder may persist for several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Topical corticosteroid use may contribute to the chronicity of POD. Although improvement may be noted early in the course of corticosteroid treatment, continued use may perpetuate or exacerbate the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1586608\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5544633\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of perioral dermatitis (POD) can usually be made via assessment of the patient history and recognition of the classic clinical features. The presence of multiple small inflammatory papules, papulovesicles, or papulopustules clustered on the perioral, perinasal, or periocular skin suggests this diagnosis. The following additional findings also support a diagnosis of POD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sparing of the skin immediately adjacent to the vermilion border of the lip</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coexisting features of eczematous dermatitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or stinging sensations </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent use of topical, nasal, or inhaled corticosteroids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of disease flares after topical corticosteroid withdrawal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of comedones (comedones are a manifestation of acne vulgaris)</p><p/><p>Skin biopsies rarely are necessary, but can be used to differentiate POD from other disorders when the diagnosis is uncertain. The histopathologic findings of POD are nonspecific and vary with the type of lesion biopsied: scaling, eczematous-appearing areas show parakeratosis, epidermal spongiosis, and mild acanthosis, and biopsies of papules typically exhibit perifollicular and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Biopsies taken from lesions of granulomatous periorificial dermatitis demonstrate epithelioid granulomas that resemble those found in granulomatous rosacea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-facial-erythema#H402950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with facial erythema&quot;, section on 'Biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2149662\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Granulomatous rosacea'</a>.)</p><p>Serologic studies are not useful for confirming a diagnosis of POD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5544661\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple other skin disorders may present with inflammatory eruptions around the mouth, nose, or eyes. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acne vulgaris </strong>&ndash; Acne vulgaris is a common disorder that manifests as comedones and inflammatory papules or pustules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70809%7EPC%2F80536\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70809 graphicRef80536 \">picture 4A-B</a>). Although the detection of comedones on the skin supports a diagnosis of acne vulgaris, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis (POD) may coexist. Unlike acne vulgaris, scarring is uncommon in POD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations and classification'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rosacea </strong>&ndash; Papulopustular rosacea presents with inflammatory papules and pustules that are primarily distributed on the central face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67890\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67890 \">picture 5</a>). Centrofacial erythema and telangiectasias may also be present. A predilection for the cheeks rather than periorificial sites suggests a diagnosis of papulopustular rosacea. In the absence of other findings consistent with rosacea, lesions of granulomatous rosacea may be impossible to distinguish from granulomatous periorificial dermatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Seborrheic dermatitis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Seborrheic dermatitis is a common inflammatory condition that frequently presents with erythema and scale involving the perinasal skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59104 \">picture 6</a>). Scaling macules and patches are typically present. In contrast to POD, small papules are not a typical feature of seborrheic dermatitis and a perioral distribution is unusual in seborrheic dermatitis. The detection of seborrheic dermatitis in other commonly affected sites, such as the scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and chest, can be useful for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seborrheic-dermatitis-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seborrheic dermatitis in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic contact dermatitis </strong>&ndash; Allergic contact dermatitis is a manifestation of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to agents that come in contact with the skin. Patients may present with inflammatory papules, vesicles, weeping, or crusting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67215\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67215 \">picture 7</a>). The distribution of lesions is dependent upon the specific sites of contact with the inciting agent. Unlike POD, intense pruritus is usually present, scale is often prominent, and lesions fail to improve with antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Irritant contact dermatitis </strong>&ndash; The clinical findings of irritant contact dermatitis vary based upon the nature of the external insult and site of involvement. Papules, vesicles, scale, erythema, or edema may be seen. Unlike allergic contact dermatitis, but similar to POD, a burning sensation, rather than pruritus, is often the predominating symptom. The patient history is of value for identifying this diagnosis. As an example, irritant dermatitis related to chronic lip-licking behavior can resemble POD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54887\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54887 \">picture 8</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dermatitis-eczema#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Irritant contact dermatitis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impetigo </strong>&ndash; Impetigo is a common staphylococcal or streptococcal skin infection that most frequently occurs in children. The perinasal skin is a common site for involvement. Erosions, vesicles, and yellow crusts may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82281\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82281 \">picture 9</a>). Scaling and acne-like papules are uncommon. Gram stains and bacterial cultures can be used to confirm this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=impetigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Impetigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dermatophyte infections</strong> &ndash; Tinea corporis and tinea barbae may present with inflammatory papules or pustules on the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78234\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78234 \">picture 10</a>). Unlike POD, dermatophyte infections almost always have an asymmetrical distribution. A potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH) is useful for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatophyte-tinea-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatophyte (tinea) infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Less common causes of facial lesions that may exhibit features suggestive of POD include <em>Demodex </em>folliculitis, which can demonstrate numerous <em>Demodex</em> mites on KOH preparation, lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei (which may represent a variant of rosacea) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56241\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56241 \">picture 11</a>), Gram-negative folliculitis, and eosinophilic folliculitis with or without associated human immunodeficiency virus infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54404\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54404 \">picture 12</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3579734\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioral dermatitis (POD) may resolve within a few months without pharmacologic therapy if topical corticosteroid use is discontinued and other potentially exacerbating factors are eliminated. However, since the appearance of the skin lesions is frequently distressing for patients and the disease course is variable, patients often desire intervention to reduce the duration of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H599784\" class=\"local\">'Disease course'</a> above.) </p><p>Data on the topical and systemic treatment options for POD are limited. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a>, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> are the agents with the greatest evidence for efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1586608\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our general approach to adults and children with POD involves the discontinuation of topical corticosteroids and the avoidance of skin care products and cosmetics that may irritate or occlude the skin. This approach, which is also referred to as &quot;zero therapy,&quot; is supported by the observation that many vehicle or placebo-treated patients in randomized trials have improved within two to three months without active therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/12,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,39,40</a>]. </p><p>In an attempt to accelerate clinical improvement, we usually also prescribe pharmacologic therapy. For children and adults with mild to moderate eruptions (the presence of several or more lesions that do not cause the patient significant emotional distress), we typically initiate therapy with a topical agent due to the relatively low risk for drug-induced systemic adverse effects. We favor topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a>, as this agent has the most evidence in support of its efficacy. However, the expense of this drug is sometimes a limiting factor. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> are less expensive options for therapy. </p><p>For patients who present with moderate to severe POD (numerous papules, large areas of confluent involvement, bothersome symptoms, or significantly emotionally distressing POD) or milder disease that is refractory to topical therapy, we favor the use of oral tetracyclines as initial therapy. In children under the age of nine, tetracyclines are contraindicated; oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> is the preferred systemic agent for these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3031816557\"><span class=\"h2\">Elimination of corticosteroids and irritants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the cessation of topical corticosteroids is well accepted as an important component of management, patients typically become distressed when disease flares occur following the cessation of corticosteroid therapy. Some clinicians attempt to reduce the likelihood of a rebound flare by either transitioning patients utilizing high- or medium-potency topical corticosteroids to low-potency agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 1%, or slowly tapering the frequency of corticosteroid application prior to treatment cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/3,6,8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,8,16</a>]. The benefit of these techniques is unproven. </p><p>An effort to eliminate potential skin irritants typically involves cleansing the skin with water alone and limiting the use of topical products on the face to the occasional &quot;only as needed&quot; application of a bland, nonocclusive moisturizing lotion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/8,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24</a>]. However, such extensive avoidance of cosmetic and skin care products is not feasible for all patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H850368\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line topical pharmacologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the topical agents prescribed for POD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a> 1% cream has the most data in support of its efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/12,39,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,39,41,42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H850471\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical calcineurin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pimecrolimus</a> 1% cream is a topical calcineurin inhibitor. In a multicenter randomized trial in which 124 adults were treated for up to four weeks with twice daily applications of pimecrolimus 1% cream or a vehicle cream, pimecrolimus therapy was associated with more rapid improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioral-periorificial-dermatitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After eight days, greater than 50 percent reductions in disease severity scores occurred in 24 of 60 patients in the pimecrolimus group (40 percent) and only 7 of 64 patients in the vehicle group (11 percent). In addition, the median time to response was 14 versus 28 days. Patients with a history of topical corticosteroid use appeared to respond best to pimecrolimus.
