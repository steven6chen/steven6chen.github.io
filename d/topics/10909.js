They account for 30 to 40 percent of all hand fractures. This topic will review issues related to metacarpal head fractures, which are usually the result of direct trauma.</p><p>This topic will review issues related to metacarpal head fractures. A general overview of metacarpal fractures is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-metacarpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of metacarpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metacarpal heads articulate with their corresponding phalanx. Thus, a fracture of the head is, by definition, an intraarticular fracture. The heads of the metacarpals are bulbous and &quot;cam&quot; shaped, thereby permitting adduction, abduction, flexion, extension and passive rotation of the fingers. The collateral ligaments join the metacarpal to the proximal phalanx and are taut in flexion, while having some laxity in extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65855 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the metacarpal heads are relatively rare and usually result from a direct blow, crush, or missile injury. The second metacarpal (ray of index finger) is most commonly involved, and the first metacarpal head (ray of thumb) is rarely fractured. In some patients, rupture of the collateral ligaments by torsional valgus or varus stress can result in avulsion fractures at the metacarpal head.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prominent swelling, decreased range of motion, and tenderness is found at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Axial load to the MCP joint worsens pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rotational alignment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even small rotational deformities can produce significant disability. Rotational alignment should be carefully assessed with the MCP joint in flexion. The rotational alignment of the metacarpals can be assessed in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a semi-clenched fist (flexion to 90 degrees at the MCP and proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joints), normal alignment will enable each finger to point toward the scaphoid pole and show convergence of the digits but not necessarily to a single point (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73269%7EEM%2F71612\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73269 graphicRef71612 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the MCP joint flexed 90 degrees and the PIP and distal interphalangeal [DIP] joints in full extension, the plane of the fingernails should be aligned and can be compared with the contralateral side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52326\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52326 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin integrity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Special attention must be paid to skin integrity near the metacarpal head since this site is particularly prone to injury caused by a tooth during an altercation and are accordingly known as &quot;fight bites.&quot; Any evidence of laceration or skin breakdown requires aggressive decontamination to avoid potentially disastrous intraarticular infections. Prophylactic antibiotics appear to be beneficial with hand bites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard hand series (anteroposterior [AP], lateral, and oblique views) should be ordered if a metacarpal head fracture is suspected. Metacarpal head fractures often are significantly comminuted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51598\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51598 \">image 1</a>) and may occur in conjunction with metacarpal neck fractures.</p><p>If a collateral ligament avulsion fracture is suspected but not visualized on standard views, a Brewerton view (metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joint flexed at 65 degrees with the proximal phalanx flat on the cassette and the beam directed 15 degrees ulnar) can be helpful. If plain films do not adequately assess the metacarpal heads, non-contrast computed tomography [CT] is the imaging study of choice to further define this injury. Magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] is helpful for the evaluation of soft-tissue injuries, but CT is superior for the evaluation of bony anatomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most metacarpal head fractures require referral because they are intraarticular and typically comminuted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-head-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If the fragments are small and multiple, non-operative management may be considered, but consultation should be sought before pursuing this approach. Any rotational deformity requires correction. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rotational alignment'</a> above.)</p><p>Small avulsion fractures caused by collateral ligament injuries can be treated non-operatively if the fragment is small and displaced no more than 3 mm. These injuries can be treated appropriately by the measures outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following discussion describes the initial therapeutic approach in patients who do not require immediate fracture reduction or orthopedic referral as described in the previous section. Splinting is used in the initial immobilization of, and sometimes is the definitive treatment for, metacarpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-head-fractures/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. A detailed description of the techniques for applying splints is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cast and splint care (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute management of metacarpal head fractures involves use of an ulnar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65376\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65376 \">picture 3</a>) or radial gutter splint (metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joints in 70 to 90 degrees of flexion, wrist in 20 to 30 degrees extension, proximal and distal interphalangeal joints in 5 to 10 degrees of flexion) or a bulky hand dressing in a position of function. Ulnar gutter splints are used for fourth and fifth metacarpal head fractures, while radial gutter splints are used for injuries to the second and third metacarpals. Icing and elevation are employed during in the first 48 to 72 hours to minimize swelling. Metacarpal head fractures should be followed-up within one week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-displaced metacarpal head fractures typically are immobilized for two to three weeks using a gutter splint prior to initiation of range of motion exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-head-fractures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Prolonged immobilization is avoided in order to prevent chronic stiffness, which is the most common complication of non-displaced metacarpal head fractures. Repeat radiographs should be performed at one week and at the time immobilization is completed (two to three weeks). If fragments displace at any time, orthopedic referral is indicated.</p><p>While joint stiffness due to scarring of the ligamentous structures is a common complication, avascular necrosis (AVN) is the most significant morbidity associated with fractures of the metacarpal head. AVN occurs more often in displaced or horizontal fractures. We suggest obtaining radiographs one year following injury or if the patient is experiencing any suggestive symptoms to rule out AVN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-head-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Return to active use depends upon the type of activity in which the patient will engage. Advice differs for returning to sports and work.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Athletes should have full, pain-free range of motion and radiographic evidence of healing prior to return to sports. It is important to inform athletes that discontinuation of splinting at two to three weeks to allow range of motion does not mean that the fracture has completely healed. When evidence of bony healing is apparent, athletes can return to play but should wear protective padding or an orthosis for four to six weeks after the initial period of immobilization is complete. They can expect to be out of competition for four to six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients requiring regular use of the fractured hand at work can return to full duty when they have functional range of motion, are pain-free, and non-tender.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metacarpal head fractures are typically intraarticular fractures that occur from crush injury or a direct blow. Avulsion fractures involving the metacarpal head result from torsional, varus, or valgus stress at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.
