Neurosyphilis can occur at any time after initial infection.</p><p>Early in the course of syphilis, the most common forms of neurosyphilis involve the cerebrospinal fluid, meninges, and vasculature (asymptomatic meningitis, symptomatic meningitis, and meningovascular disease). Late in disease, the most common forms involve the brain and spinal cord parenchyma (general paralysis of the insane and tabes dorsalis). Each form has characteristic clinical findings, but in some cases there is overlap between these findings.</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and treatment of neurosyphilis. Other aspects of syphilis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-treatment-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Treatment and monitoring&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurosyphilis begins with invasion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a process that probably occurs shortly after acquisition of <em>T. pallidum</em> infection. The organism can be identified in the CSF from approximately one-quarter of untreated patients with early syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Specific strains of <em>T. pallidum</em> may be more likely to cause neurosyphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Unlike other bacteria that can infect the CSF, invasion of CSF with <em>T. pallidum</em> does not always result in persistent infection, as spontaneous resolution may occur in some cases without an inflammatory response. In other cases, spontaneous resolution may occur after a transient meningitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64295 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Persistent meningitis is the result of failure to clear organisms from the CSF. Patients with persistent meningitis have &quot;asymptomatic neurosyphilis,&quot; and individuals with this form of neurosyphilis are at risk for subsequent forms of symptomatic neurosyphilis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64295 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Studies performed in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century showed that the more abnormal the CSF in asymptomatic meningitis, the more likely that symptomatic neurosyphilis would develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of <em>T. pallidum</em> clearance from CSF is probably similar to the immune response that occurs in peripheral infection, where opsonized organisms are cleared by activated macrophages. Supporting evidence comes from a study of nonhuman primates infected with <em>T. pallidum</em>; the number of CSF CD4+ T cells and the amount of gamma-interferon produced by CSF lymphocytes increased throughout the period of bacterial clearance, consistent with a &quot;Th-1-type&quot; cellular immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurosyphilis was common in the pre-antibiotic era, occurring in 25 to 35 percent of patients with syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Of these, approximately one-third had asymptomatic neurosyphilis, one-third had tabes dorsalis, and at least 10 percent had paresis. Meningovascular syphilis was seen in about 10 percent, with the remaining patients having other forms of neurosyphilis, including symptomatic meningitis and cranial nerve abnormalities.</p><p>In the current era, neurosyphilis is most frequently seen in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This association may simply reflect the fact that syphilis is most common in men who have sex with men, many of whom are HIV-infected, or it may reflect a true difference in susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient#H402717952\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in the HIV-infected patient&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>HIV-infected persons with lower peripheral CD4+ T cell counts are more likely to have symptomatic neurosyphilis than those with higher CD4+ T cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The frequency of the late forms of neurosyphilis (general paresis and tabes dorsalis) has declined in the antibiotic era, with the result that these forms, particularly tabes dorsalis, are now uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Many experts believe that this decline is due, at least in part, to the widespread use of antibiotics for unrelated illnesses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurosyphilis can be classified into early forms and late forms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64295 \">figure 1</a>). The early forms typically affect the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meninges, and vasculature, while the late forms affect the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Most of what we know about the clinical manifestations of neurosyphilis comes from observations made before the advent of penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Early neurosyphilis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic neurosyphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, patients with asymptomatic neurosyphilis have no symptoms or signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease, although they may have evidence of concomitant primary or secondary syphilis. Asymptomatic neurosyphilis can occur within weeks to months after infection, but less commonly occurs more than two years after infection.</p><p>The diagnosis is based on the identification of CSF abnormalities, including a lymphocytic pleocytosis that is typically &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> an elevated protein concentration that is usually &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> a reactive CSF-Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), or a combination of these abnormalities.</p><p>In patients with suspected asymptomatic neurosyphilis who do not have HIV infection, a CSF lymphocyte count &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or a protein concentration &gt;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is consistent with the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Establishing the diagnosis of asymptomatic neurosyphilis in patients who have HIV infection with CSF pleocytosis but nonreactive CSF-VDRL is difficult because mild CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein can be due to HIV itself. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with asymptomatic neurosyphilis, regardless of CSF-VDRL reactivity, should be treated for neurosyphilis to prevent progression to symptomatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most often, symptomatic meningitis occurs within the first year after infection, but it can occur years later. As with asymptomatic neurosyphilis, peripheral findings of early syphilis may coexist, particularly the rash of secondary disease.</p><p>Patients with symptomatic syphilitic meningitis complain of headache, confusion, nausea and vomiting, and stiff neck. Visual acuity may be impaired if there is concomitant uveitis, vitreitis, retinitis, or optic neuropathy. Signs include cranial neuropathies, particularly of the optic, facial, or auditory nerves. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ocular syphilis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Otosyphilis'</a> below.)</p><p>Meningitis may cause hydrocephalus as well as arteritis of small-, medium-, or large-sized vessels, leading to ischemia or infarction of brain or spinal cord. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Meningovascular syphilis'</a> below.)</p><p>Focal meningeal inflammation may lead to diffuse leptomeningitis or to syphilitic gummas, which are focal areas of inflammation that present as mass lesions contiguous with the leptomeninges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64262\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64262 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Meningitis, brain ischemia, or gummas may cause seizures.</p><p>Syphilitic meningitis may uncommonly affect the spinal cord and cause meningomyelitis or hyperplastic pachymeningitis with polyradiculopathy. Symptoms and signs include back pain, sensory loss, incontinence, leg weakness, or muscle atrophy.</p><p>The CSF abnormalities that accompany symptomatic meningitis are more severe than those seen in asymptomatic meningitis. CSF lymphocyte counts are generally between 200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> CSF protein concentration is typically between 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and CSF-VDRL is almost always reactive. Neuroimaging may show enhancement of meninges, spinal fluid, cranial nerves, or spinal roots. Cerebral gummas show focal areas of enhancement adjacent to the meninges, often with a &quot;dural tail,&quot; and surrounding edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64262\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64262 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Ocular syphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular syphilis can involve almost any eye structure, but posterior uveitis and panuveitis are the most common and present with diminished visual acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additional manifestations may include optic neuropathy, interstitial keratitis, anterior uveitis, and retinal vasculitis. Ocular syphilis is often, but not always, accompanied by syphilitic meningitis. Ocular syphilis may worsen when the diagnosis is not considered and patients are treated with systemic or topical corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Reports first published in 2015 suggested that rates of ocular syphilis are increasing in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. A preliminary study found no single or predominant strain of T. <em>pallidum</em> was causing ocular syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Otosyphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing loss, with or without tinnitus, should be considered as part of the neurologic symptoms or signs of neurosyphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Like ocular syphilis, hearing loss may or may not be accompanied by meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Meningovascular syphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other bacterial meningitides, syphilitic meningitis can cause an infectious arteritis that may affect any vessel in the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain or spinal cord and result in thrombosis, ischemia, and infarction. This form of neurosyphilis may present as an ischemic stroke in a young person. Stroke may develop at any time from the first months to the first few years after infection, with an average interval of seven years in a series conducted in the preantibiotic era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Many patients with meningovascular syphilis have prodromal symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, or personality changes, for days or weeks before the onset of ischemia or stroke. These symptoms are probably due to concomitant meningitis.</p><p>The manifestations of cerebral ischemia may be acute or chronic. The neurological deficits reflect the territory of the vessel involved. The middle cerebral artery and its branches are most commonly affected. Less commonly, meningovascular disease affects the anterior spinal artery and thereby causes spinal cord infarction.</p><p>The CSF abnormalities associated with meningovascular neurosyphilis are generally less severe than in those of acute meningitis, with lymphocytic pleocytosis between 10 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and protein concentration of 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. As with all of the early symptomatic forms of neurosyphilis, CSF-VDRL is usually but not always reactive.</p><p>Angiography (performed with computed tomographic, magnetic resonance, or conventional catheter techniques) may demonstrate focal segmental arterial narrowing, focal narrowing and dilatation, or total occlusion, similar to the findings seen in other infectious or noninfectious vasculitides. Neuroimaging shows one or more areas of infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Late neurosyphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General paresis and tabes dorsalis are considered &quot;tertiary&quot; forms of neurosyphilis, while the early forms of neurosyphilis are not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">General paresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General paresis (also known as general paralysis of the insane, paretic neurosyphilis, or dementia paralytica) is a progressive dementing illness. In the pre-penicillin era, general paresis resulted in death within an average of 2.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. General paresis usually develops 10 to 25 years after infection, but it can occur as early as two years after infection. In the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, this form of neurosyphilis accounted for about 10 percent of all admissions to psychiatric hospitals.</p><p>In the early stage of disease, general paresis is associated with symptoms of forgetfulness and personality change. Most affected individuals experience progression of deficits in memory and judgment leading to severe dementia. Less often, patients may develop psychiatric symptoms such as depression, mania, or psychosis. In a study of 116 patients with general paresis in China, dementia, personality change, abnormal behavior, and emotional problems were the most common findings. On initial evaluation, neurosyphilis was not suspected in 36 percent of patients, which delayed the diagnosis for 1 to 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>While the neurologic examination may be normal in some patients with general paresis, common abnormal findings include dysarthria, facial and limb hypotonia, intention tremors of the face, tongue, and hands, and reflex abnormalities. Pupillary abnormalities, including Argyll-Robertson pupils, may also be seen. However, pupillary findings are more typical of tabes dorsalis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Tabes dorsalis'</a> below.)</p><p>CSF abnormalities are the rule in paretic neurosyphilis, with elevated lymphocytes of 25 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and a protein concentration in the range of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. The CSF-VDRL is reactive in virtually all patients, although rare cases with a nonreactive CSF-VDRL have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Neuroimaging most commonly shows atrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Tabes dorsalis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tabes dorsalis (also called locomotor ataxia) is a disease of the posterior columns of the spinal cord and of the dorsal roots. It has the longest latent period between primary infection and onset of symptoms of all forms of neurosyphilis, with the interval averaging about 20 years, but sometimes as few as three years.</p><p>While tabes dorsalis was the most common form of neurosyphilis in the pre-antibiotic era, it is uncommon in the antibiotic era. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The most frequent symptoms of tabes dorsalis are sensory ataxia and lancinating pains. The latter are characterized by sudden, brief, severe stabs of pain that may affect the limbs, back, or face and that may last for minutes or days. Less common symptoms are paresthesia and gastric crises, characterized by recurrent attacks of severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Bladder dysfunction with urinary retention and overflow incontinence may occur early in the course of disease.</p><p>Pupillary irregularities are among the most common signs in patients with tabes dorsalis, and the Argyll-Robertson pupil accounts for approximately one-half of these. An Argyll-Robertson pupil is small, does not respond to light, contracts normally to accommodation and convergence, dilates imperfectly to mydriatics, and does not dilate in response to painful stimuli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tonic-pupil#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tonic pupil&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Other findings seen with tabes dorsalis include absent lower extremity reflexes, impaired vibratory and position sensation, and, less commonly, impaired touch, pain, and optic atrophy.</p><p>The CSF may be completely normal in tabes dorsalis, or may show a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis with 10 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and protein concentrations of 45 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. In this form of neurosyphilis, as many as one-quarter of the CSF-VDRL tests are nonreactive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical neurosyphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies from the antibiotic era have reported &quot;atypical&quot; forms of neurosyphilis, a term that is used to describe neurosyphilis that does not fulfill the clinical criteria for one of the &quot;classic&quot; forms (eg, symptomatic meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, general paresis, and tabes dorsalis). As an example, a study from the early 1970s of 289 patients with reactive serum CSF-FTA-ABS tests reported that neurosyphilis was diagnosed in 241 (84 percent) based on the identification of reflex, sensory, or pupillary changes, or seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, similar cases of neurosyphilis were described in the 1940s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, it is likely that such &quot;atypical&quot; forms of neurosyphilis have always existed.</p><p>That said, several modern case reports have described patients with neurosyphilis that mimicked herpes encephalitis or autoimmune encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. These patients generally had acute onset of cognitive changes, although some patients had more slowly progressive presentations. Many had seizures. Brain MRI showed unilateral or bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F103817\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef103817 \">image 2</a>) characterized by high signal on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, which resolved after treatment for neurosyphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition to mesiotemporal lobe lesions, other reports have observed MRI signal abnormalities in parietal, temporo-occipital, and thalamic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>It is difficult to categorize these cases into one of the classic clinical descriptions of neurosyphilis described above (eg, symptomatic meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, general paresis, tabes dorsalis). While patients with a more slowly progressive course could be considered to have general paresis, those with acute onset and temporal lobe imaging abnormalities present a greater challenge for classification. The features of these cases are most similar to meningovascular syphilis, except that the temporal lobe abnormalities do not respect vascular territories. Thus, it is probably best to describe them as an overlap between meningeal and parenchymal disease, rather than attribute them to one of the classic clinical forms of neurosyphilis. The fact that seizures themselves may cause reversible temporal lobe abnormalities further complicates categorization of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In his 1944 text, Stokes wrote, &quot;The frequency of neurosyphilis in general medical practice depends to a large extent on the thoroughness of the search for signs of neuraxis involvement and the frequency with which the spinal fluid examination is employed&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Furthermore, the CSF-VDRL test may be falsely positive when the CSF is visibly blood-tinged and the serum nontreponemal test titer is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Reports of CSF-VDRL sensitivity and specificity vary depending on how neurosyphilis is defined, but the preponderance of data suggest that the test lacks sensitivity. In a monograph on neurosyphilis published during the 1940s when the disease was common, a nonreactive CSF Wassermann test, the predecessor of the CSF-VDRL, was documented in 8 to 19 percent of patients with early neurosyphilis, including meningitis and meningovasculitis, the forms that are most common today [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a modern-era study of 149 patients with laboratory and clinically defined neurosyphilis, the diagnostic sensitivity of the CSF-VDRL ranged from 67 to 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Because the CSF-VDRL is not available in some areas of the world, the CSF-RPR is sometimes used in its place. The CSF-RPR may be nonreactive in instances where the CSF-VDRL is reactive, making it a less useful test. The CDC syphilis guidelines do not address use of the CSF-RPR for neurosyphilis diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The European guidelines state that the CSF-VDRL is preferred over the CSF-RPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the CSF-VDRL, the CSF FTA-ABS test is sensitive but not specific, particularly in asymptomatic neurosyphilis. In the setting of lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis and a nonreactive CSF-VDRL, a nonreactive CSF-FTA-ABS test excludes the diagnosis of asymptomatic neurosyphilis in most instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Elevation of the CSF protein concentration is consistent with neurosyphilis.

We suggest that failure of the CSF white blood cell (WBC) count to decrease six months after therapy or failure of CSF-VDRL to decline fourfold (or to nonreactive if the initial titer is &lt;1:2) one year after therapy are indications for re-treatment. The CSF white blood cell count should decline by six months after successful treatment, and all CSF abnormalities should resolve by two years after treatment. Failure to meet these criteria should prompt retreatment. Retreatment is also indicated if any follow-up CSF sample shows an increase in CSF white blood cell count, or a fourfold increase in CSF-VDRL titer. CSF abnormalities may normalize more slowly in patients who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection compared with those who are not infected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurosyphilis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Normalization of serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer may predict successful neurosyphilis treatment.

This disorder begins with invasion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a process that probably occurs shortly after acquisition of <em>T. pallidum</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early in the course of syphilis, the most common forms of neurosyphilis involve the CSF, meninges, and vasculature (asymptomatic meningitis, symptomatic meningitis, and meningovascular disease). Later in disease, the most common forms involve the brain and spinal cord parenchyma (general paresis and tabes dorsalis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64295 \">figure 1</a>). In the current era, early neurosyphilis is more common than late neurosyphilis, and is most frequently seen in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic neurosyphilis lacks symptoms or signs of CNS disease, although there may be concomitant evidence of primary or secondary syphilis. Treatment of asymptomatic neurosyphilis prevents progression to the symptomatic forms. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic neurosyphilis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic syphilitic meningitis is typically manifested by headache, confusion, nausea and vomiting, and stiff neck. Visual acuity may be impaired if there is concomitant uveitis, vitreitis, retinitis, or optic neuropathy. Other signs include cranial neuropathies. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic meningitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syphilitic meningitis can cause an infectious arteritis that may affect any vessel in the subarachnoid space and result in thrombosis, ischemia, and stroke involving the brain or spinal cord.

Symptoms of forgetfulness and personality change predominate early on, but progression leads to severe dementia. Common signs include dysarthria, facial and limb hypotonia, intention tremors of the face, tongue, and hands, and reflex abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'General paresis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tabes dorsalis, uncommon in the modern era, is a disease of the posterior columns of the spinal cord and of the dorsal roots. The latent period between primary infection and onset of symptoms averages about 20 years. The most frequent manifestations include sensory ataxia, lancinating pains, and pupillary irregularities. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Tabes dorsalis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis summary</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical suspicion and spinal fluid examination are keys to the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. In the setting of unknown syphilis history, the first step is confirming current or previous infection with <em>T. pallidum</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57300\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57300 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71518\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71518 \">algorithm 2</a>). Serum nontreponemal tests (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] and rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) and serum treponemal tests (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS], treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TPPA], or syphilis enzyme immunoassays [EIAs]) are virtually always reactive in early neurosyphilis. However, the nontreponemal tests may be nonreactive in late neurosyphilis, while the treponemal tests remain reactive. Therefore, serum treponemal tests (FTA-ABS, TPPA, or syphilis EIA) should always be performed when there is suspicion for late forms of neurosyphilis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with known syphilis, we recommend lumbar puncture with CSF examination for those who have neurologic or ocular signs or symptoms, active tertiary syphilis affecting other parts of the body, or treatment failure in any stage of syphilis.
