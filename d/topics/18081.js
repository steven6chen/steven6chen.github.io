Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other agents have supplanted TCAs as first line therapy in the management of depression, TCAs are still used for depression and other indications. Consequently, TCA poisoning, which can be life-threatening, remains a significant clinical issue.</p><p>The diagnosis and management of TCA poisoning is reviewed here. A summary table to facilitate the emergent management of TCA overdose is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64294 \">table 1</a>). The management of SSRI poisoning and a general clinical approach to the patient with known or suspected drug poisoning are discussed separately.

TCAs are lipophilic and thus have a large volume of distribution (Vd). The fraction of the drug found in the plasma is usually highly bound to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. TCAs are primarily metabolized by the liver, undergoing phase one metabolism primarily via CYP 2D6 and phase 2 glucuronidation. Many phase one metabolites are pharmacologically active and may persist in the plasma for 12 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Depending upon the TCA, the half-life of the parent compound can range from 7 to 58 hours. Approximately 70 percent of the total dose is renally excreted as inactive metabolites; the remainder is eliminated primarily via the biliary system, with a small amount excreted unchanged in the urine. Enterohepatic recirculation can delay final elimination of a large fraction of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Important changes make it impossible to extrapolate overdose kinetics from kinetics measured during therapeutic dosing. Absorption may be delayed, largely due to decreased gut motility from anticholinergic effects. Bioavailability may be increased as metabolic pathways become saturated, reducing the first pass metabolism. Acidemia, which frequently complicates overdose, may increase the amount of free drug due to effects on plasma glycoprotein binding. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 resulting in a decreased rate of elimination, may become more relevant following overdose. The sum total of these effects is often delayed absorption, an increased proportion of active drug, and delayed excretion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16889603\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac conduction abnormalities occur during tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) poisoning because TCAs inhibit the fast sodium channels in the His-Purkinje system and myocardium. This inhibition decreases conduction velocity, increases the duration of repolarization, and prolongs absolute refractory periods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61989\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61989 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These effects are similar to those of the Vaughan-Williams Class IA antiarrhythmic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>. Mechanisms that contribute to hypotension during overdose include decreased contractility from reduced calcium influx into ventricular myocytes, blockade of rapid sodium channels, and peripheral vasodilatation from blockade of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In the event of mental status changes, information can be obtained from emergency medical personnel, police, family, friends, pharmacists, psychiatrists, and primary care clinicians. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs of TCA poisoning typically include sedation, but may also include confusion, delirium, or hallucinations. Cardiac conduction delays, arrhythmias, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity (eg, hyperthermia, flushing, dilated pupils) are also common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64294 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/2,3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,9,10</a>]. The clinical course of patients with TCA poisoning can be unpredictable, and patients who present immediately after ingestion may initially be well-appearing, only to deteriorate rapidly, due to the variable absorption kinetics described above. In most cases, acute TCA ingestions of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> lead to significant cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Therefore, obtaining an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately upon presentation is essential in patients with known or suspected TCA poisoning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64294 \">table 1</a>). Arrhythmias from a TCA overdose can develop quickly and ECGs should be obtained frequently until the patient has been free of any symptoms or signs of cardiac toxicity for several hours. We suggest obtaining an ECG approximately every hour, but more frequent studies are needed if the patient manifests signs of cardiotoxicity or conduction abnormalities are evident on the initial ECG or a cardiac monitor.</p><p>The following signs suggest cardiotoxicity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolongation of the QRS &gt;100 msec</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal morphology of the QRS (eg, deep, slurred S wave in leads I and AVL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63490\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63490 \">waveform 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal size and ratio of the R and S waves in lead AVR: R wave in AVR &gt;3 mm; R to S ratio in AVR &gt;0.7</p><p/><p>These signs are used as important tools in diagnosis, risk stratification, and management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87662%7EEM%2F87829%7EEM%2F87830%7EEM%2F87832\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef87662 graphicRef87829 graphicRef87830 graphicRef87832 \">waveform 2A-D</a>). However, none is completely reliable in the individual patient, and significant toxicity can occur despite falsely reassuring indices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Preexisting conduction delay may also complicate interpretation. We view prolongation of the QRS duration &gt;100 msec as a sign of potential cardiac toxicity, and as an indication for a trial of therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Sodium bicarbonate for cardiac toxicity'</a> below.)</p><p>Other possible ECG findings with TCA poisoning include prolongation of the PR and QT intervals, block within the His-Purkinje system, and intraventricular conduction delay (eg, bundle branch block). Because of its relatively longer refractory period, the right bundle branch is especially sensitive to block from TCA overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Several reports have described a Brugada type pattern following TCA overdose, with the incidence ranging from 2.3 to 15 percent following overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These conduction system abnormalities may contribute to the hypotension seen in TCA poisoning. Although QT prolongation is common in TCA overdose, the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes (TdP), is not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">QRS duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most prominent electrocardiographic manifestation of TCA toxicity is widening of the QRS interval. In one prospective series, patients with a QRS duration less than 100 msec did not suffer a seizure or a ventricular arrhythmia; those with a QRS duration &gt;100 msec had a 26 percent chance of seizure; and those with a QRS duration &gt;160 msec had a 50 percent chance of a ventricular arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although some authors have questioned the utility and reproducibility of QRS duration analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/20,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25,26</a>], other studies confirm the predictive value of QRS duration for seizure and ventricular arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In the setting of a TCA overdose, we consider a QRS interval duration greater than 100 msec an indication for bicarbonate therapy.

Precise measurement of this parameter can be performed but is complex and rarely done at the bedside. In qualitative terms, this conduction delay manifests as a deep, slurred S wave in leads I and AVL, and an R wave in lead AVR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63490\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63490 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F87662\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef87662 \">waveform 2A</a>).

One cohort study noted that the risk of seizures and ventricular arrhythmias was increased in patients with RAVR &gt;3 mm, <span class=\"nowrap\">R/SAVR</span> &gt;0.7, and QRS duration &gt;100 msec [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of TCA concentrations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Qualitative (urine) and quantitative (serum) TCA testing have limited therapeutic and prognostic utility in the acute setting. Significant illness can occur at drug concentrations not classically described as toxic, especially in children and in patients taking TCAs on a chronic basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/27,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31,32</a>]. In addition, a positive qualitative test only indicates use, not overdose, and multiple drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> cross-react with qualitative immunoassays, potentially yielding false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Quantitative serum concentrations are not only poor predictors of systemic toxicity, due to the kinetic changes described above, but are usually not available within a clinically relevant time frame [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p>For all these reasons, we do not advocate the use of any numerical level to gauge toxicity. The clinical picture dictates the need for therapy in TCA overdose; clinicians should not be falsely reassured by a low serum drug concentration, nor should they initiate therapy solely on the basis of a high serum drug concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H818565\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a definitive diagnosis of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose can be made using serum measurements, such testing is typically not available to clinicians in a timely fashion and seldom plays a role in patient management.

Sinus tachycardia and other arrhythmias, hypotension, cardiac conduction delays, and anticholinergic toxicity (hyperthermia, flushing, dilated pupils, intestinal ileus, urinary retention, and sinus tachycardia) are also common. Of note, patients with TCA poisoning can appear stable but deteriorate rapidly, and significant toxicity can occur despite falsely reassuring ECG findings.</p><p>ECG findings suggestive of cardiotoxicity include: prolongation of the QRS &gt;100 msec; abnormal morphology of the QRS (eg, deep, slurred S wave in leads I and AVL); and, abnormal size and ratio of the R and S waves in lead AVR (R wave in AVR &gt;3 mm; R to S ratio in AVR &gt;0.7), or possibly a Brugada pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H791506\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of patients presenting with toxicity from tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) is broad given the range of clinical findings (decreased level of consciousness, seizures, anticholinergic effects, hypotension, and widening of the QRS interval) associated with this poisoning.

(See <a href=\"#H790977\" class=\"local\">'Unhelpful and contraindicated therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Frequent reassessment of patients with known or suspected TCA intoxication is essential, as their level of alertness can change quickly. Patients may manifest psychomotor agitation and delirium in the initial hours after ingestion, only to develop progressive obtundation and coma in later stages. Thus, close monitoring, including pulse oximetry and a cardiac monitor, is necessary. In patients requiring treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, an arterial line makes it easier to perform frequent pH testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Sodium bicarbonate for cardiac toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> is the standard initial therapy for hypotension or arrhythmia due to TCA toxicity. Sodium bicarbonate therapy is indicated in patients with TCA poisoning who develop widening of the QRS interval &gt;100 msec or a ventricular arrhythmia.</p><p>The initial dose of hypertonic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg,</span> given as a rapid IV push through a large bore IV catheter. In adults, one common approach is to give two to three vials or prefilled syringes (50 mL each) of 8.4 percent sodium bicarbonate. If there is no response to the initial dose, it may be repeated after five minutes. It is useful to run a continuous 12-lead ECG during the infusion to demonstrate the presence (or absence) of narrowing of the QRS complex, a decrease in the R wave amplitude in lead AVR, or resolution of any arrhythmia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63490\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63490 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76352\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76352 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>If the QRS narrows after bolus therapy, begin a continuous IV infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. We mix 150 mEq of sodium bicarbonate in 1 L of 5 percent dextrose (D5W), and infuse at 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> in adults. The same fluid should be given to children at twice their maintenance fluid rate. Excessive fluid resuscitation, which can contribute to the pulmonary complications sometimes associated with TCA overdose, must be avoided.</p><p>Should a widened QRS interval fail to narrow following bolus therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, we still suggest that an IV infusion of sodium bicarbonate be started, absent an alternative diagnosis. Failure of a widened QRS to respond to bolus therapy does not exclude the possibility of TCA toxicity, and systemic acidemia potentiates the effects of TCA poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Frequent arterial blood pH measurements should be obtained during treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>; a reasonable goal pH is 7.50 to 7.55. Volume overload, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and metabolic alkalosis may result from prolonged bicarbonate infusions, and clinical and laboratory parameters must be followed closely to avoid these complications. We measure the arterial pH hourly until it is the therapeutic range and stable. Thereafter, measurements may be obtained every four to six hours. The serum potassium concentration should be measured concurrently with the arterial pH.</p><p>Most toxicologists taper bicarbonate therapy after the resolution of ECG changes, which may occur over hours to days. One reasonable approach is to reduce the infusion rate by about 25 percent per hour over four hours. Should the QRS interval widen during tapering, give an additional bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> and restart the original infusion rate. </p><p>The benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> is probably due to both an increase in serum pH and the increase in extracellular sodium. The increase in serum pH favors the neutral (ie, non-ionized) form of the drug, making it less available to bind to sodium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Increasing the extracellular sodium concentration increases the electrochemical gradient across cardiac cell membranes, potentially attenuating the TCA-induced blockade of rapid sodium channels.

The rationale for this therapy is based in part upon studies using animal models of TCA poisoning showing that hypertonic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> narrows the QRS complex, improves systolic blood pressure, and controls ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning/abstract/40,42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42-46</a>].

There are no clear, established criteria for determining when sodium bicarbonate therapy has failed and adjunct therapy should be given. One reasonable approach is to begin giving adjunct therapies to any patient who remains hypotensive with a wide QRS interval despite two treatments with sodium bicarbonate as described above.
