Thus, a combined modality approach is generally indicated when permitted by the patient's overall condition.</p><p>Decisions about the optimal integration of surgery, RT, and chemotherapy for each patient should be made with multidisciplinary input. The management plan should take into account the likely functional consequences of treatment as well as the expertise of the treatment team.</p><p>There are inadequate data from randomized clinical trials to define an optimal strategy for patients with stage III and IV oral cavity cancers. Recommendations and treatment planning are based upon trials that included large numbers of patients with primary tumors at other head and neck sites, observational data from series of patients with oral cavity cancer, and an analysis of individual patient circumstances. </p><p>Surgery is generally recommended as the initial therapy for locally advanced oral cavity cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In most cases, simultaneous resection and reconstruction is feasible with acceptable functional outcomes. RT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemoradiotherapy are alternatives for patients who refuse surgery, have a technically unresectable tumor (eg, due to carotid artery encasement, vertebral or brain invasion), would have an unacceptable functional outcome with surgery, or are medically inoperable. </p><p>Although there is a rationale for induction chemotherapy for locally advanced oral cavity cancer, the best available data show no survival advantage.

Small, clinically indeterminate pulmonary nodules are often identified and should be followed.</p><p>All patients should be seen preoperatively by the surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist for preoperative treatment planning. Assessment of comorbidity, speech and swallowing function, nutritional status, and dental and psychosocial evaluations are also important steps in treatment planning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of primary tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is generally preferred as the initial step in the treatment of locoregionally advanced oral cavity cancer, although data comparing surgery with RT are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6292878\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral cavity cancers can be accessed through a transoral approach or a combined transoral and transcervical approach. Traditional surgical techniques are generally used for locally advanced cancers. For these tumors, there is no advantage to minimally invasive approaches, such as transoral laser resection or robotic-assisted surgery, particularly given the complexity of the reconstruction that is often required.</p><p>Every attempt should be made to ensure negative resection margins, since there is an increased risk of treatment failure in patients with positive surgical margins, even when postoperative RT or chemoradiotherapy is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If positive margins are identified, reresection is indicated when feasible. Postoperative RT or chemoradiotherapy is indicated when positive surgical margins are identified. </p><p>Surgical procedures (eg, glossectomy, maxillectomy, mandibulectomy) can result in severe functional defects in speech and swallowing. The functional loss associated with these procedures may be mitigated by reconstruction and intense speech and swallowing rehabilitation.

Randomized trials that included patients with oral cavity cancers have confirmed the benefit of postoperative concurrent chemoradiation compared with postoperative RT alone for high-risk patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.

Positive margins and ENE are indications for chemoradiotherapy, and advanced nodal disease or perineural or vascular invasion may be a consideration for adding chemotherapy to RT. The presence of T3 or T4 disease, without any other high-risk features, is an indication for RT alone.

In that trial, 900 patients with predominantly gingival or buccal carcinoma were randomly assigned following surgery to RT alone (60 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks), accelerated RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions over five weeks), or RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks) in conjunction with chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly). For the entire study population, there was no difference in locoregional tumor control, disease-free survival, or overall survival. However, in an unplanned post hoc analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in all three outcome parameters, particularly overall survival, for high-risk patients (T3-T4, <span class=\"nowrap\">N2/N3,</span> ENE) and for patients treated with either concurrent chemotherapy or standard fractionation versus the accelerated RT course. Treatment compliance was equivalent in all groups. In a preliminary analysis, toxicity rates were equivalent in all three groups, although they trended towards more mucositis and dermatitis with six-days-per-week radiation.</p><p>Postoperative RT is generally preferred over preoperative RT for patients with locoregionally advanced oral cavity cancer.

A randomized trial of surgery with postoperative RT compared with definitive chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancer found that while survival rates were similar overall between the groups, a subset analysis for oral cavity cancers specifically demonstrated a survival advantage with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Initial RT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy is an alternative for patients who refuse surgery, have a technically unresectable tumor (carotid artery encasement, vertebral or brain invasion), would have an unacceptable functional outcome with surgery, or are medically inoperable. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combined modality approach utilizing both chemotherapy and RT is appropriate for patients who are not surgical candidates but whose overall condition will tolerate the potential increase in toxicity.

Because they are readily visible, most lip cancers are diagnosed at early stages, with T3 and T4 tumors representing a very small proportion of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

The combination of surgery and postoperative RT has been associated with better local control than either modality alone, as surgical resection alone (with 1 to 2 cm margins) for stage III and IV disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110767\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110767 \">table 1</a>) results in five-year overall survival of only 46 and 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>Cancer of the floor of mouth has a high rate of mandibular invasion and cervical lymph node metastases. Furthermore, anterior floor of mouth cancers often involve the geniohyoid tubercle and genioglossus muscle anteriorly. Thus, surgery will frequently require segmental mandibulectomy as a marginal resection of bone is generally not possible in the coronal plane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral tongue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oral tongue is the most common subsite for oral cavity cancer. Cancer of the oral tongue has been associated with a worse prognosis compared with other oral cavity subsites in some but not all series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Typically, five-year disease-specific survival rates of 39 and 27 percent have been achieved for stage III and IV disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Partial glossectomy is commonly required for locoregionally advanced disease. Total glossectomy is occasionally required in cases where bilateral lingual arteries are involved by cancer. In those cases, total laryngectomy may also be required to prevent aspiration. The addition of postoperative RT or chemoradiotherapy, appears to improve disease control compared with surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Primary treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy or sequential therapy may be preferred when total glossectomy is indicated, given the overall poor prognosis and functional loss associated with surgery. Patients considering this option should be aware of the potential trade-off between oncologic and functional outcome.

Patients with good dentition are often candidates for marginal resection of the mandible, which can be performed transorally. In contrast, edentulous patients and those with loose teeth involved by cancer require segmental resection of the mandible to ensure adequate clearance of disease. </p><p>Similarly, locally advanced retromolar trigone lesions typically require segmental mandibulectomy followed by postoperative RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Resection of the ascending ramus of the mandible including the pterygoid muscles is important to ensure eradication of disease. Microvascular reconstruction with a fibular free tissue transfer provides optimal functional and cosmetic rehabilitation.

Locally advanced lesions typically involve the underlying bone, and primary surgery is used more commonly than definitive RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Consequently, patients with buccal mucosa cancers have a worse survival rate compared with patients with cancer in other oral cavity subsites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Exposure of a buccal mucosa cancer can be difficult via a transoral approach, which makes it difficult to obtain clear radial margins in an en bloc fashion. Furthermore, the thin distance between the buccal mucosa and the buccal space permits early invasion to deep structures or to anterior cheek skin. Exenteration of the buccal space, parotid, and skin may be needed to maximize oncologic outcome for deeply invasive tumors, although this is achieved with a considerable cost to cosmesis. </p><p>Cancer of the buccal mucosa can be treated with definitive RT. However, deeply invasive cancers should be managed with surgery and postoperative RT. Regardless of the method of treatment, there is a high risk of severe, irreversible trismus. Aggressive reconstruction and rehabilitation is required to optimize functional outcomes.

The tracheostomy can usually be removed within a couple of weeks of surgery and prior to adjuvant therapy. In some cases, tracheostomy is maintained during adjuvant RT or chemoradiotherapy.</p><p>A feeding tube is usually required after surgery. A nasogastric feeding tube is feasible if the impact on swallowing is expected to be minimal and of relatively short duration. A gastrostomy tube is advised for patients in whom swallowing will be severely compromised. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF THE NECK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with stage III and IV oral cavity cancer either have clinically involved lymph node(s) in the neck or are at significant risk of subclinical nodal involvement due to the size and extent of the primary tumor. Thus, treatment of the neck is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; this usually includes unilateral or bilateral neck dissection with postoperative radiation therapy (RT).</p><p>The extent of neck dissection remains controversial. Limiting the extent of dissection reduces surgical morbidity, particularly if level V is excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 2</a>). A selective dissection including levels I to III, a supraomohyoid neck dissection, is typically sufficient for clinically N0 oral cavity cancer, as level IV and V nodes are rarely involved without clinical disease at other levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. This dissection includes the submandibular gland but preserves the spinal accessory nerve, the internal jugular vein, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Some cancers of the oral tongue, however, involve level IV lymph nodes without disease being present in levels I to III, a phenomenon known as &quot;skip metastases&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>While patients with clinically involved regional lymph nodes may benefit from a complete modified neck dissection, selective neck dissection has been demonstrated to be oncologically sound in patients with advanced oral cavity cancer.</p><p>Contralateral metastases, and hence the need for bilateral neck treatment, are more likely for tumors that approach or cross the midline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, ventral oral tongue and floor of mouth cancers are at very high risk for bilateral nodal involvement. If postoperative RT is planned for the ipsilateral neck, some groups advocate RT to the contralateral N0 neck rather than neck dissection. Bilateral neck dissection combined with bilateral neck RT has a high risk of significant lymphedema, although surgical sparing of the jugular vein is the most important aspect of preventing edema in patients undergoing a bilateral neck dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>For patients receiving definitive RT, irradiation of the neck should follow the same indications as for neck dissection.</p><p>For patients initially treated with RT or chemoradiotherapy, management of the neck can be complex. A general discussion of the management of the neck in this situation is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-neck-following-definitive-radiotherapy-with-or-without-chemoradiotherapy-in-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the neck following definitive radiotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both surgery and RT can have a profound effect on the quality of life, given the role of the oral cavity in speech, mastication, and swallowing. Thus, careful patient selection and surgical planning is required for all locoregionally advanced oral cavity cancer patients. The use of a multimodality approach in locally advanced oral cavity cancers increases the risk of serious complications.</p><p>Potential direct surgical complications include infection, bleeding, aspiration, wound breakdown, flap loss, and fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Irradiation of the oral cavity and neck may result in mucositis, skin reaction, xerostomia, loss of taste, and dysphagia. Late toxicities may include skin and soft tissue atrophy and fibrosis, osteoradionecrosis, xerostomia, and trismus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Recovery from xerostomia after irradiation of the oral cavity, even with modern conformal techniques, is more limited than with other head and neck sites because of higher doses of irradiation to the submandibular glands and larger volumes of oral mucosa and the minor salivary glands in the treatment fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Xerostomia also exacerbates other late complications, such as difficulty swallowing, impaired speech, and dental caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible is a particularly feared consequence of high-dose radiation to the oral cavity, and one of the primary reasons that surgery is often preferred to definitive RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The adoption of newer reconstructive techniques may decrease functional deficits from radical surgery involving the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oral-cavity/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, these reconstructive techniques do not restore motor or sensory function. This is acceptable for smaller defects (eg, hemiglossectomy reconstructed with radial forearm free flap) where the remaining normal tissue can compensate well. On the other hand, larger defects (eg, total glossectomy reconstructed with rectus free flap) may result in permanent debilitating functional loss.
