Management of nutritional needs in burn patients has many features in common with the nutritional management of other critically ill surgical patients. However, the severity, magnitude, and duration of the hypermetabolic response and the ensuing energy requirements for the severe burn patient are far greater than other critically ill patients.</p><p>The unique characteristics of nutritional requirements in the moderate and severe burn patient, including patient selection, initiation, and delivery of nutritional support will be discussed here. Other aspects of nutritional support in burn patients are reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional demands and enteral formulas for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating nutritional support for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional support is the provision of nutrients and any necessary adjunctive therapeutic agents to improve or maintain the nutritional status. Nutritional support is administered into the stomach or small intestine (enteral) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by intravenous infusion (parenteral) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY GOAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of nutritional support following severe burn injury is to meet the distinctive demands placed upon the body by hypermetabolism. The adverse effects of the hypermetabolic response can result in life-threatening protein-calorie malnutrition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The specific areas of concern that must be addressed in burn patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of lean body mass</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitation of fat accretion and protein wasting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assisting and enhancing wound healing</p><p/><p>Enteral nutrition, which is administered through a nasogastric, gastric, or intestinal tube, is the preferred method of feeding critically ill patients and an important means of counteracting hypermetabolism. Supplementary parenteral nutrition should be given only to those patients who do not reach their target nutrient intake on enteral feedings alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although provision of adequate nutrition is vital in all burn injuries, identification of patients who require coordinated nutritional support is a key component of the comprehensive care of the patient with moderate-to-severe burns. However, there is limited evidence to support the decision-making process and the timing of the initiation of nutritional support in the critical care setting. Consultation with a dietitian experienced in the nutritional care of burn patients can prove exceptionally helpful in all aspects of the nutritional care of these patients.</p><p>Identification of patients who are likely to require coordinated nutritional support presents a substantial challenge because of the heterogeneity of the metabolic response and the burn injury patterns. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), a multidisciplinary expert group, formulated nutritional guidelines based on six randomized controlled trials that met their study criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In their consensus statement, ESPEN recommends enteral nutrition be provided to all critically ill patients, including severe burn patients, who will not initiate oral nutrition within three days of injury or illness. </p><p>Patients with moderate-to-severe burn injuries as well as those with the following conditions should receive enteral nutritional support to meet energy requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to tolerate oral feedings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to sustain themselves on oral intake alone</p><p/><p>Nutritional support is used selectively in patients with minor (&lt;20 percent) burn injury.

The metabolic rate increases proportionally with burn size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A 15 to 25 percent total body surface area (TBSA) burn injury initiates a catabolic response, including impaired immunity and fluid shifts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Patients who have sustained an inhalation injury or who have extensive facial burns, both of which are likely to result in a prolonged ventilator course, usually meet this criterion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure to thrive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure to maintain lean body mass (LBM) and body weight (ie, dry body weight or weight on postburn day five) with oral intake is an indication for nutritional support. Patients with moderate burns that involve 20 to 40 percent of TBSA may not be able to consume sufficient calories to maintain LBM and weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, patients who require extensive surgery, develop complications of their injury, or have a known nutritional deficiency at the time of admission may not consume adequate calories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Nutritional support following burn injury is unlikely to redress preexisting conditions but is intended to treat the metabolic demands incurred as a result of the burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children are quite vulnerable to the metabolic demands and consequences of a burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. They have greater basal metabolic requirements than adults per unit of weight because of energy needed to sustain growth and activity. Children also mount a hypermetabolic response to burns comparable to the response seen in adults, but have relatively limited energy reserves when compared to adults.</p><p>Oral intake in burned children may prove particularly challenging because of pain and anxiety, as well as the inability of younger children to comprehend the importance of adequate oral intake. The psychological aspects of nutrition coupled with the deleterious effects of acute protein-calorie malnutrition mean that enteral nutritional support should be started in children earlier and with less severe injuries than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older adult patients with burn injuries may provide a particular challenge in nutritional management for a variety of reasons. Because of immunosenescence, older adults do not heal wounds as readily as their younger counterparts. Older adult patients have a higher incidence of malnutrition at the time of injury, which may result in poorer outcomes unless nutritional status is effectively addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Under normal circumstances, older adults have a decreased resting metabolic rate and may be unable to generate an increase in metabolism to meet the demands of a burn injury. Finally, because of underlying organ dysfunction consequent to aging or true medical comorbidities, limitation of some macronutrients (eg, protein, fat) and micronutrients (eg, potassium, glucose) may be appropriate in the older adult burned patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic syndrome includes six components of illness in which patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These six components include abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance with or without glucose intolerance, proinflammatory state, and prothrombotic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Glycemic control can prove even more difficult in these patients who are already predisposed to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Obesity often lends a false sense of security that patients are well nourished when, in fact, the converse is true. Obese patients typically have decreased visceral protein stores and muscle mass, and the hormonal response of hypermetabolism limits the body's ability to use fat stores as an energy source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The metabolic syndrome and its associated manifestations obscure an already complicated process of determining which burn patients require nutritional support.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATION OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providing nutrition is accepted as essential in the successful management of the burn patient; however, the optimal timing of initiating nutritional support is debated. The safety and efficacy of initiating enteral feedings has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], as well as a trend towards decreased infection rates and decreased calorie deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Guidelines from the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) support enteral nutrition initiation within 48 hours of hospital admission for all critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of three randomized, controlled trials involving 70 adult burn patients that evaluated early (within 24 hours) versus late (after 24 hours) enteral nutritional support found no significant benefit of early enteral feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Clinical outcomes of length of hospital stay, infection, or mortality were similar in both groups, but it remains unclear whether early enteral nutritional support has any beneficial impact on a diverse field of nutritional, metabolic, and biochemical outcome markers. The trials showed some promising results that would suggest early enteral nutrition support may attenuate the hypermetabolic response, but are insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice. This meta-analysis was limited by methodological weakness, including the small number of patients, lack of description of burn depth, and only one study reporting on each of the following outcomes: mortality, length of hospital stay, rate of infections, and number of adverse events. Some studies indicate that nutritional support should be started within 24 hours after the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical practice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the hemodynamically stable patient with a 20 to 80 percent burn, we suggest initiating nutritional support in the form of enteral feeding within 24 to 48 hours after burn. In unstable patients, nutritional support should be started as soon as patients can tolerate enteral feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/2,8,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,23</a>].

The enteral route is preferred in burn patients who require nutritional support because of the maintenance of intestinal integrity and associated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Enteral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral nutritional support can be delivered through the stomach or the small intestine. </p><p>Prompt initiation of gastric feedings following injury decreases gastroparesis. Advantages of gastric nutritional support include the ease of tube placement, the decreased incidence of diarrhea, and the beneficial impact on stress ulcer prophylaxis. The key disadvantage of gastric nutritional support is that many moderate-to-severe burn patients require multiple operative procedures, frequently requiring suspension of gastric feedings perioperatively to decrease the risk of aspiration. </p><p>If nutritional support cannot be established via the stomach within the first 24 to 48 hours following a burn injury, intestinal feeding may be better tolerated since the small bowel is less affected by post-burn ileus than the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. While placement of an intestinal tube is technically more difficult than placement of a gastric tube and there is a greater risk of dislodgment with the intestinal tube, the low risk of aspiration with intestinal feedings and the ability to continue using them during patient repositioning, wound care, and even through operative procedures provides a slight advantage over gastric feeding in severe burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Some centers use fluoroscopy or electromagnetic placement devices to place the tube past the ligament of Treitz. Other centers have specific protocols using GI kinetics as a two-step procedure to place enteric feeding tubes. Enteral feedings are initiated at a low rate and increased to an established goal rate over the next 12 to 18 hours. </p><p>In most burn centers, intestinal feeding is preferred and may be required if a patient has a particularly high risk for aspiration or has demonstrated intolerance for gastric nutritional support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. The practice at our burn center is to place a nasoenteral feeding tube at the bedside in all patients with moderate-to-severe burn injury within 48 hours of admission. We only provide gastric feedings when the tube cannot be advanced past the pylorus; however, many burn centers safely and successfully use only gastric feedings or use a combination of gastric and enteric feedings. The effectiveness of gastric versus intestinal nutritional support remains an area of controversy in burn care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-feeding-gastric-versus-post-pyloric\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral feeding: Gastric versus post-pyloric&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenteral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral nutrition is indicated if the adult or pediatric burn patient cannot tolerate enteral feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27</a>]. Burn patients with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain or ileus or those who have had previous gastrointestinal problems and cannot receive sufficient calories via the enteral route are candidates for parenteral nutritional support. The cutoff for the initiation of parenteral nutrition is persistent feeding intolerance for more than 48 to 72 hours. Persistent feeding intolerance is identified by abdominal distention, high gastric residuals, or intractable diarrhea following initiation of enteral nutrition.</p><p>Parenteral nutritional support should be provided via central venous access. Peripheral nutritional support will not provide adequate calories to meet the metabolic demands from a severe burn injury.</p><p>In a retrospective review of 67 burn patients, septic and metabolic complications were significantly reduced in patients who received enteral nutrition (n = 33) versus a similar cohort who received parenteral nutrition (n = 34) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There was no statistical difference in age, gender or TBSA burn, or length of hospital stay between the two groups. Those who received enteral nutritional support had significantly higher serum prealbumin and transferrin levels, and fewer hypoglycemic events, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary complications, sepsis and mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplementation of enteral nutrition with parenteral nutrition in burn patients has been associated with a significant increase in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. A randomized trial of 39 patients with greater than 50 percent TBSA burn found that aggressive high-calorie feeding with a combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition was associated with significantly higher mortality than enteral feedings alone (63 and 26 percent, respectively). Intravenous supplementation decreased the amount of enteral calories tolerated by burn patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Therefore, parenteral nutrition is appropriate only in those burn patients who have prolonged intolerance to enteral feeds and who are absolutely unable to attain adequate protein and calorie intake on enteral nutrition or those who suffer with burns that limit access to the stomach or small intestines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients/abstract/9,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,31</a>].
