This half of the native molecule is 50 percent similar to erythropoietin, contains the receptor-binding domain, but very little biologic activity in vivo due to the absence of the remaining, carbohydrate-rich portion of the native molecule which gives it a very short circulatory half-life. Addition of the polyethylene glycol moiety serves to replace the missing carbohydrate domain and stabilize the molecule in the circulation. PEG-rHuMGDF has a half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Clinical development of this molecule was stopped because of the development of antibodies, leading to thrombocytopenia, in approximately 8 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/2,3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,10</a>].

Dimerization of this peptide increased its activity 10,000-fold, thereby making it as active as recombinant TPO.</p><p>A key attribute of all of the peptide TPO receptor agonists is the need for a structure that allows them to dimerize and activate the TPO receptor. These peptides have too short a half-life in the circulation to be clinically active.

One potential advantage they have over the peptide TPO receptor agonists is that they may be administered orally. Many of these molecules bind to and activate the TPO receptor by a mechanism different from endogenous TPO, recombinant TPO, or the peptide TPO receptor agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However, several other thrombopoietic growth factors not related to thrombopoietin or its receptor have been developed.

However, when the recombinant thrombopoietins or peptide TPO receptor agonists (but not the non-peptide TPO receptor agonists) are added directly to platelets (or persist at elevated levels in the circulation in vivo), they decrease by approximately 50 percent the threshold for activation by various platelet agonists (eg, ADP, collagen) in platelet aggregometry studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>]. This is probably not clinically relevant, since studies with recombinant thrombopoietins in oncology patients, a patient group with an inherent increased rate of thrombosis, showed no increased rate of thrombosis. Furthermore, treatment of baboons with PEG-rHuMGDF did not increase fibrin deposition in extravascular shunts despite marked increases in platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>].

An unfortunate aspect of product labeling for TPO receptor agonists in ITP is the suggestion that they be held if the platelet count rises over 400,000; this is based on no identified risk but was part of the dosing algorithm of the initial clinical trials. Unfortunately, given the greatly shorted platelet life-span, stopping the drug results in a rapid decrease in platelet count; platelet counts may often drop from &gt;400,000 to less than 5000 in less than one week. Rebound thrombocytopenia (defined as the platelet count dropping 10,000 below the prior baseline) was seen in approximately 10 percent of clinical trial patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4016840\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of thrombopoietin (TPO) molecules have been developed; they define a new and growing family of molecules called the thrombopoietin (c-mpl ligand) family, based upon their common ability to bind and activate the TPO receptor, c-mpl (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55953 \">table 1</a>).
