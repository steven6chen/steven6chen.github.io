Of these, approximately 20 percent can be attributed to coronary artery disease (CAD), also referred to as coronary heart disease (CHD).

The specific evaluation depends on patient comorbidities. Among transplant candidates, the cardiac evaluation is often initiated by the transplant center. The evaluation of such patients is discussed elsewhere.

In addition, the ECG may reveal undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, which is common among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

We do not obtain screening echocardiogram at the very start of dialysis, because patients are often mildly to moderately volume overloaded. Volume-dependent changes that are observed on echocardiograms that are obtained at the beginning of dialysis (such as elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, increased estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction) may become normal once dry weight has been attained through more rigorous fluid management on dialysis.</p><p>Patients who have a persistent reduction in ejection fraction of &lt;40 percent at one to three months after dialysis initiation and do not have a previously established diagnosis of CHD generally require further evaluation for CHD including noninvasive stress imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coronary angiography if patients are considered candidates for revascularization. CHD is a common cause of reduced ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This approach is consistent with recommendations from the American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACCF/AHA)</span> guideline for the management of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The approach to the evaluation of such patients may vary among cardiologists. For many patients, particularly patients who are considered less likely to have CHD (such as younger patients without diabetes), the authors of this topic review perform stress testing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography first. Patients who have abnormal stress imaging are evaluated with angiography. By avoiding angiography in selected patients, this approach may help to preserve residual renal function in patients who are just starting dialysis. Better residual renal function has been associated with increased survival among dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine output and residual kidney function in kidney failure&quot;, section on 'Clinical importance of residual kidney function'</a>.)</p><p>However, based on practice guidelines in the general population, some cardiologists recommend proceeding directly to coronary angiography without stress testing, particularly those ESRD patients at medium or high risk for CHD (eg, diabetic ESRD).</p><p>Patients with reduced ejection fraction also require additional medical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapy of heart failure in hemodialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627520949\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation of symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All dialysis patients who develop symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of CHD should be evaluated for CHD and for clinically unsuspected valvular disease (such as aortic stenosis).</p><p>As noted above, signs and symptoms of CHD include classic angina symptoms that develop during exertion or dialysis, recurrent hypotension (on or off dialysis), heart failure that is unresponsive to changes in dry weight, and intradialytic hypotension that prevents attaining dry weight. Patients who have known CHD and chronic stable symptoms should be evaluated for CHD if any symptoms change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The evaluation depends on the clinical stability of the patient. Patients who are not stable (ie, have persistent symptoms off dialysis and at rest and have persistent hemodynamic instability off dialysis) should be evaluated for acute coronary syndrome (ie, unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction [AMI]). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Acute coronary syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal strategy for evaluating and treating ESRD patients with stable symptomatic CHD is not known. All such patients should undergo a history and physical examination and an ECG. Patients who have an ECG that is normal or unchanged from baseline and are clinically stable undergo noninvasive testing with stress imaging. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Depending upon the severity of ischemia, dialysis patients who have positive stress tests and are candidates for coronary revascularization should have coronary angiography. Coronary angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of coronary CHD in patients with or without advanced kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Coronary angiography'</a> below.)</p><p>However, patients who have only mild ischemia suggested by noninvasive testing (in centers that have confidence in the accuracy for detection of CHD) and who have stable angina during exertion or during dialysis may be treated medically without angiography.</p><p>Patients with moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing may undergo angiography, provided that they are candidates for revascularization. However, the benefit of revascularization versus medical therapy in such patients is not clear.

This is because commonly used methods in the general population involve exercise testing, which is often not able to be used accurately in ESRD patients, due to limitations in exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, baseline abnormalities on the ECG and thallium scintigraphy induced by the abnormal metabolic milieu in advanced kidney disease may decrease the accuracy of different tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The accuracy of the different noninvasive imaging tests tends to be center specific and dependent upon the expertise of the examiner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. As a result, there is significant institutional variation in the approach to noninvasive evaluation of CHD in dialysis patients.</p><p>Commonly used noninvasive tests in the general population include exercise ECG, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography, adenosine- or dipyridamole-induced echocardiography, and stress by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a> plus nuclear scintigraphy.

Among dialysis patients, dobutamine-induced stress echocardiography appears to be more sensitive than other noninvasive tests, including vasodilator-induced stress nuclear scintigraphy. This is largely derived from studies in diabetic kidney transplant candidates (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal transplantation in diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 125 candidates, all patients underwent coronary angiography, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography, and resting and exercise ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Independent predictors of severe CHD (defined as luminal stenosis &gt;70 percent by visual estimation in at least one epicardial artery) were a positive stress echocardiography result (odds ratio [OR] 23, 95% CI 6-88) or an abnormal resting ECG (OR 7, 95% CI 2-34).

In a retrospective, cohort-matched study, dialysis patients were compared with nondialysis patients using data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) and National Registry of Myocardial Infarction databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Compared with nondialysis patients with an AMI, dialysis patients with an AMI were significantly less likely to present with chest pain (68 versus 44 percent, respectively) or have ST elevation (36 versus 19 percent, respectively). ESRD patients were also less likely to have an initial diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome on admission (55 versus 79 percent in non-ESRD patients).</p><p>The increased incidence of atypical presentations may result in under-diagnosis and under-treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Symptoms are commonly attributed to causes other than myocardial ischemia. As an example, the presence of dyspnea alone due to an AMI in an individual scheduled to undergo a regular chronic dialysis procedure may be mistakenly attributed to volume overload.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the patient suspected of having an acute coronary syndrome is generally the same as in patients without kidney disease. It is based upon the clinical presentation, ECG, and relevant laboratory tests, including a time-appropriate (with respect to the episode of suspected acute coronary syndrome) rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers. A detailed discussion of the diagnosis of AMI in patients without kidney disease is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among ESRD patients, ECG manifestations of acute coronary syndrome are similar to the general population (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'ECG Assessment'</a>). However, baseline abnormalities on the ECG, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and ST-T changes in the absence of ischemia, may mask characteristic changes of ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In addition, compared with the general population, ESRD patients with AMI are less likely to have ST elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/23,24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,26</a>]. In the study cited above, only 19 percent of ESRD patients with AMI presented with ST elevation compared with 36 percent in nondialysis patients with AMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The serologic diagnosis of AMI is more difficult in patients with ESRD because of elevations in cardiac biomarkers that are unrelated to acute coronary syndrome. This is discussed in detail separately.

Angina may be provoked by hemodialysis. Patients may also present with exertional angina or dyspnea, intradialytic or interdialytic hypotension, sudden cardiac arrest or death, and arrhythmias. Silent myocardial ischemia is common. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain baseline electrocardiography (ECG) at the initiation of maintenance dialysis and a transthoracic echocardiogram within one to three months of initiation of maintenance dialysis. Patients with a reduced ejection fraction of &lt;40 percent generally require further evaluation including noninvasive stress imaging and often coronary angiography. (See <a href=\"#H1627520925\" class=\"local\">'Screening at dialysis initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All dialysis patients who develop symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of coronary heart disease (CHD) should be evaluated for CHD and for clinically unsuspected valvular disease (such as aortic stenosis). Stable patients are evaluated with an ECG, noninvasive testing with stress imaging, and, depending upon the severity of ischemia and patient candidacy for revascularization, coronary angiography. (See <a href=\"#H1627520949\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among dialysis patients, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography rather than other noninvasive tests. Among dialysis patients, dobutamine-induced stress echocardiography appears to be more sensitive than other noninvasive tests. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal transplantation in diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive testing'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of coronary disease in patients with or without advanced kidney disease. We refer for angiography patients who are candidates for coronary revascularization and have either positive stress tests or acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina) or angina inadequately controlled by optimal medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Coronary angiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis patients with acute coronary syndrome generally present with the same symptoms as non-ESRD patients, including chest pain associated with dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. However, dialysis patients are more likely than nondialysis patients to have atypical symptoms, such as isolated dyspnea, weakness, syncope, palpitations, or cardiac arrest. Atypical presentations may result in under-diagnosis and under-treatment.
