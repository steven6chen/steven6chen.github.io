Primary infection with VZV results in varicella, also known as chickenpox, characterized by vesicular lesions in different stages of development concentrated on the face and trunk, and less so on the extremities. Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, results from reactivation of latent VZV (from the varicella infection) in neurons within the sensory ganglia. Herpes zoster is characterized by a painful, unilateral vesicular eruption that occurs in a restricted dermatomal distribution.</p><p>Vaccines are available for prevention of both infections. This topic will address the use of the two vaccines licensed to prevent herpes zoster. A discussion of the vaccine to prevent varicella (chickenpox) is found elsewhere.

A decline in cell-mediated immunity has been documented in older individuals and in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies, both populations that experience higher rates of herpes zoster (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79262 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. These epidemiologic observations are supported by in vitro data that demonstrate reduced VZV-specific T cell frequency in aging patients who are more susceptible to virus activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Approximately 30 to 40 percent of persons over the age of 55 years do not have any detectable VZV-specific T cell responses by some assay methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Among those who develop herpes zoster, in vitro data suggest that robust VZV cell-mediated immunity at the onset of rash is correlated with reduced severity of disease and less risk of postherpetic neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Immunocompromised patients who lack adequate VZV-specific cellular immune responses are at greater risk for prolonged episodes of reactivation and disseminated disease, which can be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

As an example, in allogeneic stem cell transplants, both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are ablated, and although antibody is replaced with intravenous gamma-globulin (which contains VZV antibody), these patients have very high rates of herpes zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, children with hypogammaglobulinemia do not experience severely protracted or fulminant primary varicella infection or increased rates of herpes zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4543182\"><span class=\"h2\">Boosting of T cell specific immunity to VZV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cell-mediated immune responses improve with periodic subclinical varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation (endogenous boosting), which may limit virus replication and decrease the risk of developing herpes zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. Environmental boosting of T cell responses has also been documented among VZV-immune healthy adults who have had household exposures to children with primary varicella, which may also decrease the risk of herpes zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/4,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-13</a>]. The impact of varicella vaccination on the incidence of herpes zoster is discussed elsewhere.

Vaccination is <strong>not</strong> indicated for the treatment of herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia. There are certain precautions and contraindications to vaccination, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3098821208\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1534613726\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications to RZV'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3190009331\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and precautions for ZVL'</a> below.)</p><p>It is <strong>not</strong> necessary to determine whether patients have a history of varicella or herpes zoster prior to vaccination because waning antibodies in previously exposed patients (particularly older adults) may lead to negative results despite past infection. In addition, a self-reported history of shingles is often of questionable reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. More than 96 percent of individuals who have resided 30 years in the United States have serologic evidence of prior varicella, and a majority of people claiming no prior varicella have varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Moreover, inadvertent administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoster-shingles-vaccine-live-attenuated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoster vaccine live</a> (ZVL) to VZV-na&iuml;ve individuals has been well tolerated in immune competent individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

ZVL contains 18,700 (at expiry) to 60,000 plaque-forming units of virus, considerably more than the approximately 1350 plaque-forming units found in the <span class=\"nowrap\">Oka/Merck</span> vaccine for prevention of varicella. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-chickenpox-primary-varicella-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccination for the prevention of chickenpox (primary varicella infection)&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>We suggest RZV rather than ZVL for most immunocompetent patients. Special considerations for immunocompromised hosts and other patient groups, as well as information on vaccine administration, are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1216700954\" class=\"local\">'Patients aged 50 to 59'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2764256136\" class=\"local\">'Comorbid conditions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2542471416\" class=\"local\">'Patients who received live attenuated herpes zoster or varicella vaccine'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1021045153\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine administration'</a> below.) </p><p>We generally prefer RZV based upon evidence that it has greater efficacy, especially among people in their seventh to ninth decade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116904 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1462228120\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of the different vaccines'</a> below). In addition, there is less concern for waning immunity with RZV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although long-term data are not available for RZV, protection has extended to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and immune responses are elevated for at least six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. With ZVL, protection appears unchanged through year 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], but wanes significantly after about eight years (from approximately 50 percent to 20 to 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-31</a>]. In one study, there was no benefit from ZVL in reducing herpes zoster after year 8, but prevention of postherpetic neuralgia was better preserved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>There are a few advantages of ZVL as compared with RZV. As an example, ZVL requires administration of one dose of the vaccine, versus two for RZV. In addition, ZVL has a lower incidence of side effects that prevent everyday activities. Systemic side effects such as myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, and fever typically occur in &lt;1 percent of those who receive ZVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], but developed in approximately 11 percent of those who received RZV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116904 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/23,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33</a>]. However, these side effects usually resolve in one to three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/23,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33,34</a>], and rarely prevent patients from completing the RZV vaccine series. A more detailed discussion of the side effects of RZV and ZVL is presented below. (See <a href=\"#H2393847301\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events associated with RZV'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events associated with ZVL'</a> below.)</p><p>The choice of RZV as the preferred type of vaccine is consistent with recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which were accepted by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, not all members of the ACIP agreed with this preferential recommendation (vote split eight to seven), citing concerns about the lack of data on its performance among minority groups, relatively limited data on long-term vaccine safety and efficacy, including limited data when administered in a nonclinical trial setting, and issues related to a two-dose schedule. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1462228120\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of the different vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the two vaccines have not been compared head-to-head, the efficacy of RZV observed in two randomized trials appears superior to that observed for ZVL.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy of ZVL</strong> &ndash; The efficacy of zoster vaccination for reducing the risk of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia was first demonstrated in the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), a placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the ZVL in 38,546 adults 60 years of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. More than 95 percent of the subjects completed three years of surveillance with the following results:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Confirmed herpes zoster occurred in 957 patients (2.5 percent). ZVL reduced the incidence of herpes zoster over approximately three years by 51 percent compared with placebo (1.6 versus 3.3 percent, respectively), but vaccine efficacy was significantly greater in individuals aged 60 to 69 years compared with those &ge;70 years (63.9 versus 37.6 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In those who developed herpes zoster, the median duration of pain and discomfort was modestly reduced in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group (21 versus 24 days, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The incidence of postherpetic neuralgia was reduced by 67 percent in the vaccine group (0.46 versus 1.38 cases per 1000 person-years). Unlike the incidence of herpes zoster, the benefit was greater in patients &ge;70 years of age (0.71 versus 2.13 per 1000 person-years). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postherpetic-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postherpetic neuralgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An immunology substudy of 1395 patients demonstrated increases in VZV-specific antibody and cell-mediated immunity at six weeks after vaccination compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These increases persisted during the three years of follow-up, although the magnitude of T cell responses declined over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed the benefits observed in the earlier definitive SPS study and calculated that 50 people need to be vaccinated to protect one person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A post-licensure observational study of ZVL effectiveness reinforced the potential of the vaccine to reduce significant morbidity in patients 60 years of age or older. This retrospective study evaluated immunocompetent patients (75,761 patients were vaccinated and 227,283 matched patients were unvaccinated) during a two-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A total of 5434 cases of herpes zoster were identified; in an adjusted analysis, vaccination was associated with a significantly reduced risk of herpes zoster (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI 0.42-0.48). This risk reduction occurred in all age strata (60 to &gt;80 years of age) and among individuals with chronic diseases (eg, diabetes, liver disease, coronary artery disease). The risk of ophthalmic herpes zoster and hospitalization was also reduced by approximately two-thirds among vaccine recipients. An even larger effectiveness trial confirmed these findings for herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The efficacy of vaccination among patients 50 to 59 years of age was evaluated in the Zostavax Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST). In this trial, 22,439 patients aged 50 to 59 years from the United States and Europe were randomly assigned to vaccine or placebo and followed for a mean of 15 months for the development of herpes zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The vaccine efficacy for preventing herpes zoster was 70 percent (95% CI 54.1-80.6); zoster vaccine reduced the incidence of herpes zoster from 99 cases in the placebo group (6.6 per 1000 person-years) to 30 cases in the vaccine group (2 per 1000 person-years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy of RZV</strong> &ndash; Two randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of RZV.

During a mean follow-up of approximately three years, RZV reduced the risk of developing herpes zoster by 97.2 percent (95% CI 93.7-99.0); herpes zoster was confirmed in six individuals in the RZV group and 210 individuals in the placebo group. In addition, no cases of postherpetic neuralgia were reported in the RZV group compared with 18 cases reported in the placebo group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RZV was subsequently evaluated in 13,900 adults 70 years or older who were followed for a mean of 3.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The efficacy of RZV in preventing herpes zoster was 90 percent (95% CI 84.2-93.7); herpes zoster developed in 23 patients who received the vaccine versus 223 who received placebo. In addition, the vaccine efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia was 89 percent (95% CI 68.7-97.1). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2702428598\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1216700954\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients aged 50 to 59</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although both vaccines are approved for patients &ge;50 years old, the ACIP does not recommend ZVL for patients aged 50 to 59 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], in part because of the limited long-term protection provided by ZVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-31</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decline in VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity, which occurs in immune compromised and older individuals, is regarded as the major precipitant for VZV reactivation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Importance of cell-mediated immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herpes zoster vaccination decreases the risk of developing herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. It is <strong>not</strong> necessary to determine whether patients have a history of prior varicella (chickenpox) or herpes zoster, or to check antibodies prior to vaccination. (See <a href=\"#H3292007704\" class=\"local\">'Indications for vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two types of vaccines, a non-live recombinant glycoprotein E vaccine (designated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-zoster-shingles-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant zoster vaccine</a> [RZV]; approved for use in the United States in October 2017) and a live attenuated vaccine (designated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoster-shingles-vaccine-live-attenuated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoster vaccine live</a> [ZVL]). (See <a href=\"#H1462228120\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of the different vaccines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H350379984\" class=\"local\">'Non-live recombinant glycoprotein E vaccine (RZV)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1045955695\" class=\"local\">'Zoster vaccine live (ZVL)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We consider vaccination in the following groups of patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For immunocompetent patients &ge;60 years of age, we recommend zoster vaccination to prevent herpes zoster (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We also suggest zoster vaccination for such individuals who are 50 years of age or older (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3292007704\" class=\"local\">'Indications for vaccination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1216700954\" class=\"local\">'Patients aged 50 to 59'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with prior herpes zoster infection, we suggest vaccination against herpes zoster (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We delay vaccination for approximately three years since herpes zoster itself will boost VZV-specific immunity. However, the efficacy and appropriate timing of vaccination has not been studied in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H3677595933\" class=\"local\">'Patients with prior herpes zoster infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients &ge;50 years old who are planning immunosuppressive therapy (eg, transplant patients, chronic autoimmune disease), we recommend zoster vaccination as long as vaccination can be completed within a certain period of time prior to immunosuppression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The timing of vaccination depends upon which type of vaccine is used. (See <a href=\"#H3098821208\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If vaccination prior to immunosuppression is not possible, we suggest vaccination for patients receiving low-level immunosuppression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, for most other immunocompromised patients (eg, those who have a primary immunodeficiency or are receiving moderate- to high-dose immunosuppressive therapy), there are insufficient data to recommend routine vaccination with RZV, and ZVL is contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H3098821208\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest RZV rather than ZVL for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). RZV appears to provide greater protection against herpes zoster. In addition, there is less concern for waning immunity. Disadvantages of RZV are the need for two doses (versus one with ZVL), and an increased risk of mild to moderate side effects (including those that prevent everyday activities). However, the side effects typically resolve in one to three days, and these factors rarely prevent patients from completing the RZV series. (See <a href=\"#H983812502\" class=\"local\">'Choice of vaccine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1021045153\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The only contraindication to RZV is hypersensitivity to the vaccine components. However, the safety of RZV in patients with comorbid conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases, as well as transplant recipients, is still to be determined. Until more data are available, the benefits of using RZV in such patients must be weighed against the theoretical risks (eg, a flare of the underlying condition, rejection of the graft) due to the immune response elicited by the adjuvant. (See <a href=\"#H1534613726\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications to RZV'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4182602447\" class=\"local\">'Other conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ZVL is<strong> contraindicated</strong> in most immunocompromised patients, as well as in patients with anaphylactic reactions to gelatin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a> and pregnant women. (See <a href=\"#H3190009331\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and precautions for ZVL'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3098821208\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who previously received ZVL, we suggest revaccination with RZV (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Such patients should receive the two-dose series, which should be initiated at least eight weeks after ZVL. (See <a href=\"#H2542471416\" class=\"local\">'Patients who received live attenuated herpes zoster or varicella vaccine'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Weinberg A, Levin MJ.
