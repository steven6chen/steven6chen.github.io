The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of pediculosis capitis will be reviewed here. Other forms of louse infestation, including pediculosis corporis and pediculosis pubis, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediculosis-corporis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediculosis corporis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediculosis-pubis-and-pediculosis-ciliaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediculosis pubis and pediculosis ciliaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediculosis capitis occurs worldwide and in individuals of all socioeconomic backgrounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Children are affected most frequently.</p><p>Males appear to be less susceptible to lice infestations than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>], and in the United States, black children are affected much less frequently than white children and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The reasons for these findings are uncertain. Studies investigating the impact of long hair length on the risk for infestation have yielded conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/3,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7</a>]. The lower incidence in black children in the United States may be related to a low prevalence of lice that are capable of grasping the shape or width of certain types of hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The life span of the female louse is about one month, during which she lays 7 to 10 eggs per day, cementing them firmly to the base of a host hair. The eggs, commonly called &quot;nits,&quot; are oval capsules that hatch in eight days, releasing nymphs that require another eight days to mature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74790%7EPC%2F56619\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74790 graphicRef56619 \">picture 1A-B</a>). After hatching, egg cases become white and more visible.</p><p>Adult head lice are gray-white, 2 to 3 mm in length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80788%7EDERM%2F104641\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80788 graphicRef104641 \">picture 2A-B</a>), and equipped with mouth parts adapted to sucking blood and legs adapted to grasping hairs. Adults feed both on the scalp and adjacent areas of the face and neck. Adult lice can survive up to 55 hours without a host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] but probably dehydrate and become nonviable long before their death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1257130\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct contact with the head of an infested person is the primary mode of transmission of pediculosis capitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. Lice do not jump, fly, or use pets as vectors.</p><p>The contribution of inanimate objects to the spread of pediculosis capitis is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. While a study performed in an experimental setting suggested that use of hair dryers, combs, or towels could lead to louse transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], other studies investigating the prevalence of lice on hats, bedding, and floors after exposure to an infested individual have not supported these routes as important modes of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pruritus occurs as an allergic reaction to lice saliva injected during feeding. In a patient without prior infestation, the onset of itching may be delayed until sensitization occurs after four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In addition to lice and nits, excoriations may be visible on the scalp, neck, and postauricular skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105400\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105400 \">picture 3</a>). Infrequently, secondary staphylococcal infection occurs with associated cervical or nuchal lymph node enlargement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediculosis capitis should be suspected in patients with scalp pruritus, particularly in children. Persistent pyoderma around the neck or ears should also stimulate an evaluation for pediculosis capitis.</p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed by the visualization of live lice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80788%7EDERM%2F104643\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80788 graphicRef104643 \">picture 2A, 2C</a>). Systematically combing wet or dry hair with a fine-toothed nit comb (teeth of comb 0.2 mm apart) better detects active louse infestation than visual inspection of the hair and scalp alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In a comparison study, a wet-combing technique resulted in a sensitivity of 91 percent for the detection of live lice, compared with a sensitivity of 29 percent observed with visual inspection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It has been suggested that wet combing is the most sensitive diagnostic technique; however, wet combing and dry combing have not been compared directly in clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>To perform wet combing, a lubricant such as a hair conditioner is applied to the hair prior to the following steps, which are also used for the dry-combing method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hair is brushed or combed to remove tangles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fine-toothed comb is inserted near the crown until it gently touches the scalp, after which it is drawn firmly down and examined for lice after each stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The entire head is combed systematically at least twice.</p><p/><p>Nits are often more easily found than nymphs and adult lice, which are elusive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65846%7EPC%2F74790%7EDERM%2F104642\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65846 graphicRef74790 graphicRef104642 \">picture 1A, 1C-D</a>). Unlike seborrheic scales, hair casts, and hair spray residue, nits are cemented securely to the hair shaft and are difficult to dislodge. Light microscopy can be used to confirm a nit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56619\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56619 \">picture 1B</a>). Examination with a Wood's lamp causes nits to fluoresce a pale blue and can facilitate harvest for microscopic examination. (See <a href=\"#H1023501\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the finding of nits without lice does not confirm active infestation. Nits can persist after successful therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Active infestation is suggested by the finding of many nits within one-quarter inch (6.5 mm) of the scalp; nits further from the scalp are almost always nonviable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, even this criterion results in overdiagnosis. As an example, in a study in which 1729 elementary school children were screened for lice, 28 (1.6 percent) had active lice while 63 (3.6 percent) had nits without lice, of whom 50 completed follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. During two weeks of follow-up, only 9 of the 50 children who initially had nits alone (18 percent) converted to an active infestation. Having &ge;5 nits within one-quarter inch of the scalp was associated with a higher conversion rate than fewer nits (32 versus 7 percent).</p><p>The diagnosis of lice is traumatic for some patients and parents and can lead to concern for continued infestation even after cure is complete. Tact, reassurance, and empathy on the part of the clinician are helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1023501\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nits should be distinguished from hair casts, white piedra, and black piedra.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hair casts </strong>&ndash; Hair casts (also known as pseudonits) are white to yellow, 2 to 7 mm, keratinous, tubular sheaths that encircle hair shafts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101623\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101623 \">picture 4</a>). Hair casts may be idiopathic (primary hair casts) or may occur in association with a scalp condition such as seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Unlike nits, hair casts slide easily along the hair shaft.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Piedra </strong>&ndash; Nits also should be distinguished from white and black piedra, fungal infections most commonly found in tropical areas that present with white to beige (white piedra) or brown to black (black piedra) concretions on hair shafts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69898%7EDERM%2F89954%7EDERM%2F89956\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69898 graphicRef89954 graphicRef89956 \">picture 5A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The concretions may reach up to a few millimeters in length. White piedra is caused by <em>Trichosporon</em> species, and black piedra is caused by <em>Piedraia hortae</em>. The nodules of white piedra tend to be soft and loosely adhered to the hair shaft, whereas black piedra nodules are hard and firmly attached. White piedra affects the face, axillae, and genitals more often than scalp hair. In contrast, black piedra is most likely to occur on scalp and facial hair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections due to Trichosporon species and Blastoschizomyces capitatus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>When the diagnosis is uncertain, microscopic examination of the hair can distinguish nits from piedra and hair casts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56619\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56619 \">picture 1B</a>). Moreover, in piedra, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of an involved area will reveal fungal elements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to pediculosis capitis, scalp pruritus may occur in multiple other scalp disorders, such as seborrheic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. The finding of nits or live lice distinguishes pediculosis capitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cradle-cap-and-seborrheic-dermatitis-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cradle cap and seborrheic dermatitis in infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seborrheic-dermatitis-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seborrheic dermatitis in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of pediculosis capitis is recommended. Topical pediculicides are the most common initial treatments. Manual removal of lice (wet combing) is sometimes used as an alternative to topical pediculicide therapy. Oral therapy is occasionally required for refractory infestations. </p><p>Regardless of the treatment selected, the presence of living lice should be confirmed prior to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with nits but no detectable nymphs or adult lice likely do not have active infection if nits are only found more than 6.5 mm from the scalp. These patients do not require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Many patients with nits less than 6.5 mm from the scalp and no detectable nymphs or adult lice also do not have active infestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Clinician approaches to these patients vary. Whereas some clinicians elect to treat based upon the possibility of missing live lice during the examination, others follow patients clinically for signs of active infestation to avoid unnecessary treatment.

Because there is marked geographical variability in the prevalence of pediculicide resistance, the selection of a topical pediculicide should involve consideration of local resistance patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/25-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-33</a>]. Consideration of agent-specific side effects, patient age, and treatment cost further influence treatment selection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resistance </strong>&ndash; A mutation in the louse kdr allele that results in decreased sensitivity of neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels has been proposed as the primary mechanism for pyrethroid resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Rates of kdr resistance appear to be high in the United States based upon a study in which over 14,000 lice were collected from 138 collection sites in 48 states and analyzed with quantitative sequencing for kdr mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the clinical relevance of kdr mutations is brought into question by a study that found a poor correlation between mutations in kdr and treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malathion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">malathion</a> occurs via increased production of enzymes that metabolize malathion and decreased sensitivity of neuronal acetylcholinesterase to the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other pathways for resistance also may be involved. Resistance to malathion appears to be less prevalent in the United States than in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is unclear whether this is due to the history of limited use of the drug in the United States or that the United States formulation of malathion also contains terpineol, a chemical with pediculicidal properties. In one in vitro study in Britain, fewer lice died after four hours of exposure to malathion 0.5% in isopropanol than after 30 minutes of exposure to the United States product (42 versus 96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mechanism of action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzyl-alcohol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzyl alcohol</a> (louse asphyxiation) may make it less susceptible to the development of resistance than the topical neurotoxic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Side effects and patient age</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malathion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Malathion</a> requires longer application times than other pediculicides and is malodorous.

Affected individuals may be asymptomatic or may complain of scalp or neck pruritus. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediculosis capitis is diagnosed by visual examination. In cases of active infestation, louse eggs (nits) are found on hair shafts, and crawling nymphs and adult lice are present. Wet combing is a useful technique for locating adult lice or nymphs. The presence of nits alone does <strong>not</strong> confirm active infestation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several topical pediculicides are available for the treatment of pediculosis capitis. Resistance to topical agents that kill lice via neurotoxic mechanisms has been increasingly reported and varies geographically. The selection of a topical agent should be based upon local resistance patterns and consideration of adverse effects and patient age. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lindane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lindane</a> is not recommended due to the potential for neurologic side effects and the drug's relatively low efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H1255275\" class=\"local\">'Topical pediculicides'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-line treatment options for pediculosis capitis include pyrethroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malathion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">malathion</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzyl-alcohol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzyl alcohol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinosad-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spinosad</a>, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105474 \">table 1</a>). The safety, low cost, and easy availability of pyrethroids have led to the widespread use of these drugs as initial agents. In areas in which pyrethroid resistance is not likely, we suggest use of a pyrethroid as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Malathion, benzyl alcohol, spinosad, and topical ivermectin are effective alternative therapies. (See <a href=\"#H1255275\" class=\"local\">'Topical pediculicides'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment failure may occur secondary to lack of adherence to the treatment regimen or reinfestation. Clinicians should consider these factors, in addition to the possibility of resistance, when evaluating patients with an apparent lack of response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1256506\" class=\"local\">'Refractory infestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with pediculosis capitis do not need to be excluded from school. Household members and close contacts should be examined for infestation. Individuals who share bedding with the affected person should be treated prophylactically. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Return to school'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Household recommendations'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediculosis-capitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ko CJ, Elston DM.
