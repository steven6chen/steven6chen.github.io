Numerous risk factors for intrapartum fever have been reported, such as nulliparity, prolonged labor, and premature rupture of membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These characteristics describe women likely to develop intraamniotic infection (IAI) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> receive epidural anesthesia, which are the two common causes of intrapartum fever. In the absence of a preexisting febrile disorder (eg, respiratory infection), most pregnant women who develop fever in labor are presumed to have IAI and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.</p><p>This topic will discuss the etiologies, management, and potential consequences of intrapartum fever. Intraamniotic infection (a major cause of intrapartum fever) and postpartum endometritis (a major cause of postpartum fever) are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intra-amniotic-infection-clinical-chorioamnionitis-or-triple-i\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intra-amniotic infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or triple I)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-endometritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum endometritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with elevated body temperature have fever, which occurs when the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is reset at a higher temperature by &quot;endogenous pyrogens&quot; produced by specific host cells in response to infection, inflammation, injury, or antigenic challenge. These pyrogenic polypeptides include the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and TNF-beta, and interferon alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>There are a few instances in which an elevated temperature represents hyperthermia rather than fever. As an example, some pharmacologic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, the recreational drug &quot;ecstasy&quot;) raise core temperature by blocking sweating or vasodilation without changing the normal hypothalamic set-point. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-fever-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the purposes of this discussion, the term fever will generally be used to describe maternal intrapartum temperature elevation from any mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever is defined as an elevation of body temperature above normal daily variation. The threshold for intrapartum fever has generally been considered to be maternal temperature &ge;38 degrees C (&ge;100.4 degrees F) orally. This is based, in part, on a study of temperature in normal parturients, which ranged from 34.6 to 37.6 degrees C (94.3 to 99.7 degrees F) upon admission to the labor unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There was a diurnal distribution, with a peak from midnight to 2 AM and a nadir from 11 AM to noon. </p><p>However, in 2016 an expert panel convened to address the diagnosis and management of pregnant women with intrapartum infection (called in this report &quot;triple I,&quot; which stands for intrauterine infection or inflammation or both) and their neonates recommended defining maternal fever as maternal temperature &ge;39&deg;C (&ge;102.2&deg;F) on one reading orally or &ge;38&deg;C (&ge;100.4&deg;F) and less than 39&deg;C (102.2&deg;F) on two readings 30 minutes apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Whether this definition will be widely accepted is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intra-amniotic-infection-clinical-chorioamnionitis-or-triple-i\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intra-amniotic infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or triple I)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of intrapartum fever varies widely. This variation is due to several factors, including differences in ascertainment (prospective studies report higher rates than retrospective studies), differences in prevalence of risk factors in the populations studied, use of different diagnostic criteria, and temporal changes in obstetric practice (eg, increased use of intrapartum antibiotics). The range of findings is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based study using data from birth and infant death certificates noted that intrapartum fever occurred in 1.6 percent of over 11 million singleton births in the United States between 1995 and 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrapartum fever has been reported to develop in 10 to 34 percent of nulliparous women who have epidural anesthesia during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We measure maternal temperature in the oral sublingual pocket with an electronic contact thermometer because it is accurate and the most convenient method for detecting intrapartum maternal fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Fetal/intrauterine</span> temperature is 0.2 to 0.9 degrees Celsius (0.4 to 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than maternal oral temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. </p><p>Large comparative studies of intrapartum techniques for measuring maternal temperature have not been performed. In one of the few small studies, oral temperature correlated better with <span class=\"nowrap\">intrauterine/core</span> temperature than tympanic membrane or skin temperature on the thigh or abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Good technique is important because mouth breathing, hyperventilation, ingestion of ice or hot beverages, and oxygen administration can affect oral temperature. One author suggested making sure that the mother has not been drinking fluids or ice in the 15 minutes before the temperature recording is made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Tympanic and axillary temperature measurements are particularly susceptible to user error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Noncontact tympanic temperature approximates core temperature, but may be inaccurate because of incorrect placement of the sensor in the ear canal or interference by cerumen. Axillary temperature is 1 to 2 degrees Celsius lower than oral temperature; an accurate measurement requires the probe to be positioned over the axillary artery and the arms positioned at the patient&rsquo;s side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful history and physical examination should be performed to look for potential causes, both obstetrical and non-obstetrical, of fever. Risk factors for intraamniotic infection (IAI) include prolonged labor, prolonged membrane rupture, multiple digital vaginal examinations (especially with ruptured membranes), and exposure to intrauterine devices (eg, intrauterine pressure catheter, fetal scalp electrode). Urinary tract, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms suggest a bacterial or viral infection that may have started antepartum, such as pyelonephritis or a virus associated with the common cold, or more rarely pneumonia, listeriosis, <em>C. difficile</em>&nbsp;colitis, or appendicitis. Antepartum medications should be noted, since drug fever can present several days after initiation of a medication. (See individual topic reviews on these disorders). </p><p>The use of intrapartum epidural anesthesia is important since it is associated with intrapartum fever. (See <a href=\"#H483714642\" class=\"local\">'Use of epidural anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p>The physical examination should include standard vital signs, auscultation of the lungs, and assessment of fundal tenderness, abdominal tenderness, costovertebral angle tenderness, and the character of amniotic fluid (eg, odor).</p><p>The fetal heart rate and pattern should be evaluated. Fetal tachycardia may occur in response to maternal fever or intrauterine infection. However, a category I fetal heart rate pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57583 \">table 1</a>) does not reliably exclude <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> infection and no pattern is specific for intrauterine infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing is not routinely performed, but should be guided by the suspected diagnosis (eg, urinary tract infection, influenza).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3141696\"><span class=\"h3\">White blood cell (WBC) count and differential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest obtaining a WBC count in patients who appear clinically ill or with a temperature &ge;39 degrees C (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit). The value of an intrapartum WBC count is limited because high values normally occur during labor. Data from two series reported mean WBC counts in laboring patients of 10,000 to 16,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> with an upper level as high as 29,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]; the mean count increased linearly with the duration of elapsed labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, when clinical concern about infection is high, leukocytosis (especially when accompanied by a left shift or bandemia) supports the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3141704\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usefulness of blood cultures has not been studied specifically in intrapartum women and there are no published standards for when to obtain intrapartum cultures. We suggest blood cultures for women who appear clinically ill or with temperature &ge;39 degrees C (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Our approach is based on the observation that the frequency of positive blood cultures increases as temperature increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>] and appropriate antibiotic therapy is important in bacteremic patients because untreated bacteremia can lead to sepsis and shock, although these serious sequelae are rare in <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnant/postpartum</span> women in developed countries, who tend to be young and healthy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Experts have suggested the following potential indications for blood cultures: fever &ge;39 degrees C (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit), chills, hypothermia, leukocytosis with left shift, neutropenia, and the development of otherwise unexplained organ dysfunction (eg, renal failure, shock) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In one study of peripartum women, 63 percent of those with positive blood cultures had fevers &ge;39 degrees C (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study of peripartum women, laboratory-confirmed bacteremia was found in 5.1 percent of women with axillary temperature &ge;38 degrees C (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other clinical indications of systemic infection (eg, elevated C-reactive protein levels or leukocytosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a third study of peripartum women, bacteremia was predicted by temperature &gt;103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees C), respiratory rate &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">respirations/minute,</span> maternal heart rate &gt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute,</span> and bandemia &gt;10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood cultures for the detection of bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although IAI is a concern in women with intrapartum fever, blood cultures are not routinely performed in women with suspected IAI. The treatment of IAI is delivery and antibiotic therapy, and empiric therapy is effective in 85 to 90 percent of these patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Intraamniotic infection (chorioamnionitis)'</a> below.)</p><p>For suspected pyelonephritis, blood cultures are less useful than urine cultures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Acute pyelonephritis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3141712\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary dipstick testing is fast, convenient, and low in cost. The specimen can be obtained from a clean catch midstream urine collection, via a straight catheter, or from an indwelling catheter. It is considered positive if either leukocyte esterase or nitrite is detected: positive leukocyte esterase indicates pyuria and positive nitrite indicates the presence of enteric organisms that convert urinary nitrate to nitrite. For either finding, sensitivity and specificity for infection are 50 and 97 percent, respectively, thus there is a high false negative rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. We suggest confirmation with urine microscopy and urine culture if the patient is clinically ill or with temperature &ge;39 degrees C (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Urine culture is not practical as a first-line diagnostic test when a woman is in labor since results may take 24 to 48 hours after collection.

Although amniotic fluid IL-6 and IL-8 levels are significantly elevated with IAI, optimal threshold values for diagnosis of intrauterine infection have not been established and these diagnostic markers are also not used clinically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON ETIOLOGIES AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common etiologies of intrapartum fever are intraamniotic infection (IAI) and use of epidural anesthesia. Management depends on the etiology, if an etiology can be documented. Because intrapartum fever is the key clinical sign of IAI and no intrapartum clinical or laboratory findings reliably distinguish between IAI and epidural-related maternal temperature elevation, antibiotics for treatment of IAI are usually administered when maternal temperature is &ge;38 degrees C (&ge;100.4 degrees F) orally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95638\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef95638 \">algorithm 1</a>).

It has been attributed to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A primary sterile inflammatory response either in the placenta or in the epidural space (followed by secondary placental inflammation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/2,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37-39</a>]. This is the most likely etiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraamniotic infection. Use of epidural analgesia and intraamniotic infection share risk factors such as nulliparity, induction of labor, internal monitoring, more vaginal examinations, longer labor, and longer duration of rupture of membranes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced heat loss. Laboring women with epidural analgesia have less pain-induced hyperventilation and less perspiration because of sympathetic block, which may reduce heat loss. On the other hand, vasodilation below the level of epidural blockade increases heat loss and is typically associated with a slight decrease in core temperature in non-pregnant patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormality in maternal thermoregulation. A temperature increase has also been reported to occur in non-pregnant patients receiving prolonged postoperative epidural analgesia; thus, it is not necessarily related to pregnancy and labor per se [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, it is most common in laboring women.</p><p/><p>Data from a historical cohort study of maternal temperature before and after availability of epidural analgesia suggest that the epidural itself is most likely the cause of the increased maternal temperature. When epidural usage increased from 1 percent to 83 percent, the incidence of maternal temperature &ge;100.4 degrees F abruptly increased from 0.6 percent to 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Nonpregnant populations do not experience epidural-related fever, possibly because of inhibition of fever by inhaled anesthetic agents&nbsp;and use of opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Most laboring women do not experience an increase in temperature following epidural analgesia, but for those who do, the rise in maternal temperature occurs immediately. Temperature increases average 0.33 degrees <span class=\"nowrap\">F/hour</span> (0.18 degrees C) and are statistically significantly higher than baseline by one hour after catheter placement; an overall increased incidence of fever &ge;38 C appears by four hours of exposure and increases with increasing duration of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Nulliparous women are more likely to have longer labors and are more likely to have intrapartum fever than multiparas; the risk of epidural fever in nulliparas is 13 to 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>There is no proven safe and effective method for preventing epidural-related temperature elevation. Shortening labor by optimal use of oxytocin may be useful since the risk of intrapartum fever increases over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Anesthetic choice may play a role, but this requires further study. In one retrospective cohort study, for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> was associated with less intrapartum fever than levobupivacaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The specific technique may also be a factor; however, a randomized trial found no difference in mean maximum maternal temperature between early combined spinal epidural versus delayed epidural (after 4 cm dilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Neither prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> nor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> prevent the maternal temperature elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. In a randomized trial, high-dose systemic corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 100 mg every four hours) prevented maternal temperature elevation (incidence of fever 2 versus 34 percent in untreated controls), but was associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteremia in neonates (4 of 49 neonates versus 0 of 120 control neonates) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In another randomized trial, the addition of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> to the epidural maintenance solution mitigated increases in both maternal temperature and interleukin (IL)-6 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These latter two trials support the hypothesis that a catheter or drugs in the epidural space induce a maternal inflammatory response in laboring women that results in fever and can be prevented by local or systemic steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, steroid use cannot be recommended until safety and efficacy for this indication have been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482697973\"><span class=\"h4\">Newborn issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increase in maternal temperature associated with epidural analgesia is associated with an increased rate of neonatal sepsis investigations and antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], but is not associated with an increased rate of proven neonatal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a retrospective analysis, only 4 of 416 neonates evaluated were found to be septic, raising questions regarding the clinical criteria used to trigger such evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>The appropriate evaluation and management of the newborn following observation of maternal intrapartum fever is unclear. The decision to perform a neonatal septic work-up should be guided by factors in addition to maternal temperature, such as gestational age and maternal and neonatal clinical findings. Triggers for septic work-up in neonates include low birth weight, prematurity, hypothermia at birth, maternal group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal colonization, preeclampsia, and maternal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, the clinician should note whether epidural analgesia was administered for a prolonged length of time and whether a rapid fall in maternal temperature occurred after the epidural was discontinued, which supports but does not prove epidural anesthesia as the source of maternal fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Ongoing monitoring of asymptomatic newborn infants with risk factors for infection is important so that early signs and symptoms of sepsis are identified.

Intrapartum temperature elevation in these women was attributed to epidural anesthesia. Compared to infants of women with no intrapartum temperature elevation, infants of women with temperature elevation were significantly more likely to have a low one-minute Apgar score (&lt;7) (22.8 versus 8 percent), hypotonia (4.8 versus 0.5 percent), require bag and mask resuscitation (11.5 versus 3 percent), and be given oxygen therapy (8.2 versus 1.3 percent). These infants also had a three-fold increased risk of unexplained neonatal seizures, although seizures were rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fever/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
