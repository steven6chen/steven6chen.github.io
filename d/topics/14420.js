PV is distinguished from other MPNs by the presence of an elevated red blood cell mass (ie, erythrocytosis), and is associated with an increased risk for thromboembolic events, leukemic transformation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myelofibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the prognosis and treatment of PV.

(See <a href=\"#H1424913243\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>While not curative, modern therapy for PV can relieve symptoms and prolong survival. The goals of care are to reduce the risk of first <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent thrombosis, prevent bleeding events, ameliorate the symptom burden, and minimize the risk of evolution to post-PV myelofibrosis (MF) and acute myeloid <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/myelodysplastic</span> syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(AML/MDS)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-polycythemia-vera/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>While no drug has been shown to lower the risk of hematologic transformation to MF or <span class=\"nowrap\">AML/MDS,</span> current treatment approaches generally avoid agents known to increase this risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3925894786\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with PV should have a complete history and physical examination that documents symptoms, signs, and laboratory studies that may alter prognosis or management strategy. </p><p>It is our practice to include an evaluation of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of venous or arterial thrombosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of symptoms including pruritus, erythromelalgia, fevers, sweats, weight loss, early satiety, fatigue, headaches, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, atypical chest pain, and paresthesias</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, abnormal lipids, obesity, and active tobacco use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings of bleeding or bruising and assessment of spleen and liver size by physical examination </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count with differential, review of the peripheral blood smear, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral blood should be tested for <em>JAK2</em> V617F mutation and, if negative, for mutations of <em>CALR</em> exon 9 and <em>MPL</em> exon 10</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for acquired von Willebrand disease in patients with clinical evidence of bleeding or platelet counts &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">million/microL</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome#H1205520081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired von Willebrand syndrome&quot;, section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow biopsy, including assessment of reticulin fibrosis, percent of CD34-positive cells, karyotype, and molecular genetics studies (if not previously performed on peripheral blood)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2797858499\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK STRATIFIED MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3689165403\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of PV is guided by a risk-adapted approach that is based on age (ie, &le;60 versus &gt;60 years) and history of prior thrombosis.

Overall survival of treated patients with PV is inferior to that of an age- and sex-matched normal population. (See <a href=\"#H1424913243\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The goals of care in patients with PV are to reduce the risk of thrombosis, ameliorate symptom burden, and minimize the risk of evolution to post-PV myelofibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute myeloid <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/myelodysplastic</span> syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(AML/MDS)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3793990320\" class=\"local\">'Goals of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be evaluated for a history of thrombotic events (venous and arterial), PV-associated symptoms (eg, pruritus, erythromelalgia, bleeding), cardiovascular risk factors, splenomegaly, <em>JAK2</em> V617F mutation (in peripheral blood or bone marrow), and bone marrow fibrosis. (See <a href=\"#H3925894786\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with PV should be stratified according to risk factors for survival (eg, age &gt;60, prior thrombosis, leukocytosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90725\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90725 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3689165403\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with PV, we recommend maintenance of hematocrit &lt;45 percent, rather than higher target hematocrits (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Some experts suggest a target hematocrit of &lt;45 percent in men and &lt;42 percent in women. (See <a href=\"#H1619716220\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic phlebotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Phlebotomy is the mainstay of management of red blood cell mass in PV.

Higher doses of aspirin are not well studied, but appear to be associated with higher risk of bleeding.

(See <a href=\"#H3329154027\" class=\"local\">'Management of low-risk PV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with high-risk PV (&gt;60 years <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> history of thrombosis), we recommend phlebotomy plus cytoreductive therapy rather than phlebotomy alone.
