Bronchiolitis typically occurs with primary infection or reinfection with a viral pathogen, but occasionally is caused by bacteria (eg, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae)</em>. In young children, the clinical syndrome of bronchiolitis may overlap with recurrent virus-induced wheezing and acute viral-triggered asthma. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis, virus-induced wheezing, and acute viral-triggered asthma are discussed separately.

However, it should not be the only criterion. Observational studies suggest that episodes of desaturation with mild to moderate respiratory distress are common in infants with bronchiolitis and that detection of hypoxemia may be associated with increased health care utilization (eg, supplemental oxygen, admission, increased length of stay) but little or no acute benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention/abstract/4,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10-12</a>]. The effect of brief periods of hypoxemia caused by bronchiolitis on the developing brain has not been adequately addressed.</p><p>In an observational study, the families of 118 otherwise healthy infants (6 weeks to 12 months) who were born at &gt;36 weeks' gestation and discharged home from the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis were provided with a portable oxygen saturation monitor that recorded SpO<sub>2</sub> but neither displayed saturation values nor sounded alarms for threshold values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Based on clinical characteristics at discharge from the emergency department, these infants had mild to moderate bronchiolitis that did not require hospitalization. Approximately two-thirds of infants had at least one episode of SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90 percent for at least one minute; one-half had at least three episodes; and 43 percent had SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90 percent continuously for &ge;3 minutes. Episodes of desaturation typically occurred during sleep or while feeding. The rates of unscheduled medical visits and hospitalizations for bronchiolitis within 72 hours of discharge from the emergency department were similar among infants with and without desaturations (approximately 25 percent and &lt;5 percent, respectively). Information beyond 72 hours post-discharge was not collected, which is a limitation of the study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91755587\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSEVERE BRONCHIOLITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87662813\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and children with nonsevere bronchiolitis usually can be managed in the outpatient setting, unless there are concerns about the caregivers' ability to care for them at home. (See <a href=\"#H87662200\" class=\"local\">'Indications for hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p>Supportive care and anticipatory guidance are the mainstays of management of nonsevere bronchiolitis.

Randomized trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses do not support the benefits of bronchodilators (inhaled or oral) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>], glucocorticoids (inhaled or systemic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention/abstract/1,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19-24</a>], or leukotriene inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
