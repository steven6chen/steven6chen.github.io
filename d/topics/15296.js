It causes a fever that lasts 3 to 5 days and then a rash. Roseola can be alarming to parents, because it can cause a high fever. But usually, the condition is not serious and goes away without treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663306\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of roseola?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms of roseola are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Might get as high as 104&deg;F (40&deg;C) or above</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lasts 3 to 5 days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76269 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Starts as the fever is going away</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shows up first on the neck, chest, and belly, then spreads to the face, arms, and legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is pinkish-red in color</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Normally does not itch</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lasts for 1 to 2 days in most children, but might come and go within 2 to 4 hours</p><p/><p>Despite the fever and rash, most children with roseola do not seem sick. Still, some children have other symptoms such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being fussy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not being hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen eyelids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the neck or behind the ears</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663322\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When your child has a fever you can do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer him or her lots of fluids to drink. Call the doctor or nurse if your child won't or can't drink fluids for more than a few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage your child to rest as much as he or she wants.</p><p/><p>Medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can help bring down a fever. But children don't usually need medicine for a fever unless they are uncomfortable. Check with your doctor or nurse about giving medicine for a fever.</p><p><strong>Never</strong> give your child <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. Aspirin can cause a dangerous condition called Reye syndrome in children under 18 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663337\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should take your child to see the doctor or nurse is he or she is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger than 3 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4&ordm;F (38&ordm;C) or higher.
