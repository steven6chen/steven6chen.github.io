Clinician-supervised oral food challenges remain the gold standard and are often required to confirm or rule out the diagnosis because of the limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of the other methods available.</p><p>Improved or new testing methodologies are needed for determining the presence and severity of a food allergy and the likelihood of resolution of an allergy. This topic reviews improvements in available diagnostic tools and new testing methods that are in development. Current diagnostic tools are discussed separately, as is the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected food allergy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of medical testing for food allergy must be thought of in the context of the suspected mechanism of pathogenesis (ie, immunoglobulin E (IgE) or non-IgE mediated) and the limitations of available testing. IgE-mediated food allergy is more common, better understood, and more actively researched. There is also active research on testing for non-IgE-mediated and &quot;IgE-associated&quot; diseases that are believed to be driven, wholly or partly, by dietary proteins (eg, eosinophilic esophagitis [EoE], atopic dermatitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a persistent and wide gap between the number of individuals who believe they have food allergies and the true prevalence (approximately 30 and 5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Part of this discrepancy stems from confusion regarding allergic (ie, immune-mediated) reactions versus other adverse reactions to foods. Diagnostic test limitations, including the low specificity of specific IgE for true allergy (particularly when used qualitatively), also contribute to overdiagnosis.</p><p>Research efforts are focused on improving diagnostic tests and on developing tests that have better prognostic performance. To address limitations, investigators are attempting to characterize the patient immune response in ever greater detail to find phenotypes that more closely correlate with the clinical disease aspect of interest.</p><p>Instead of measuring the IgE response to complex allergen extracts, investigators are evaluating the specificity of that response on the level of individual allergens (&quot;component resolved diagnosis&quot;) or the epitopes of those allergens (&quot;epitope mapping&quot; or &quot;profiling&quot;). They are measuring the fraction of total IgE that is allergen specific, the affinity of the allergen-specific IgE, and the presence and specificity of other, potentially inhibitory, antibodies (eg, immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]). Methods of assessing the patient's effector cell response to allergen (eg, &quot;basophil activation testing&quot; [BAT]) are also under investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several technical developments have gone hand-in-hand with the search for better diagnostic tools for food allergy. Current diagnostic techniques based upon crude allergen extracts suffer from several factors affecting specificity, including potential cross-contamination with other allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and the presence of highly cross-reactive carbohydrate epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There has been a massive effort to identify, clone, and express major allergens from hundreds of sources. Assays are also being developed in tandem with the molecular characterization of allergens. As an example, microarray-based assays allow numerous proteins to be probed simultaneously, thus requiring minute amounts of patient serum. In addition, recombinant allergens can be used for traditional skin prick testing (SPT) or other functional tests, such as basophil activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergen microarrays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of microarrays for food allergy diagnosis has two direct applications: evaluation of sensitization to multiple allergens using protein arrays and evaluation of allergen epitope recognition patterns using peptide arrays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Protein allergen microarrays have been developed with up to 5000 allergens on a single assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/5-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-13</a>]. Overall, microarray assays correlate well with serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) measurements, although they tend to be somewhat less sensitive. There are a few protein microarray panels that focus on food allergy specifically, although none have US Food and Drug Administration approval yet. This approach is promising, but more prospective studies showing clinical application need to be performed.</p><p>Epitope pattern analysis by microarray has been applied to food allergy. However, existing literature on the correlation between epitope recognition and clinical reactivity or prognosis is scant. Several studies linking epitope recognition patterns and clinical allergy using methods other than peptide and protein microarray have been performed previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Microarray is a versatile tool to define and identify binding patterns and informative epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>An advantage of the microarray approach is that it allows for practical, whole-sequence epitope analysis, using individual patient serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. As an example, in the case of peanut allergy, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in epitope recognition that is not practical to measure with older methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Additional innovations include multiple antibody isotype detection using different fluorochrome channels and more sophisticated statistical analyses that can detect multiple epitopes recognized by a population of patients even when the epitopes share overlapping sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Microarray technology allows for evaluation of a patient's B cell repertoire to a given set of allergens. Peptide and protein microarrays may be particularly useful in better understanding associated antibody repertoire changes in both natural and immunotherapy-induced tolerance.</p><p>One major disadvantage of the existing technology has been its limitation to linear, sequential epitopes. Additional recombinant-based approaches have begun to address this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As an example, the microarray technique was employed in investigation of conformational food allergen epitopes, determining IgE clustering epitopes on recombinant alpha-lactalbumin in patients with cow&rsquo;s milk allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Preventative and therapeutic strategies can be developed based upon these mapped IgE epitopes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Basophil activation testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basophils are specifically sensitized effector cells that are readily accessible from the peripheral blood. Basophil responsiveness may have higher specificity than specific IgE testing when judging clinical reactivity because activation of these cells is a biologic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These tests use either autologous donor cells or cells from established cell lines.</p><p>The most common form of the basophil activation test (BAT) involves direct activation with antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Flow cytometry is used to identify the population of basophils and measure their activation based upon upregulation of cell-surface proteins (eg, CD63 and CD203c) that are associated with release of mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">IgE-MEDIATED FOOD ALLERGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A key concept regarding immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy is the distinction between sensitization and allergy. Sensitization refers to the presence of IgE capable of binding to a particular antigen, as evidenced by detection in serum by an allergen binding assay or indirectly by mast cell degranulation induced by skin prick testing (SPT). Mast cell activation by non-IgE-mediated mechanisms is theoretically possible with SPT, but this is not regarded as a common problem, unlike with drug allergy. Nonspecific IgE binding and technical restrictions are potential limitations of serum binding assays.</p><p>More fundamentally, however, production of specific IgE is necessary for immediate hypersensitivity but is not sufficient for clinical allergy. Individuals may have positive testing (SPT or in vitro) and yet fully tolerate the antigen in the diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9178323\"><span class=\"h3\">Component-resolved diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several plant foods contain proteins that are homologous to plant aeroallergens. This cross-reactivity contributes to the overdiagnosis of food allergies because it results in positive tests that may not be clinically relevant. A &quot;component-resolved&quot; or &quot;molecular allergen&quot; diagnostic approach, in which specific IgE is measured to defined allergens individually rather than as a whole extract, can enhance specificity and improve understanding of cross-reactivity and cosensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Component-resolved testing is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component testing for pollen-related, plant-derived food allergies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-testing-for-animal-derived-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component testing for animal-derived food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19982316\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergen epitope profiling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food allergens must at least partially survive digestion and absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to be immunogenic. This fact has led to the hypothesis that individuals who have IgE antibodies recognizing a greater number or a specific pattern of sequential epitopes (eg, those not easily destroyed by denaturation and partial digestion) are more likely to have clinical allergy rather than asymptomatic IgE sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Multiple studies have found correlations between epitope patterns, defined using peptides, and clinical disease. Examples of investigations supporting the concept that IgE epitope-recognition patterns can predict clinical outcomes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Researchers analyzed IgE binding of eight sequential epitopes of the major peanut allergens, Ara h 1, 2, and 3. Ninety-three percent (n = 14) of patients with clinical reactivity to peanut recognized at least one of the immunodominant epitopes of Ara h 1 or 2 in contrast to 12 percent (n = 2) of peanut-tolerant subjects with IgE sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Furthermore, reactive patients recognized a greater number of epitopes than tolerant patients. Testing for IgE-binding epitopes may decrease the need for oral challenges to determine if sensitized patients are clinically reactive or tolerant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another group identified specific epitopes of major wheat allergens, omega-5 gliadin and a high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit, that were recognized by 97 percent (n = 29) of patients with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis but were not recognized by wheat-sensitized patients with atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>However, one study has provided evidence that short sequential epitopes contribute little to IgE binding to two major food allergens, Ara h 2 and Pen a 1, from peanut and shrimp, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19982323\"><span class=\"h3\">Cellular/functional assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of the basophil activation test (BAT) in food allergy diagnosis is increasingly under investigation. One study examined its performance for predicting challenge outcomes in a group of 71 children with egg or milk allergy previously diagnosed by challenge or convincing history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Performance characteristics using optimal cutoff points were comparable with earlier studies following the same design for skin or IgE testing. Similar results were seen in children with peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Other studies suggest that BAT is also comparable with skin or in vitro (CAP-FEIA)-specific IgE testing in its ability to distinguish clinical allergy from sensitization alone in patients with food pollen allergy syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. One study examined the use of BAT with recombinant allergens for the diagnosis of food allergy in three groups of 20 birch-allergic patients with clinical allergy to apple, carrot, or celery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Using the recombinant profilin allergens (Mal d 1, Dau c 1, and Api g 1), they achieved sensitivities and specificities of 75 and 68 percent, 75 and 77 percent, and 65 and 100 percent for apple, carrot, and celery, respectively. These results were comparable with CAP-FEIA but less sensitive than prick-prick skin testing using fresh fruit or vegetable.</p><p>BAT may also help differentiate between sensitization and clinical allergy in patients with a history of clinical reactivity to one food allergen and a positive test to another cross-reactive allergen. Ses i 6 is a seed storage protein that has partial immunologic cross-reactivity with a walnut protein, Jug r 4. Basophils passively sensitized with sera from sesame-allergic, walnut-sensitized patients are activated by Ses i 6 but not Jug r 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>T cell responses to food allergens may also eventually prove useful in determining if a patient is sensitized or clinically allergic. As an example, T cell proliferation to crude peanut extract and major peanut allergens was studied in children with peanut allergy (n = 18) or peanut sensitization (n = 7) and nonallergic adults (n = 11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The T cell response to crude peanut extract was stronger in children with peanut allergy than those with peanut sensitization or adults without peanut allergy. Only the children with peanut allergy had detectable interleukin (IL)-13 production in response to major peanut allergens (Ara h 1, Ara h 3, and Ara h 6).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19982330\"><span class=\"h3\">Other diagnostic assessments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various eosinophil mediators, including eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in serum or stool, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) or eosinophil protein X (EPX) in urine, have been proposed for the diagnosis of food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The utility of these tests remains to be seen. They may prove more useful in diagnosing non-IgE-mediated eosinophilic inflammatory disorders, such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Non-IgE-mediated or mixed food allergy'</a> below.)</p><p>Nonencoding microRNAs (miRNAs) are other potential EoE biomarkers. Some of these miRNAs are differentially expressed in EoE, either constitutively or specifically with inflammation, compared with normal healthy controls and those with reflux esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Several of these miRNAs are detectable in peripheral blood, making them promising noninvasive alternatives to endoscopic biopsy for diagnosing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> monitoring disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beyond accurate diagnosis of food allergy, there are some closely related prognostic questions confronting food-allergic patients, their families, and healthcare providers. Two of the most common questions are: &quot;Who is at risk for anaphylaxis?&quot; and, for children, &quot;Will the allergy be outgrown?&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to identify those at higher risk for severe reactions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reactive at lower thresholds of peanut exposure would potentially allow for more efficient targeting of resources to those individuals. However, reaction severity cannot be reliably predicted from food-specific serum IgE concentrations. As in the case of accurate diagnosis, cross-reactivity between inhalant and food proteins has a large impact on the poor association between measured specific IgE to whole allergen source extracts and the clinical phenotype.</p><p>Additional reasons for poor reliability of food-specific serum IgE concentrations in determining allergy severity may include variability in target organ sensitivity (eg, the presence of asthma, which is associated with more severe reactions), the patient's general health, and the dose of allergen ingested.</p><p>Some studies with larger samples or more homogeneous study populations have found a greater risk of severe reactions in those with higher peanut-specific IgE concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19982337\"><span class=\"h4\">Component-resolved diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern of specific IgE reactivity to defined allergens can help define risk for anaphylaxis for at least some allergens, such as peanut. As an example, sensitization to pollen-related proteins, such as Bet v 1 homologues (PR-10 proteins) or profilins, is generally associated with limited (oropharyngeal) reactivity, whereas sensitization to more stable proteins, such as the seed storage or lipid transfer proteins, is often associated with systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/26,45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,45-49</a>]. The usefulness of component testing for animal food allergens (eg, milk, egg) is less well established. Component testing is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component testing for pollen-related, plant-derived food allergies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-testing-for-animal-derived-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component testing for animal-derived food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Attempts to determine the probability of a positive challenge based upon raw IgE values versus specific to total IgE levels have not been successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19982344\"><span class=\"h4\">Allergen epitope profiling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive relationship between the diversity of the IgE response to both peanut and milk proteins and reaction severity has been demonstrated. The total number of peanut or milk proteins (epitopes) recognized by patient IgE directly correlates with severity of clinical symptoms during the respective food challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>Similarly, in a retrospective study, IgE from patients with more severe reactions recognized a greater number of peanut allergen epitopes compared with those who had milder reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In these same subjects, commercially available tests for peanut-specific IgE levels did not distinguish between the two groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19982351\"><span class=\"h4\">Cellular/functional assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BAT may be useful for identifying patients with a more severe phenotype of food allergy. As an example, basophils of patients with more persistent and severe milk allergy had basophils that were more reactive to milk in vivo, whereas natural resolution of the allergy was associated with basophil suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. BAT can also discriminate between children with cow&rsquo;s milk allergy that is still present and those who have outgrown their cow&rsquo;s milk allergy but are still sensitized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In addition, BAT is useful in the identification of different allergy phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Prospective studies are needed to validate this observation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease persistence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important question for patients and clinicians managing the allergic patient is whether or not the allergy is likely to persist. Differences in patient IgE responses may be helpful in making this determination. This will be increasingly important as new therapies become available that focus on patients not likely to outgrow their allergy spontaneously.

However, neither the sensitivity nor the specificity of the IgE testing is certain. In addition, the causative role of food antigens in these conditions is not universally accepted, although, at least for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the evidence is strong.

Patient skin is exposed to allergen for prolonged periods (usually 48 hours), and reactions are generally interpreted at 72 hours. Patch testing is the gold standard for the assessment of contact allergen sensitization, but is only recently being evaluated for food allergies. The atopy patch test (APT) has been applied to both IgE-associated (eg, atopic dermatitis and allergic eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders) and non-IgE-associated conditions (eg, FPIES).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Atopic dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have examined the use of the APT in children with atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/66-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-74</a>].</p><p>One of the early studies examining the utility of patch testing in children with atopic dermatitis compared traditional skin testing, serum IgE testing, and patch testing to the results of 133 double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, 77 of which were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The APT was positive in 55 percent of patients with positive food challenges (42 of 77), whereas IgE testing was positive in approximately 85 percent. However, in the 21 patients who experienced only late-onset symptoms (eg, worsening eczema greater than two hours following challenge), patch testing was superior to either serum IgE measurement or skin prick testing (SPT). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value for patch testing for these delayed reactions were 81 percent and 93 percent, respectively, compared with approximately 40 percent and 75 percent for IgE-based testing.</p><p>A study investigating the role of APT in the diagnosis of food additive hypersensitivity in children with atopic dermatitis identified carmine as a potential trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Similarly, other studies have concluded that patch testing is more sensitive for the diagnosis of food-associated atopic dermatitis, particularly in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. However, one smaller study failed to show that the APT improved the diagnostic accuracy of detecting egg-associated eczema over SPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Another study found increased sensitivity but at the cost of lower specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The authors concluded that combined testing was most beneficial.</p><p>The addition of the APT is unlikely to significantly reduce the need for oral food challenges, even though combined testing (APT plus SPT or specific IgE measurement) has improved sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal food allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of patch testing has also been investigated in children with gastrointestinal symptoms, including those with a diagnosis of allergic eosinophilic esophagitis (AEE, more commonly called just eosinophilic esophagitis [EoE or EE]) or allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis (AEG or EG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/73,74,76-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74,76-82</a>]. The use of APT in the diagnosis and management of EoE is discussed in detail separately. Its utility in other gastrointestinal disorders is discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-management-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary management of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity of APT for diagnosing food allergy-related gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly in one study when fresh foods were used for testing, rather than commercial food extracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Sensitivity for fresh food versus commercial extract, respectively, was 64 percent versus 6 percent for cow's milk and 84 percent versus 5 percent for hen's egg. In this study, the specificity of APT was high regardless of the preparation used for testing (95 percent for cow's milk and 100 percent for hen's egg). Results from another study suggest that a ready-to-use APT for cow's milk may have better sensitivity and test accuracy than an APT prepared in clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Overall, further study is needed to confirm the utility of patch testing in the diagnosis of specific food allergies in eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-gastroenteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic gastroenteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A retrospective study evaluated patients with gastrointestinal milk allergy diagnosed by elimination followed by oral challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. These patients' symptoms were largely consistent with EoE or AEG, although they did not have biopsy-confirmed diagnoses. Of the 35 patients, 24 were found to be milk allergic by challenge. Only three of these patients had milk-specific IgE, but 19 of 24 were patch-test positive. Among the non-cow's milk allergic-group (n = 11), none were IgE positive and one was patch-test positive, resulting in sensitivity and specificity of 79 percent and 91 percent, respectively for the APT.</p><p>A study of 19 patients suspected of FPIES compared results of patch testing with open challenge results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Twelve of these patients had positive reactions to a total of 16 foods. In all, 33 challenges were compared with patch test results. The patch test had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 percent and 71 percent, respectively. APT will be a significant tool for the safe introduction of foods in children diagnosed with FPIES if this high degree of sensitivity holds true in larger studies.

Patients with late-onset milk reactions and negative-specific IgE testing produce higher levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma than either tolerant controls or IgE-mediated reactors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from infants with delayed gastrointestinal symptoms due to milk secrete large amounts of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, peaking at days 1 and 5 after stimulation with cow's milk proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Infants with immediate hypersensitivity symptoms have peak TNF-alpha secretion at 24 hours but low levels by day 5. Changes in PBMC responses in patients who have outgrown their gastrointestinal allergy to milk may be related to the induction of tolerance-inducing regulatory T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>The relationship between the gastrointestinal allergic symptoms of patients in these studies and the well-defined clinical syndrome FPIES is not entirely clear, and this work has not been widely replicated. In addition, T cell-based tests are relatively laborious and require skilled technicians.
