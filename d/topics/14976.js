The three cell types appear to be derived from pericytes. This is suggested by the fact that they all express pericyte markers (angiotensin II type 1 receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, desmin, alpha<em>-</em>smooth muscle actin, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] receptor 2) but not the endothelial cell marker CD31 or the adipocyte marker S-100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>AMLs may be sporadic or associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or, less commonly, sporadic pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).

The major features of the classic variant include abnormally thick-walled vessels that lack a well-developed internal elastic lamina and varying amounts of spindle smooth-muscle-like cells and adipose tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90669\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90669 \">picture 1</a>). Any one of the three cell types (ie, smooth-muscle-like cells, adipocyte-like cells, and epithelioid cells) may predominate or be virtually absent. In general, epithelioid cells are sparse and make up fewer than 10 percent of cells in the classic variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Classic AMLs are benign but can be locally invasive, extending into the perirenal fat or, rarely, the collecting system, renal vein, or inferior vena cava and right atrium.

There is no consensus on the percentage of epithelioid cells that is required to make a diagnosis of the epithelioid variant, with values ranging from 10 to 100 percent in published studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>].

These markers help to differentiate this lesion from other renal cystic renal neoplasms such as multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, cystic nephroma, and mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of the kidney.

The frequency of detection in the general population is increasing because of an increase in the use of imaging and advances in imaging technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/4,6,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,15-18</a>]. Using population-based ultrasound screening, a Japanese study of almost 18,000 healthy adults identified renal AMLs in 0.1 percent of men and 0.2 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A later study using multidetector contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) reported AMLs in 2.2 percent of 1948 potential kidney donors (mean age 43 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Renal AMLs are more common in women than men and are typically discovered in middle age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Thus, although the prevalence of AMLs is low among patients who do not have TSC or LAM, the prevalence of sporadic AML markedly exceeds the estimated birth incidence of TSC or LAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Occasionally, patients present with impaired renal function due to slow, chronic impingement of the AMLs on normal tissue.</p><p>Among symptomatic patients, flank pain is probably most commonly described. In a retrospective analysis of 129 patients, 75 percent were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

If the diagnosis cannot be made with certainty by CT or MRI, we obtain needle-guided biopsy.</p><p>The critical diagnostic features for all imaging modalities rely on the presence of fat in the AML lesion, and the diagnostic accuracy depends upon the amount of fat tissue in the tumor.

Epithelioid AMLs are often fat poor.</p><p>For minimal fat or fat-poor lesions, image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy should be performed since the diagnosis cannot be made with certainty by imagining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, if the lesion is highly suspicious for malignancy because of intratumoral necrosis or calcifications, many clinicians would elect to surgically remove the lesion rather than perform diagnostic biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2559353088\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnoses of AML include other renal masses detected by imaging, including renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma and metastatic lesions from primary tumors elsewhere.

In a study of 60 adults with renal AMLs, 14 of whom had TSC, patients with sporadic renal AMLs were older at presentation (mean 49 versus 26 years), had much smaller AMLs (mean size 4 versus 19 cm), and were much less likely to have multiple and bilateral AMLs (13 versus 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a much larger review of 336 patients (19 percent with TSC) who underwent surgery for renal AMLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The patients with sporadic renal AMLs were older (mean 52 versus 30 years), had smaller AMLs (mean 5.4 versus 8.9 cm), and were much less likely to have both multiple lesions (13 versus 97 percent) and acute hemorrhage (14 versus 44 percent).</p><p>A potential limitation to these observations is that the data come from urology centers and are therefore somewhat biased for inclusion of symptomatic patients with more progressive disease.</p><p>Among patients who undergo biopsy, histologic features may also help to distinguish sporadic from TSC-related AML. In a single-institution study of 194 renal AMLs in 185 patients, three histologic markers were observed more frequently in patients with TSC: epithelioid-variant AMLs, epithelial renal cysts, and microscopic AML foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Patients with multiple angiomyolipomas, particularly if they are large or bilateral, and patients who have undergone prior embolization or nephrectomy are not good candidates for embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Multiple large lesions often require extensive or repeat embolization, which is associated with a risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Similarly, surgical interventions for bilateral lesions markedly increase the risk of CKD.</p><p>mTOR inhibitors reduce tumor volume and decrease the risk of progression of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>].

The entry criteria were age &ge;18 years, a definite diagnosis of TSC or sporadic LAM, and at least one renal AML &ge;3 cm in its largest diameter. The primary endpoint of at least a 50 percent reduction in the total volume of all target AMLs identified at baseline was achieved in 42 percent of the patients treated with everolimus compared with none of the patients treated with placebo. The median time to response to everolimus was 2.9 months. Progression of AMLs was significantly more common in the placebo group (21 versus 4 percent). The median time to progression was 11.4 months with placebo and was not reached with everolimus.</p><p>We require evidence of growth (ie, &ge;5 mm per year) prior to committing to long-term treatment with mTOR inhibitors since many AMLs may stop growing or grow very slowly in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Caution should be used among patients who have reduced renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Such patients are at risk for further reductions in clearance, particularly if they also have proteinuria. If mTOR inhibitors are used for such patients, the eGFR should be rechecked within one month of starting treatment and every four months thereafter.</p><p>Benefits and risks of treatment with mTOR inhibitors should be discussed prior to initiation of treatment. Appropriate immunizations should be arranged (live vaccines cannot be given once treatment has started). Adverse events associated with the administration of mTOR inhibitors include stomatitis, diarrhea, aphthous ulcers, nasopharyngitis, acne-like lesions, hypercholesterolemia, hypophosphatemia, amenorrhea, noninfectious pneumonitis, and increased susceptibility to infections.

The presence of one or more large hypertrophic feeding vessels facilitates the procedure. Potential problems, which are not rare, include incomplete embolization, complications (postembolization syndrome, acute respiratory distress, and abscess formation), and recurrence of symptoms or AML growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/51-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-56</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of selective renal artery embolization was illustrated in a report of 30 patients (mean age 44 years) with large renal AMLs (mean diameter 8.2 cm), 18 of whom had TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-angiomyolipomas/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The embolization protocol combined three agents (pure alcohol for capillary occlusion, 500 to 700 micrometer microspheres for arteriole occlusion, and coils for proximal occlusion of the feeding pedicles). There were four technical failures. Among the AMLs that were embolized, embolization was complete after a single procedure in 83 percent. The mean reduction in AML volume was 43 percent at one to six months and 81 percent in the 12 AMLs followed for more than one year. The response was significantly <strong>smaller</strong> in fat-rich compared with fat-poor AMLs.</p><p>In addition to producing a persistent reduction in the size of large renal AMLs, selective renal artery embolization is also the preferred initial therapy in patients with acute life-threatening hemorrhage since it stabilizes the patient's condition and often eliminates the need for additional, more invasive therapy.

AMLs may be sporadic or associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) or sporadic pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Renal AMLs are uncommon in the general population, although the frequency of detection is increasing because of an increase in the use of imaging and advances in imaging technology. AMLs are much more common among patients with TSC or LAM. (See <a href=\"#H5623087\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3844029659\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of AMLs and disease associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two major histologic types of AML include classic and epithelioid variants. Most patients with sporadic AML have the classic type. Classic AMLs are benign but can be locally invasive, whereas the epithelioid variant occasionally undergoes malignant transformation as manifested by local recurrence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distal metastases. (See <a href=\"#H4146675064\" class=\"local\">'Classic variant'</a> above and <a href=\"#H537322799\" class=\"local\">'Epithelioid variant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AML is generally made by imaging, although a biopsy may be required to diagnose fat-poor lesions.
