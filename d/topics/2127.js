Blood in the urine can come from the kidney (where urine is made) or anywhere in the urinary tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65630 \">figure 1</a>). The urinary tract includes the ureters (the tubes from the kidneys to the bladder), the bladder (where urine is stored), and the urethra (the tube from the bladder to the outside of the body).</p><p>Although seeing blood in the urine can be very frightening, most of the time hematuria in children is not life threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF HEMATURIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main types of hematuria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gross hematuria &ndash; Gross hematuria means that blood can be seen in the urine with the naked eye because it turns the urine pink, red, or tea-colored. If you see blood in your child's urine, you should call your child's health care provider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic &ndash; Microscopic hematuria means that the urine is normal in color, but it has an increased number of red blood cells (blood) as seen with a microscope. Commonly, in office settings, urine specimens are screened for microscopic hematuria by urine dipstick (not by microscopy). If your child's urine dipstick shows blood in the urine, the urine should be examined with a microscope to confirm that blood is present. A positive finding on dipstick may not always be correct, so the presence or absence of blood needs to be confirmed by urine microscopic examination. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'What tests will be done?'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATURIA CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some common causes of blood in the urine include the following. However, many of these conditions will have other presenting symptoms (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms of conditions associated with hematuria'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney or bladder (also called urinary tract) infections. Infections that are localized only to the bladder are also referred to cystitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney stones</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritation of the urethra (the area where the urine exits the body)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma (for example, after falling off a bike and bruising a kidney)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vigorous exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney diseases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sickle cell disease or trait</p><p/><p>Less common causes of blood in the urine include inherited kidney diseases and other underlying medical problems. Cancers of kidney or urinary tract that cause hematuria in adults are very rare in children.</p><p>Sometimes, the urine appears to have blood in it because other red substances are contained in the urine. This can be seen when children eat an excessive amount of beets (called beeturia), food dyes, or with certain medications (such as <span class=\"nowrap\">phenazopyridine/Pyridium)</span>. Even highly concentrated urine may sometimes be confused with cola-colored urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS OF CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HEMATURIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematuria may not cause any symptoms. This section will describe the symptoms of some of the most common reasons for hematuria.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bladder infections &ndash; Infants with bladder infections may have fever, be irritable, and feed poorly. Older children may have fever, pain and burning while urinating, urgency, and lower belly pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kidney infections &ndash; Children with kidney infections may have fever, chills, and flank pain (pain in one side of the back).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney stones &ndash; Children with kidney stones may have severe belly or flank pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney stones in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney diseases &ndash; Children with kidney diseases can have a variety of symptoms, such as weakness, high blood pressure, puffiness around the eyes, joint swelling, abdominal pain, pale skin, skin rashes, or seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the amount of bleeding, a clot may form in the bladder, which may cause obstruction to the flow of urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sickle cell anemia &ndash; Patients may have anemia, painful crisis, and other complications associated with sickle cell anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Sickle cell disease (The Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-trait-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Sickle cell trait (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT TESTS WILL BE DONE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a child with hematuria depends upon the type of hematuria (microscopic or gross) and the child's recent history, symptoms, and physical examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child has microscopic hematuria, but has no symptoms (pain, fever, recent trauma) and no protein in the urine, a urine test will be repeated several times over a few months to determine if the blood persists. No further testing is needed. Urine calcium may also be checked to see if there is an increased amount of calcium in the urine. If the microscopic hematuria does not resolve, and your child continues to have no symptoms and no protein in the urine, the child will be monitored over time. The child may be referred to a pediatric nephrologist (kidney specialist) if hematuria persists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child has hematuria and has symptoms of a bladder or kidney infection, testing will be done to confirm the diagnosis. This usually includes a urine culture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child has hematuria and symptoms suggestive of a kidney stone, testing with an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan of the kidney is performed to confirm the presence and location of a kidney stone. A urine sample will be collected over 24 hours to measure substances that cause kidney stones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child has had a recent injury, an imaging test may be recommended to examine the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child has hematuria and protein in the urine, further testing will be done. This includes blood and urine tests to evaluate the child's kidney function. The child's blood pressure will also be measured because high blood pressure is a common finding in children with kidney problems. The child may be referred to a pediatric nephrologist if the tests are abnormal.</p><p/><p>Family members of children with persistent hematuria may also be tested. Familial hematuria, which has no serious long-term effects, is the most common cause of persistent microscopic hematuria in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATURIA TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no specific treatment for hematuria. Rather, treatment is aimed at the underlying cause, if a cause can be determined. Treatment of specific causes of hematuria is discussed separately.
