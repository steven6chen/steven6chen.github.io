Acute toxicity develops during or shortly after the completion of treatment and is usually temporary. Late toxicity presents months to years after the completion of treatment and is often permanent. The term &quot;complication&quot; is used for a treatment toxicity that causes an important medical problem.</p><p>This topic will review the care of patients with head and neck cancer during their initial therapy, both to treat acute toxicity and to prevent late complications. The management of late complications is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1057183973\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum of issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract are in close proximity to organs vital to a patient's quality of life (eg, tongue, larynx, mandible), and they often emanate from such organs. The involvement of these structures with cancer and the steps needed to eradicate the malignancy can cause a wide spectrum of toxicities.</p><p>The most basic toxicities are the impairment in the ability to breathe, communicate, and maintain an adequate oral intake. Oral intake is compromised by swallowing problems (dysphagia and odynophagia), poor taste (dysgeusia), trismus, xerostomia, and mucositis. Respiration and communication can be compromised by bulky tumors, neuromuscular impairment secondary to tumor growth, or an edematous pharynx <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larynx. In addition to toxicity limiting the ability to speak, eat, and breathe, patients can experience cutaneous toxicity from both radiation and targeted therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>), neurotoxicity from both commonly used chemotherapy agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>) and radiation, and dental complications from the effects of radiation dose to the <span class=\"nowrap\">mandible/maxilla</span> and salivary glands.</p><p>The treatment of these tumors is complex and best handled by a coordinated team involving surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, dentists, oral surgeons, speech pathologists, <span class=\"nowrap\">physical/occupational</span> therapists, nutritionists, and skilled nurses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most surgical complications are subsite specific. Common to any of the surgical procedures is the possibility of cosmetic deformities or functional impairment. With the development of soft tissue transfers, advances in surgical techniques, and organ preservation approaches, these are less common than they were in the past.</p><p>Nonetheless, major or even minor surgical defects in these areas may be very evident because of their location on the face and neck, resulting in emotional and psychological distress. (See <a href=\"#H1058318955\" class=\"local\">'Anxiety and depression'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most radiation therapy (RT) toxicity can be divided into acute toxicity, which is largely unavoidable but transient, and late toxicity, which can be minimized but is generally long lasting and in some instances permanent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute toxicity is defined as events that happen during RT or within 90 days after the commencement of treatment. While a sophisticated understanding of dose response relationships for normal tissues of interest (eg, parotid gland, larynx, pharyngeal constrictors) can reduce late toxicity, efforts to minimize acute toxicity have been less successful. The simplest and most important way to minimize acute toxicity is to avoid overtreatment (ie, not treat unnecessarily large target volumes).

All patients should receive counseling about the importance of smoking cessation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As an example, one study evaluated 115 patients with head and neck cancer who were treated with RT with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The 53 patients who continued to smoke during RT had significantly lower rates of complete response and two-year survival compared with the 62 patients who did not smoke or who had quit prior to treatment (45 versus 74 percent and 39 versus 66 percent, respectively). Among nonsmoking patients, mortality rate was influenced by the duration since quitting smoking. Compared with patients who continued to smoke, the death rate was 40 percent lower in patients who had quit less than 12 weeks before and 70 percent lower in patients who had quit more than one year before diagnosis.</p><p>Although the epidemiology of head and neck cancer is changing with the emergence of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal cancer, the importance of smoking cessation has not changed.

However, changes in the quantity and composition of saliva that occur shortly after the initiation of radiation therapy (RT) indicate that these glands exhibit both an acute response and a late response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The etiology of the acute reaction of salivary gland cells is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. These effects are due to irradiation of both the major (parotid, submandibular, sublingual) salivary glands and the minor salivary glands that are scattered throughout the upper aerodigestive tract. Impaired oral intake due to mucositis or altered sensation of taste may also contribute to decreased saliva production. Comorbid conditions and the medications used to treat them may contribute significantly to the risk of both acute and long-term xerostomia. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Mucositis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H722455196\" class=\"local\">'Dysgeusia'</a> below.)</p><p>Temporary decreased saliva production becomes evident within one to two weeks after the initiation of RT, and permanent reduction can be noted with cumulative radiation doses as low as 10 to 15 Gy to the parotid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. During and immediately after treatment, patients should be instructed to drink adequate fluids and to rinse and gargle with either a dilute solution of 25 percent hydrogen peroxide and 75 percent water or a weak solution of salt and baking soda several times daily (one-half teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of baking soda added to one quart of water) during treatment. This regimen can refresh the mouth, loosen thick, tenacious oral secretions, and alleviate pain due to mild mucositis.</p><p>Mean radiation doses to the parotid glands greater than 24 to 26 Gy cause permanent damage to the parotid glands, which typically results in more than a 75 percent reduction in salivary gland function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The radiation dose response of the submandibular gland and minor salivary glands of the oral cavity is less well defined than that of the parotid, but avoidance of these organs in a way that does not compromise target coverage and oncologic outcome is advised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

An important benefit of highly conformal RT approaches such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is decreased irradiation of the salivary glands and, therefore, less long-term damage.

Amifostine is the only pharmacologic agent with established efficacy in the prevention of xerostomia. Its role in patient management is uncertain secondary to the concerns listed below. Currently, the routine use of amifostine in patients receiving modern combined modality chemoradiation is not justified.</p><p>The benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amifostine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amifostine</a> in the prevention of xerostomia was demonstrated in a trial of 315 patients with head and neck cancer who received definitive or adjuvant postoperative RT (60 to 70 Gy in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy daily fractions) without chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to intravenous amifostine (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day 30 minutes prior to each radiation dose) or no amifostine. Amifostine reduced the incidence of significant acute xerostomia from 78 to 51 percent, and the incidence of significant chronic xerostomia was found to be reduced at up to 24 months of follow-up. Although concerns have been raised that amifostine might impair the anti-tumor efficacy of treatment, a meta-analysis that included data from 1119 patients on 12 trials, 65 percent of whom had head and neck cancer, found that treatment with amifostine was not associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>It is important to recognize that the value of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amifostine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amifostine</a> in the contemporary management of patients with head and neck cancer is unclear:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amifostine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amifostine</a> is effective at diminishing xerostomia in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy is unclear.
