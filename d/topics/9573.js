This problem comes up with surprising frequency with respect to the knee and also occurs with joints that are more difficult to tap, such as ankle and shoulder. The proper approach to a dry tap in an individual patient has to take into account, above all, the degree of suspicion of a <strong>septic joint</strong>. When joint fluid is necessary for diagnosis, consideration should be given to the potential causes of a dry tap as well as to the need for advanced imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF A DRY TAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three major explanations for a dry tap after extraarticular placement of the needle tip is excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72363\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72363 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mistaken physical diagnosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blockage of the bevel of the needle by plica, fat, or debris</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very high viscosity fluid or true lipoma arborescens</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dry tap in the knee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative frequency of the different possible explanations of failed arthrocentesis remains conjectural. Ultrasonography (US) can often solve the practical problem of a dry tap if multiple unguided attempts fail. In addition, the advent of more sensitive imaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee, has permitted many of the explanations for failed arthrocentesis to be vividly illustrated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Probably the most common cause of failed arthrocentesis occurs when the examiner is mistaken and no joint effusion is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68585\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68585 \">image 1</a>). Even the experienced clinician can make this mistake, particularly in the obese patient. However, a similar problem can occur in patients of average weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many subjects have a triangular fat pad at the medial aspect of the patellofemoral compartment, which is the most common site to attempt arthrocentesis of the knee. Placing the needle in this location may yield no fluid if the fat pad is thick (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72085\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72085 \">image 2</a>). The medial fat pad is the strongest individual reason for a switch from the medial to the lateral approach for a knee tap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronically inflamed synovium may undergo fat replacement over a period of time and may become markedly thickened, much more so than is indicated by examination of the surface anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57209\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57209 \">image 3</a>). This condition, when severe, may be referred to as the pathologic entity of lipoma arborescens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-the-dry-tap/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A commonly invoked, but rarely present, explanation for failed arthrocentesis in the knee is a medial plica (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68856 \">picture 1</a>) which behaves as a dam or valve, obstructing the lumen of the needle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79326\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79326 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-the-dry-tap/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Anatomically, a medial patella plica is very common. Symptomatic inflammation of the plica is rare. &quot;Dry tap&quot; due to a medial plica is rare. Lateral plicae are very rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid can also become inaccessible by one or more routes when joints have only a low volume of fluid, or when the bevel becomes blocked by debris such as rice bodies or thick fibrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-the-dry-tap/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Highly viscous synovial fluid can be difficult or impossible to remove by smaller gauge needles, and increasing to a 20 or 18 gauge needle may be required. In some cases, the joint effusion consists of areas of free fluid along with other areas occupied by semisolid gelatinous material too viscous to be withdrawn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65066\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65066 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-the-dry-tap/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Failure to aspirate fluid from a popliteal (Baker's) cyst, for example, has sometimes been attributed to inspissation of joint fluid into a gelatinous mass which has fluid-like characteristics on physical examination but which is too viscous to be withdrawn even through a large gauge needle. Such inspissated &quot;pseudo-effusions&quot; are sometimes confirmed at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-the-dry-tap/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients have more than one cause for a dry tap, as with lipoma arborescens and a gelatinous effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51123\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51123 \">image 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dry tap in other joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other joints not as well-studied by MRI retain their complexity in the &quot;dry tap&quot; situation. In particular, the several normal anatomic compartments of the shoulder often require more than one attempt by different routes, US, or even arthroscopy.</p><p>A dry tap in a patient with apparent bilateral ankle effusions may be due to a <strong>periarthritis</strong> without true effusion. This can occur in sarcoidosis and gout. In the latter disorder, a single drop of interstitial fluid expressed from needle puncture wound of an unsuccessful arthrocentesis can be applied to a slide for examination under polarized light.</p><p>Unilateral ankle effusions can be crystal-induced &quot;cluster attacks&quot; in which several anatomically adjacent joints are involved. These latter attacks can sometimes be made to yield fluid by switching from the true ankle to the subtalar joint, one finger's breadth below the prominence of the lateral malleolus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66205\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66205 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH A DRY TAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a failed arthrocentesis, we generally proceed with some form of diagnostic imaging to confirm the presence of intraarticular fluid. Depending on the imaging modality, it can also be used to guide the joint aspiration.</p><p>We prefer ultrasonography (US), as this is an effective tool for both detecting a joint effusion and facilitating needle placement for arthrocentesis. However, the availability of this technique for use in the clinical setting varies widely due to potential costs of equipment, regulatory and reimbursement policies, and differences in experience and training between musculoskeletal clinicians. US can be used for direct guidance of needle insertion, with concurrent ultrasound visualization of the area for injection, or for indirect guidance, in which the target region is visualized for the purpose of marking the needle insertion site and of estimating the depth and direction of needle placement.</p><p>The use of ultrasound guidance in rheumatology practice continues to evolve and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-nomenclature-technical-considerations-validation-and-standardization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Nomenclature, technical considerations, validation, and standardization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Guided injection and aspiration of joints and related structures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other imaging modalities, including fluoroscopy, single energy computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can also sometimes be used to confirm the presence of a joint effusion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging techniques for evaluation of the painful joint&quot;</a>). Additional clinical considerations regarding specific joints are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee effusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four important teaching points for the approach to dry taps of knee effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-the-dry-tap/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unsuccessful aspiration from the medial side should be followed by a lateral approach. Many prefer to attempt aspiration from the medial side first because the surface landmarks and shape of the patella are more obvious medially.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A helpful maneuver in second attempts is to have a second operator compress the fluid from three sides of the knee. US should be performed if these two modalities are ineffective and if a septic joint is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination can occasionally be falsely positive, even when performed by experienced examiners; MRI is the gold standard when this is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With chronic effusions, it may be impossible to obtain fluid from either the medial or the lateral approach due to a gelatinous mass obstructing the needle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65066\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65066 \">image 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip effusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip effusions are seen well on ultrasound in adults, as demonstrated in a study promoting the bedside use of joint US in the rheumatologic setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-the-dry-tap/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In children, however, more mobile femoral heads are sometimes pushed anteriorly, obscuring the existence of hip effusion from the vantage point of the anteriorly placed ultrasound window. US is useful for average to thin adults and is considered by pediatric radiologists to be the imaging modality of choice (over fluoroscopy) for children suspected of hip joint effusion. The standard imaging study for the hip requiring arthrocentesis remains arthrocentesis under fluoroscopy for heavier patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Shoulder effusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other joints, US can be used to confirm a glenohumeral joint effusion and guide the aspiration. US of the shoulder and an approach to an ultrasound-guided aspiration of the glenohumeral joint is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-shoulder#H3358957\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Sonographic appearance of shoulder pathology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures#H18566079\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Guided injection and aspiration of joints and related structures&quot;, section on 'Shoulder joint and subacromial/subdeltoid bursa'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11369318\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A joint that appears to have an effusion on physical examination may occasionally yield a &quot;dry tap&quot; during diagnostic arthrocentesis, even after the needle has been redirected and is clearly in the joint space. Explanations for a dry tap that should be considered, after extraarticular placement of the needle tip is excluded, include mistaken physical diagnosis; blockage of the bevel of the needle by plica, fat, or debris; and very high viscosity fluid or true lipoma arborescens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72363\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72363 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Causes of a dry tap'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of failed arthrocentesis of the knee may be the absence of a joint effusion, despite an apparent effusion on examination; this may occur more frequently in obese patients. Other causes include insertion of the needle into the fat pad sometimes present at the medial aspect of the patellofemoral compartment, fatty replacement of chronically inflamed synovium (lipoma arborescens), a low volume of fluid, blockage by debris, and use of a needle of insufficient gauge for a gelatinous effusion. The presence of multiple anatomic compartments in a joint, such as the shoulder, or periarthritis and swelling without true arthritis, as sometimes occurs in the ankle, are also potential causes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dry tap in the knee'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Dry tap in other joints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced imaging, preferably ultrasonography (US), is often helpful in patients with a dry tap.
