The origin may be fetal, placental, or maternal, with significant overlap among these entities. </p><p>A major focus of prenatal care is to determine whether a fetus is at risk for growth restriction and to identify the growth restricted fetus. This is important because these fetuses are at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome. In addition, FGR appears to be an antecedent to some cases of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, and diabetes mellitus in the adult (Barker hypothesis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=possible-role-of-low-birth-weight-in-the-pathogenesis-of-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Possible role of low birth weight in the pathogenesis of primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prenatal screening for FGR in general obstetrical populations involves identifying risk factors for impaired fetal growth and physically assessing fetal size. Clinical suspicion based upon risk factors or physical examination is followed by a detailed sonographic assessment of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management#H10977009\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Determining the cause'</a>.)</p><p>The most common sonography-based definition of FGR is a weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, although other definitions employing a variety of criteria have been advocated. When a small fetus is detected, it can be difficult to distinguish between the fetus that is constitutionally small versus growth restricted. It is also difficult to identify the fetus that is not small but growth restricted relative to its genetic potential. Making the correct diagnosis is not always possible, but is important prognostically and for estimating the risk for recurrence. </p><p>Ideally, prenatal detection of FGR will provide an opportunity to employ interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this problem. Although stillbirth rates are higher when FGR is not detected antenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], there is only low quality evidence that antenatal identification of FGR improves outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Defining the population of growth restricted fetuses at high risk of adverse outcome, accurately identifying these fetuses in utero, and determining interventions to improve outcome remains a challenge. These issues need to be addressed by large multicenter studies employing consistent definitions, randomly assigned interventions, and with long-term follow-up.</p><p>The diagnosis of FGR will be reviewed here. The etiology, management, and prognosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common definition of FGR refers to a weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], although other definitions employing a variety of criteria have been advocated (eg, &lt;5th percentile, &lt;3rd percentile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This definition is problematic because it does not make a distinction among fetuses who are (1) constitutionally small, (2) small because a pathologic process has kept them from achieving their genetic growth potential, and (3) not small but a pathologic process has kept them from achieving their genetic growth potential. It also requires an appropriate reference standard. Whether this standard should be based on birth weights across gestation, ultrasound-estimated fetal weights across gestation, or a customized standard, is also controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The major criticism of the birth weight reference is that before term it is flawed because babies born preterm are often growth restricted. The ultrasound-based approach is limited by the inaccuracy and imprecision of ultrasound estimated fetal weight.</p><p>A small for gestational age (SGA) infant may be growth restricted or constitutionally small. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a>.) As many as 70 percent of fetuses who are estimated to weigh below the 10th percentile for gestational age are small simply due to constitutional factors such as female sex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75060 \">table 1</a>) or maternal ethnicity, parity, or body mass index; they are not at high risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There is a real possibility of misclassifying these normally nourished, healthy, but constitutionally small, fetuses as growth restricted. By comparison, a malnourished fetus whose estimated weight is slightly greater than the 10th percentile may be misclassified as appropriately grown and at low risk of adverse perinatal outcome, even though its weight may be far below its genetic potential.</p><p>Numerous approaches to differentiate the fetus or infant with growth restriction from the small, but otherwise healthy, baby have been proposed. Some criteria pertain to the fetus, others can only be employed in the neonate (eg, ponderal index, skin fold thickness, presence of nucleated red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL AND ABNORMAL FETAL GROWTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal fetal growth reflects the interaction of the fetus's genetically predetermined growth potential and its modulation by the health of the fetus, placenta and the mother. </p><p>Population-based intergenerational studies of birth weight have reported that genetic factors contribute 30 to 50 percent of the variation in birth weight, with the remainder due to environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Maternal genes influence birth weight more than paternal genes, but both have an effect. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of fetal growth comprises three consecutive and somewhat overlapping phases. The first phase is the phase of cellular hyperplasia and encompasses the first 16 weeks of gestation. The second phase, known as the phase of concomitant hyperplasia and hypertrophy, occurs between the 16th and 32nd weeks and involves increases in cell size and number. The third and final phase, called the phase of cellular hypertrophy, occurs between the 32nd week and term and is characterized by a rapid increase in cell size.</p><p>Quantitatively, normal singleton fetal growth increases from approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> at 14 to 15 weeks of gestation to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> at 20 weeks and 30 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> at 32 to 34 weeks, after which the growth rate decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The median growth rate in multiple gestations is lower than that of singletons during the third trimester (see topic reviews on twin and triplet pregnancy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symmetric and asymmetric growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern of normal growth described above forms the basis for the clinical classification of FGR:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetric FGR, which comprises 20 to 30 percent of growth restricted fetuses, refers to a growth pattern in which all fetal organs are decreased proportionally due to global impairment of early fetal cellular hyperplasia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetric FGR is characterized by a relatively greater decrease in abdominal size (eg, liver volume and subcutaneous fat tissue) than head circumference and is found in the remaining 70 to 80 percent of the FGR population. Asymmetric fetal growth is thought to result from the capacity of the fetus to adapt to a hostile environment by redistributing blood flow in favor of vital organs (eg, brain, heart, placenta) at the expense of nonvital fetal organs (eg, abdominal viscera, lungs, skin, kidneys) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical assessment is a reasonable screening tool for FGR in low risk pregnancies, as there is no high quality evidence that alternative approaches, such as routine ultrasound examination, improve outcome over clinical assessment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Clinical assessment is based on assessment of past and present risk factors, physical examination, and ultrasound studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management#H10977009\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Determining the cause'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Accurate assessment of gestational age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate knowledge of gestational age (GA) is critical to the diagnosis of FGR, given that normal and abnormal fetal size are defined, in part, by comparing the fetal weight of the index fetus to that of other fetuses of the same gestational age. A detailed discussion of determination of GA can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a subgroup of fetuses, growth delay can be identified as early as the first trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-outcome-of-first-trimester-growth-delay\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and outcome of first-trimester growth delay&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Symphysis-fundal height measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the distance between the upper edge of the pubic symphysis and the top of the uterine fundus using a tape measure is a simple, inexpensive, and widespread procedure performed during antenatal care to detect fetuses that are poorly grown. The first suspicion of FGR often arises when this length is noted to be discordant with the expected size for dates. Discordancy has been defined in various ways, the most common criteria is a fundal height in centimeters that is at least three centimeters below the GA in weeks (eg, fundal height 32 cm at 36 weeks of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The accuracy of fundal height measurements for screening for and diagnosis of FGR is controversial. A systematic review concluded evidence was inadequate (one randomized trial) to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique versus abdominal palpation for detecting abnormal fetal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Observational studies using symphysis-fundal height measurements have reported a wide range of sensitivities: 13 to 86 percent of small fetuses were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/18,20-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20-27</a>]. The method performs best when all of the measurements are done by the same clinician using the unmarked side of the tape (to reduce bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]) and are plotted to reflect fetal growth for the individual patient (&ldquo;customized&rdquo;), rather than against a standardized norm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Other factors which may affect sensitivity include maternal body mass index, bladder volume, parity, and ethnic group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/25,26,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,31,32</a>].</p><p>The INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup> Project International published printable <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/suppl/2016/11/07/bmj.i5662.DC1/papa034430.ww_default.pdf&amp;token=H1aCGMkibyxDg1fga6JImLKcE2WmjSZps/pv26Ims6vAgL/cp+OAOCwoI2W4oAA7dGTlHuB0vLaqVuhW3aMWCjNrLSgk73XcyjHkkODV74LXCR0MVNJPvAHRg8CSk34I&amp;TOPIC_ID=6752\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">symphysis-fundal height measurement standards</a> for the 3rd, 50th, and 97th centiles using the eight urban populations of healthy, well-nourished women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical assessment of fetal size by abdominal palpation does not perform well as a test for detecting FGR: sensitivities range from 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/22,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110090749\"><span class=\"h1\">SONOGRAPHIC SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool#H95143388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;, section on 'Better diagnosis of deficient growth and improvement in perinatal outcome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SONOGRAPHIC DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a general consensus that once the suspicion of FGR has arisen because of risk factors or physical examination, sonographic techniques should be used to try to confirm or exclude the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Clinical assessment alone is not adequate in pregnancies at high risk for FGR, given the low sensitivity and specificity. Risk factors that should prompt an ultrasound examination include significant lag of the fundal height on physical examination, suboptimal growth on a prior ultrasound, history of a prior birth of a small for gestational age infant, poor maternal weight gain, preeclampsia, or maternal conditions (eg, lupus erythematosus, hypertension) associated with suboptimal fetal growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of sonographic parameters have been used to diagnose FGR. The procedures for measuring these parameters can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound examination in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A major limitation in interpreting the predictive value of sonography for diagnosing FGR and comparing predictive values derived from different studies is that these values depend upon the prevalence of FGR in the population studied. Thus, ultrasound results need to be interpreted in terms of pretest risk of FGR and take into account whether the subject population was at low, moderate, or high risk of fetal growth abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>Sonographic estimation of fetal weight is the single best morphometric test to screen for and diagnose FGR (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Estimated fetal weight (EFW)'</a> below). Customized and individualized growth curves may improve diagnostic performance (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Customized growth curves'</a> below). The other morphometric tests discussed below are more likely to overlook fetuses with symmetric FGR, but can be used as confirmatory tests of suspected asymmetric FGR. As discussed above, symmetric FGR comprises 20 to 30 percent of growth restricted fetuses and asymmetric FGR occurs in the remaining 70 to 80 percent of the FGR population.</p><p>When ultrasound examination suggests a diagnosis of FGR, further evaluation to look for maternal, placental, or fetal disorders associated with impaired fetal growth is indicated. This evaluation helps to (1) distinguish the growth impaired fetus from the constitutionally small fetus, and (2) guide further management of the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management#H10977003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Confirm the diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal circumference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When fetal growth is compromised, the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) is smaller than expected because of depletion of abdominal adipose tissue and decreased hepatic size related to reduced glycogen storage in the liver. Although the size of the fetal liver may be reduced as a result of fetal malnutrition, this is a less sensitive marker for FGR than AC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Most studies report reduced AC is the most sensitive single morphometric indicator of FGR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-49</a>]. The performance of AC measurement was illustrated by a study of 3616 pregnancies over 25 weeks of gestation that had a single ultrasound examination performed within two weeks of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. AC measurement predicted small for gestational age (SGA) infants (ie, birth weight below the 10th percentile for GA) with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 61, 95, 86, and 83 percent, respectively. Measurement of AC was more predictive of FGR than measurement of either head circumference (HC) or biparietal diameter (BPD) or the combination of AC with either one of these two variables. The optimal time to screen for FGR was at approximately 34 weeks of gestation.</p><p>The following factors affect the sensitivity of the AC measurement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetric versus asymmetric growth abnormality. AC is more sensitive in asymmetric FGR. As an example, a study of 151 SGA infants reported the sensitivity of AC was 73 percent in the asymmetrical group, 59 percent in the symmetrical group, and 64 percent for the entire population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational age. AC is more sensitive later in gestation. As an example, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of AC measurement at 29 to 31 weeks for prediction of FGR were 41 and 51 percent, respectively; however, these values increased at term to 88 and 71 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time interval between AC measurements. AC is more sensitive when the interval between measurements is more than two weeks. This was illustrated by a study that showed that the false positive rates for inter-examination intervals of one, two, and four weeks were 31, 17, and 3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p>Small AC also correlates with parameters of morbidity associated with FGR. Biochemical markers of hypoxia and acidemia are more common when the AC is below the 5th percentile for GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimated fetal weight (EFW)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AC alone can be used for predicting weight in normally growing fetuses at term and in low-risk populations; however, this method has limitations when used in preterm or growth restricted fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/37,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,53,54</a>]. Therefore, additional sonographic variables have been incorporated into models for predicting fetal growth abnormalities. Fetal weight estimation has become one of the most common methods of identifying the growth restricted fetus since pediatricians use birth weight as their primary variable for defining growth restriction in the infant. Examples of fetal weight distribution by gestational age are provided in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56847 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75060 \">table 1</a>); several such tables exist and are slightly different depending on the population studied and methods used. The Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study developed an international growth and size standard by prospectively assessing fetal growth in over 4000 healthy, well-nourished women with well-dated pregnancies at low risk of fetal growth restriction who had no major pregnancy complications and delivered live nonanomalous singletons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Ultrasound examinations were obtained every five weeks from 14 weeks to 42 weeks of gestation and biometric measurements were used to derive the best fitting curves for the 3rd, 50th, and 97th centiles. Standards for newborn birthweight were also developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96940 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The World Health Organization has published charts for fetal growth and common ultrasound biometric measurements based on longitudinal data derived from 10 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In 1975, Campbell and Wilkin first published a regression equation for estimating fetal weight based upon sonographic measurement of the AC and HC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Other equations have been published subsequently using two or more morphometric body measurements (eg, BPD, AC, HC, occipital frontal diameter, abdominal diameter, transthoracic circumference, and femur length [FL]) to improve sonographic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. Equations that incorporate AC, BPD, and FL seem to provide the most accurate estimates of fetal weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>In one study, EFW assessments within one week of delivery were within 10 percent of the actual birth weight in 75 percent of patients in whom there was a clinical suspicion of FGR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of EFW for FGR &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile are approximately 90, 85, 80, and 90 percent, respectively, when performed proximate to delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. EFW performed within one to two weeks of delivery is more predictive than when performed earlier in gestation.</p><p>The sensitivity of EFW for predicting FGR and adverse outcome associated with FGR is highest for infants with severe growth restriction (birth weight &lt;3rd percentile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/64,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,68</a>]. In one study, all infants with birth weight &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile were identified prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In another study including 1116 consecutive fetuses with EFW &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile, all 8 mortalities occurred among the 826 fetuses with EFW &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. EFW &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile was the only sonographic weight-related definition consistently associated with adverse outcome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Customized growth curves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EFW is typically classified using population-based birth weight centiles; however, multiple variables affect fetal weight and can be incorporated into individualized or customized centiles. These variables include fetal gender and maternal parity, ethnicity, height, weight, and age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]; maternal characteristics have greater fetal effects than paternal characteristics. A potentially better approach is to utilize large population-based data sets that account for these variables and exclude the effects of pathologic variables such as maternal smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and preterm birth. Using these data, the optimal birth weight and range of normal around this weight for a specific fetus can be estimated at term and can be determined for each gestational age to create an ultrasound-based, customized, optimal growth curve. The actual EFW is then plotted on this optimized customized curve to create the individual fetus' growth curve across gestation.

These studies have generally concluded that using a customized birth weight standard improves the identification of fetuses at risk of perinatal death and neonatal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/73-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-81</a>], but this remains controversial. One large study found that neither the population-based nor the customized reference did well in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes, and was only useful at &le;5th centile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the small for gestational age fetus by population-based standards that is normal in size on a customized growth standard did not appear to be at risk of adverse outcome. Another large study concluded that birth weight &le;25th or &ge;85th centile was associated with greater risk of adverse outcomes, but customized growth curves did not identify more fetuses at risk of death than noncustomized growth curves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>This improvement in prediction of outcome may be related to better identification of the constitutionally small fetus through adjustment for maternal characteristics, or to use of an intrauterine (ultrasound) growth standard rather than a birth weight standard for classification of FGR. Since fetuses who are born preterm tend to have lower birth weights that fetuses of the same gestational age who remain in utero, using an intrauterine weight standard increases identification of FGR remote from term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The higher perinatal mortality among infants classified as FGR by the customized reference is largely due to the inclusion of more preterm births in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/78,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,84,85</a>].

Irrespective of GA, there is a significantly lower rate of change over time of AC or EFW in FGR fetuses compared with those fetuses whose growth is appropriate for GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

In addition, a significant proportion (approximately 15 to 80 percent) of fetuses with FGR do not have decreased amniotic fluid volume. Therefore, oligohydramnios is a poor screening modality for suboptimal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/47,88,104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,88,104,105</a>].

Continuous, adequate perfusion of the maternal and fetal sides of the placenta is necessary for normal fetal growth. FGR is associated with diminished flow and abnormal Doppler waveforms in both maternal and fetal vessels. Assessment of Doppler flow with appropriate intervention can reduce perinatal mortality in pregnancies complicated by FGR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].

The shape of the uterine artery velocity waveform is unique: it is characterized by high end-diastolic velocities with continuous forward blood flow throughout diastole. As GA advances, the degree of end-diastolic flow typically increases; however, failure of normal endovascular trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries results in increased uterine artery vascular resistance and decreased perfusion of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115</a>].

Diastolic blood flow may be absent or even reversed with extreme degrees of placental dysfunction.

As an example, a review of 27 uterine artery Doppler studies for the prediction of preeclampsia and associated complications (eg, FGR, perinatal death) included 12,994 pregnancies stratified into low or high risk for developing these problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. In low-risk women the pooled likelihood ratio for developing FGR was 3.6 (95% CI 3.2-4.0) for a positive test result and 0.8 (95% CI 0.8-0.9) for a negative test result. In the high-risk population, a positive test result predicted FGR with a pooled likelihood ratio of 2.7 (95% CI 2.1-3.4), whereas the likelihood ratio for a negative test was 0.7 (95% CI 0.6-0.9).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Umbilical artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler umbilical artery studies are not useful for screening and diagnosis of FGR.

One hundred sixty-eight women at high risk for FGR were evaluated for growth restriction with Doppler and gray-scale ultrasound; 42 delivered an SGA infant. Sensitivity of the <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> ratio of the umbilical artery was lower than for sonographic estimates of fetal weight (55 versus 76 percent); however, the Doppler had higher specificity (92 versus 80 percent) and higher positive predictive value (73 versus 58 percent). The two techniques used together further improved the positive predictive value for diagnosis of FGR to 77 percent, with a negative predictive value of 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p>Doppler has been useful in evaluation and management of pregnancies suspected of FGR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>]. Not all infants whose birth weight is below the 10th percentile have been exposed to a pathological process. Most small newborns are constitutionally small and healthy. Differentiating the fetus with pathological growth restriction who is at risk for perinatal complications from the constitutionally small, but healthy, fetus has been an ongoing challenge in obstetrics.

This part of the aorta provides perfusion to the fetal abdominal organs, umbilical-placental circulation, and lower limbs.

In the normally developing fetus, the brain is an area of low vascular impedance and is the recipient of continuous forward flow throughout the cardiac cycle. Asymmetric FGR is likely caused by redistribution of fetal blood flow to the fetal brain, at the expense of less essential areas such as subcutaneous tissue, kidneys, and liver. However, the already low cerebral resistance has to drop even further to enhance cerebral blood flow.

The error in birth weight prediction by three-dimensional ultrasound, Warsof's formula, Hadlock's formula, and Thurnau's formula were 0.7, 6.2, 6.7, and 20.8 percent respectively. In addition, three-dimensional ultrasound thigh volumetry was not influenced by oligohydramnios, fetal head engagement, or inaccurate abdominal circumference measurement. These results were confirmed in other studies that found three-dimensional thigh, femur, or humerus volume measurement was simple, and more accurate than two-dimensional ultrasound methods in the prediction of fetal weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/153-156\" class=\"abstract_t\">153-156</a>].</p><p>Three-dimensional ultrasound appears to be highly promising in the clinical setting of FGR because it appears to provide more precise information regarding structural abnormality, organ volumetry, EFW and oligohydramnios than standard two-dimensional techniques. However, this modality is not widely available and has not been adequately assessed in large or controlled studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach to fetal growth restriction (FGR) should integrate information from maternal history and physical examination with information from sonographic evaluation of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid. The combined information helps to both confirm the diagnosis and establish the etiology for the growth abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ultrasound diagnosis of FGR is based on discrepancies between actual and expected biometric measurements for a given gestational age. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Sonographic diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no high quality evidence that ultrasound screening for FGR in low risk pregnancies improves pregnancy outcome over clinical assessment alone. We suggest screening for FGR by identifying the presence of risk factors and performing serial measurements of fundal height to identify discordancy between fundal height and gestational age (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Clinical suspicion of FGR should be followed with detailed sonographic assessment to make or exclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major limitation in interpreting the predictive value of sonography for diagnosing FGR and comparing predictive values derived from different studies is that these values depend upon the prevalence of FGR in the population studied. Thus, ultrasound results need to be interpreted in terms of pretest risk of FGR and take into account whether the subject population was at low, moderate, or high risk of fetal growth abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Sonographic diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetal AC is the most sensitive single morphometric measurement for diagnosis of FGR. However, it is not as predictive of FGR as sonographic estimation of fetal weight. <strong>Sonographic estimation of fetal weight is the best method for identifying fetuses whose birth weight is likely to be below the 10</strong><strong><sup>th</sup></strong><strong> percentile for gestational age</strong>. Estimated fetal weight &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile is consistently associated with adverse outcome. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal circumference'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Estimated fetal weight (EFW)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">HC/AC</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">FL/AC</span> ratios are particularly useful in the diagnosis of asymmetric fetal growth. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'HC/AC ratio'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'FL/AC ratio'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios corroborates the diagnosis of FGR by identifying one of the major consequences of the disorder. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Amniotic fluid volume'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of an estimated fetal weight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry is highly predictive of FGR and is the best tool available for identifying the growth restricted fetus at risk of adverse outcome. These pregnancies require more intensive monitoring. Venous Doppler assessment is used for monitoring fetal well-being, but has no role in diagnosis of FGR since venous Doppler abnormalities constitute a late circulatory finding. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Doppler velocimetry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is anticipated that three-dimensional volumetric fetal measurements will improve the accuracy of sonographic estimates of fetal weight, and thus our ability to identify the small fetus. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Three-dimensional ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gardosi J, Madurasinghe V, Williams M, et al.
