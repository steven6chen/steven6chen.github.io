However, the term &ldquo;Mikulicz syndrome&rdquo; should no longer be used in this way because it encompasses a variety of pathologic entities. The term originated following the 1892 description by Johann von Mikulicz-Radecki of a farmer with bilateral enlargement of the lacrimal and major and minor salivary glands and a uniform lymphocytic infiltrate of the salivary glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Multiple etiologies have been described for this clinicopathologic entity, including SS, sarcoidosis, infections, hematologic malignancies, and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. According to a 2005 review of Mikulicz&rsquo;s original paper, the index patient most likely had a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the salivary and lacrimal glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

IgG4-RD is characterized by raised serum levels of IgG4 and by tissue infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells with fibrosis or sclerosis. Despite marked lacrimal and salivary gland enlargement (IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis) in patients with this form of IgG4-RD, the patients experience relatively mild ophthalmologic and oral sicca complaints.

Only a small minority (about 10 percent) of patients with well-documented dry eyes have SS. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An annual incidence of SS of approximately 4 per 100,000 people was found in a population-based study from Olmsted County, Minnesota that used the 1993 European criteria for SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The highest incidence rates were reported in studies from Europe and Asia.

Reported prevalence rates in other population-based studies have varied from 0.01 to 0.09 percent, related in part to case ascertainment differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SS was identified, based upon the American&ndash;European Consensus Group criteria, in 11.6 percent of 327 patients in a prospective cohort with clinically significant aqueous-deficient dry eye who were drawn from a variety of eye care practices, including 6.4 and 5.2 percent with primary and secondary SS, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

A similar frequency of autoantibodies was found in each country, and the autoantibodies were directed against the same epitopes, despite the fact that each ethnic group had a different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II marker as a risk factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19529178\"><span class=\"h2\">Dry eye and mouth in older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sicca symptoms are much more common than SS, with a higher prevalence in older adults, about 30 percent of whom have symptoms of dry eyes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dry mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Sicca symptoms in older adults are due partly to medications and partly to age-related atrophy of secreting tissue and resultant declines in tear and basal (unstimulated) whole saliva flow rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>In a study of 62 nursing home residents, 23 percent had objective evidence of dry eye disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The diagnosis can be made in individuals with an objective finding of ocular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral dryness for whom there is substantive evidence of an underlying autoimmune basis for the exocrine glandular dysfunction. There is no single diagnostic test for SS; thus, the clinical diagnosis of SS is made in the presence of compatible clinical and laboratory features and after the exclusion of other causes of ocular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral dryness (see <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). SS should not be diagnosed based solely upon the presence of antibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">SSA/Ro</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">SSB/La,</span> as these antibodies can be found not only in patients with SS, but in other <span class=\"nowrap\">rheumatic/connective</span> diseases, as well as in normal individuals.</p><p>We make a diagnosis of SS if the following two criteria are met and other causes of ocular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral dryness have been excluded (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has an objective marker of dry eye (Schirmer test in either eye of &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/5</span> min or abnormal ocular surface staining) (see <a href=\"#H19530955\" class=\"local\">'Schirmer test'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19530994\" class=\"local\">'Ocular surface staining'</a> below) or salivary hypofunction (abnormal Saxon test or whole sialometry) (see <a href=\"#H19531380\" class=\"local\">'Quantifying salivary hypofunction'</a> below). Alternatively, the patient may have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound (US) evidence of significant glandular parenchymal abnormalities characteristic of SS.

Alternatively, the patient may have anticentromere antibodies (in the absence of systemic sclerosis) or the combination of an antinuclear antibody (ANA) &ge;1:320 with a positive rheumatoid factor. The term &ldquo;secondary SS&rdquo; may be applied to those patients in whom the lacrimal and salivary gland dysfunction is occurring in the setting of a well-established systemic rheumatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We are cautious in accepting weakly positive tests for <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> as supportive of a diagnosis of SS.

This histologic pattern is known as focal lymphocytic sialadenitis.

Biopsies with only these changes are classified as nonspecific chronic sialadenitis or sclerosing chronic sialadenitis, depending on severity. Biopsies showing focal lymphocytic sialadenitis may also show some or all of these pathologic features, and it is thought that these relate to the independent effects of aging rather than immune-mediated inflammation.</p><p>The most widely accepted grading system for focal lymphocytic sialadenitis records the number of foci of lymphoid tissue in the tissue section, normalized to a surface area of 4 mm<sup>2</sup> (focus score). Each focus is defined as a collection of 50 or more mononuclear lymphoid cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages) that is adjacent to normal-appearing mucous acini and not in an area of glandular fibrosis or ductal dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].

Determination of the focus score in a labial gland biopsy showing focal lymphocytic sialadenitis requires three steps. First, the surface area of the glandular tissue is measured in a single tissue section containing multiple glands sectioned through their mid-portion. This requires a calibrated reticule or computer-assisted image analysis. Second, the number of lymphocytic foci in the entire tissue section is counted. Care is taken to only count foci with 50 or more tightly aggregated lymphocytes that are adjacent to normal-appearing mucous acini. Third, the number of foci is divided by the total glandular surface area of the section, and then multiplied by 4 to yield the focus score (number of <span class=\"nowrap\">foci/4</span> mm<sup>2</sup>).
