Part of the explanation for this phenomenon is the fact that meningitis due to <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> tends to strike young, previously well individuals and can progress over a matter of hours to death.</p><p>Mortality can be very high if the infection is not treated appropriately, and long-term sequelae can be severe even in successfully managed cases. The mortality and morbidity from meningococcal disease has changed very little since the 1950s, principally due to the inability to effectively manage the endotoxin-induced vascular collapse frequently caused by this organism.</p><p><em>N. meningitidis</em> can cause both endemic and epidemic infection. Large numbers of individuals can become infected in a population within a short space of time. With the reduction in cases of meningitis due to <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>N. meningitidis</em> has now become the second leading cause of meningitis in the United States. The majority of cases of meningococcal infection occur in young children and teenagers.</p><p>This pathogen has the added capacity to cause epidemics in which all age groups in the entire population become at risk. While the worst of these epidemics have recently been largely confined to less well-developed areas of the world, epidemics have occurred in areas of Europe and North America where there are very high standards of living. Epidemic meningococcal infection can be a terrifying experience for the population affected. The progression of disease can be very rapid. The clinical features can be quite dramatic with profound shock, subcutaneous and gingival hemorrhage, thrombosis of vessels to extremities, delirium, and coma leading to death within 24 hours.</p><p>The epidemiology of infections due to <em>N. meningitidis</em> will be reviewed here. The microbiology, pathobiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathobiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathobiology of Neisseria meningitidis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of meningococcal infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-meningococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of meningococcal infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of meningococcal infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningococcal-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meningococcal vaccines&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ATTACK RATES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The annual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in the United States varies in multiyear cycles; the most recent peak occurred during the mid-1990s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77474 \">figure 1</a>); subsequently, the incidence has declined annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Even before routine use of a meningococcal conjugate vaccine was recommended for adolescents beginning in 2005, the annual incidence of meningococcal disease had decreased between 1996 and 2005 from 1.1 to 0.4 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Between 2005 and 2011, the incidence of meningococcal disease in the United States was 0.3 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence of meningococcal disease peaks among three age groups: infants and children &lt;5 years of age, adolescents and young adults aged 16 through 21 years, and adults aged &ge;65 years.</p><p>Disease rates are almost 10 times higher in children below two years of age than in the overall population. The higher disease burden in children less than two years of age is illustrated by a multicenter surveillance study of invasive meningococcal infection in children that identified 159 cases between January 2001 and March 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Twenty-six percent of cases occurred in children less than 12 months of age and 14 percent in children 12 to 24 months of age.</p><p>Despite reports of outbreaks of cases on college campuses, a retrospective cohort study did not reveal an increase in the incidence of meningococcal infection in college students compared with age-matched controls (1.74 versus 1.44 per 100,000 population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, among affected college students, the rates of illness were higher for those residing on campus.</p><p>Meningococcal infection displays seasonal variation in attack rates, which are highest in February and March and lowest in September. There is no predisposition by sex. The predominant serogroups causing infection in the United States are serogroups B, C, and Y, each accounting for approximately one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The proportion of cases caused by each serogroup varies by age. Serogroups C, Y, and W135 cause 73 percent of cases among individuals &ge;11 years of age. In contrast, approximately 60 percent of disease among children aged 0 to 59 months is caused by serogroup B.</p><p>Serogroups B, C, and Y have remained the most common serogroups following introduction of MenACWY in 2006; however, there has been an increase in the proportion of serogroup Y and decrease in the proportion of serogroup B from 2000 to 2005 and 2006 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Capsule switching occurred in both periods.</p><p>The case-fatality rate in the United States has been estimated to be between 10 and 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, surveillance of invasive meningococcal infection in Maryland from 1990 through 1999 found that the case-fatality rate was considerably higher in patients aged 15 through 24 years, who accounted for 24 percent of the cases; the odds ratio of death in this age group was 6.1 compared with those under the age of 15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The highest case-fatality rate (24 percent) has been reported in adults &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3345873843\"><span class=\"h3\">Serogroup C in men who have sex with men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clusters of serogroup C meningococcal disease among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In 2012, an outbreak of invasive serogroup C meningococcal disease was detected among MSM in New York City [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The incidence rate of invasive meningococcal disease among MSM aged 18 to 64 years in New York City in 2012 was 12.6 per 100,000 persons (compared with 0.16 per 100,000 persons among non-MSM males of the same age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Between 2010 and March 2013, 22 cases were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The mean age was 34 years; 50 percent occurred in African Americans, 55 percent occurred in HIV-infected individuals, and 32 percent were fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Four additional cases were detected in MSM in New York City in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In Los Angeles, four cases of invasive meningococcal disease were reported in MSM between December 2012 and June 2013, and four additional cases were reported in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. In 2016, 25 outbreak-associated cases were reported in Southern California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p>Serogroup C meningococcus disease has also been reported among MSM in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Meningococcal vaccine recommendations for individuals at risk are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningococcal-vaccines#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meningococcal vaccines&quot;, section on 'Age &lt;11 or age &gt;18 years'</a>.)</p><p>The association between HIV infection and invasive meningococcal disease is discussed below.

These epidemics are most commonly caused by <em>N. meningitidis</em> serogroup A and occasionally by serogroup C.</p><p>Epidemics of meningococcal infection occur at irregular intervals, often every 7 to 10 years in the so-called &quot;meningitis belt&quot; of sub-Saharan Africa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63287\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63287 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The case rate during these epidemics can be as high as 1 in 1000 total population and 1 in 100 for children under two years of age. The largest outbreak of <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> serogroup C in Africa's meningitis belt occurred in 2015; 8500 suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis and 573 deaths were reported to the WHO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed a surveillance strategy to predict epidemics early and initiate vaccination drives. A study from Mali showed that detection of 5 cases per 100,000 population in one week was an appropriate threshold for alerting officials that vaccination might be required and 10 cases per 100,000 in one week confirmed regional epidemic activity with few false-positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These numbers were in contrast to the WHO recommended threshold of 15 cases per 100,000 averaged over two weeks.</p><p>In one epidemic in Nairobi, Kenya, which is outside of the meningitis belt, the attack rate was 2.5 cases per 10,000 population, with a case-fatality rate of approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Areas that included Nairobi's largest slums were particularly affected. This epidemic displayed an unusual age distribution, with high attack rates among 20- to 29-year-olds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3269948574\"><span class=\"h3\">Serogroup C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The largest <em>N. meningitidis</em> serogroup C epidemic ever reported occurred in Nigeria in 2016 to 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There were more than 14,000 suspected cases (fever &gt;100.4&deg;F plus one or more meningeal signs). Among the 1339 individuals who underwent laboratory testing, 32 percent were positive for bacterial pathogens, of which 83 percent had <em>N. meningitidis</em> serogroup C. This finding prompted vaccination of two million individuals between ages 2 and 29 years, which was effective in truncating the epidemic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2578471220\"><span class=\"h3\">Serogroup W135</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>W135 represents one of the less common serogroups of meningococci. The largest outbreak of infection due to this strain occurred among more than 400 pilgrims returning in 2000 and 2001 from the Hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Cases were detected in several countries in Asia, Europe, and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Three cases surfaced in the United States, one in a returning pilgrim and two in contacts of pilgrims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Serogroup W135 may also play a role in endemic infection. This was illustrated in a national surveillance study in South Africa in which the emergence of endemic serogroup W135 was associated with an increase in the incidence and severity of invasive meningococcal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. From 2000 through 2005, 2135 cases of invasive meningococcal disease were reported, 52 percent of which occurred in a single province. In this region, rates of disease increased from 0.8 cases per 100,000 persons in 2000 to 4.0 cases per 100,000 in 2005, and the proportion of cases due to serogroup W135 increased from 7 percent in 2000 to 75 percent in 2005. Overall case-fatality rates doubled from 11 percent in 2003 to 22 percent in 2005. Serogroup W135 was more likely to cause meningococcemia than serogroup A.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3426283849\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR VACCINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for meningococcal vaccination in selected individuals is discussed below. Issues related to meningococcal vaccination are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningococcal-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meningococcal vaccines&quot;</a>.)</p><p><em>N. meningitidis</em> can cause both endemic and epidemic infection. Meningococcal infections are endemic in the United States, and the annual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease varies in multiyear cycles; the most recent peak in incidence occurred during the mid-1990s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77474 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Between 2005 and 2011, the incidence of meningococcal disease in the United States was 0.3 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Disease rates are almost 10 times higher in children below two years of age than in the overall population. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'United States'</a> above.)</p><p>Outbreaks of meningococcal infection on college campuses have attracted considerable attention. A retrospective cohort study did not reveal an increase in the incidence of meningococcal infection in college students compared with age-matched controls (1.74 versus 1.44 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, among affected college students, the rates of illness were higher for those residing on campus. Another case-control study performed in college students determined that the incidence of infection was lower than the general population of 18- to 23-year-old nonstudents (0.7 versus 1.4 per 100,000); however, the incidence was highest in freshmen living in dormitories (5.1 per 100,000), and the risk for disease by multivariate analysis was 3.6 for this group compared with other college students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A study from the United Kingdom also found that having a high proportion of first-year students in a residence hall increased the risk for meningococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Large-scale epidemics occur with considerable frequency in the so-called &quot;meningitis belt,&quot; which crosses the waist of sub-Saharan Africa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63287\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63287 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The case rate during these epidemics can be as high as 1 in 1000 total population and 1 in 100 for children below two years of age. Travelers may be at risk for acquiring meningococcal infection, especially when traveling to regions at risk for epidemics or hyperendemic for the disease and for those with extensive contact with local residents. The Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca has been associated with outbreaks of meningococcal infection; pilgrims are required by the government of Saudi Arabia to be vaccinated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-travel#H1651582\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for travel&quot;, section on 'Meningococcal vaccine'</a>.)</p><p>Outbreaks of invasive serogroup C meningococcal disease have been reported in men who have sex with men (MSM). This is discussed further separately. </p><p>The distribution of serogroups of <em>N. meningitidis</em> causing infection can differ depending upon the region of the world. In a large United States survey, serogroups C, B, and Y accounted for 35, 32, and 26 percent of isolates, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of invasive infections in England and Wales are caused by serogroups B and C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Epidemics in Africa and elsewhere in the world are most frequently due to serogroup A and occasionally serogroup C. W135 is an uncommon serogroup but was responsible for a large number of cases among pilgrims returning from the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3536054784\" class=\"local\">'Genetics of outbreak strains'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR EPIDEMICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reason for the epidemic spread of the meningococcus is not known. The organism is considered a respiratory pathogen and spread is most likely by the aerosol route. It is clear that the high attack rates seen in the less well-developed countries are in part due to poverty and the consequences of crowding, poor sanitation, and malnutrition.</p><p>Factors such as herd immunity and specific virulence properties associated with epidemic strains have been implicated as factors in the rapid spread of infection in these situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Clonal analysis of strains from one epidemic in central and east Africa indicated that the epidemic strain had arisen in central Asia almost seven years prior; spread occurred through Northern India and Pakistan to Saudi Arabia and then to Africa via pilgrims from Mecca [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A number of American pilgrims returning from Mecca at that time were found to have nasopharyngeal colonization with this epidemic strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR ACQUISITION OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of environmental and host factors have been associated with an increased risk for endemic acquisition of <em>N. meningitidis</em> infection. The major associated factor is nasopharyngeal carriage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasopharyngeal carrier state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of nasopharyngeal carriage of the meningococcus in the transmission of the organism and the development of disease was appreciated early based upon the experience with military recruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Epidemic infections in American military recruit camps were a major problem prior to the introduction of vaccination. Throughout the nineteenth century, the unique susceptibility of military recruits can be attested by the clinical descriptions of this infection that can be found in the records of the Crimean and American Civil Wars. Since the introduction of vaccination of all recruits in the United States in 1972 with a tetravalent vaccine containing serogroup A, C, Y, and W135 polysaccharides, epidemics have not occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>However, vaccination of recruits is not universal around the world. The dynamics of carriage was studied in a 1998 report of military recruits in Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The rate of carriage in 1069 recruits followed for three months during each of three separate seasons was 39 to 47 percent at entry and did not change appreciably with time or season. Both loss of carriage and acquisition was documented in individuals, with 34 percent experiencing one or more change in carrier status over time. No differences were observed in the acquisition of invasive strains, which had caused disease in other subjects, from other strains in this study.</p><p>Another study examined the immune response in military recruits carrying the meningococcus or acquiring the organism in the pharynx during basic training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Increases in antibody to the colonizing strains were documented; individuals colonized with more than one strain made antibody responses only to the newly acquired strain. Serum bactericidal activity to the homologous strains was also demonstrated.</p><p>Intimate contacts of cases, including family members, college roommates, and nursery school classmates, are at 100- to 1000-fold increased risk of acquiring meningococcal infection. In one study of contacts of patients with meningococcal infection from Norway, household and kissing contacts had an increased frequency of carriage of the pathogenic strain compared with less close contacts (12.4 versus 1.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Part of the explanation for this phenomenon is the fact that meningitis due to <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> tends to strike young, previously well individuals and can progress over a matter of hours to death. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningococcal infections are endemic in the United States, and the annual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease varies from 0.5 to 1.5 cases per 100,000 population in multiyear cycles. The most recent peak in incidence occurred during the mid-1990s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77474 \">figure 1</a>). Disease rates are almost 10 times higher in children below two years of age than in the overall population. The predominant serogroups causing infection in the United States currently are serogroups B, C, and Y. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'United States'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large scale epidemics still occur with frequency in Africa, parts of Asia, South America, and the countries of the former Soviet Union. These epidemics are most commonly caused by <em>N. meningitidis</em> serogroup A and occasionally by serogroup C. (See <a href=\"#H3590175028\" class=\"local\">'Outside the United States'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemics of meningococcal infection occur at irregular intervals, often every 7 to 10 years in the so-called &quot;meningitis belt&quot; of sub-Saharan Africa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63287\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63287 \">figure 2</a>). The case rate during these epidemics can be as high as 1 in 1000 total population and 1 in 100 for children under two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H3590175028\" class=\"local\">'Outside the United States'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reason for the epidemic spread of the meningococcus is not known. The organism is considered a respiratory pathogen and spread is most likely by the aerosol route. It is clear that the high attack rates seen in the less well-developed countries are in part due to poverty and the consequences of crowding, poor sanitation, and malnutrition. Factors such as herd immunity and specific virulence properties associated with epidemic strains have been implicated as factors in the rapid spread of infection in these situations. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for epidemics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of environmental and host factors have been associated with an increased risk for endemic acquisition of <em>N. meningitidis</em> infection.
