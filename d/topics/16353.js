Once the concerns are identified, the provider can establish a plan for targeted education to address them. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Why parents refuse vaccines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Target education'</a> below.)</p><p>Some concerns may not be immediately obvious. Parents who are concerned that their infant may suffer during vaccine administration may fear <strong>committing</strong> harm (eg, giving an unsafe vaccine) more than <strong>permitting</strong> harm (eg, taking a chance that their child will develop a disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-childhood-vaccines-parental-hesitancy-or-refusal/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Providers must listen carefully and respectfully to understand these concerns, even if it is time consuming.</p><p>Respectful listening is also critical to identifying the source of parental concerns. Parents may receive vaccine information from mainstream media or the internet. The mainstream media has a limited ability to adequately communicate scientific information about vaccines, and internet sites are not subject to constraints regarding scientific accuracy or fairness of their reporting.</p><p>Mainstream media reports are designed to gain attention, present information that is easy to understand, and highlight pro- and antivaccine viewpoints in a limited span of time. They may give equal or greater weight to ill-informed opinions or anecdotal claims about the dangers of vaccines than to the rigorous scientific studies that prove vaccines are safe and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-childhood-vaccines-parental-hesitancy-or-refusal/abstract/46,55,63,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,55,63,115</a>]. Erroneous impressions from the media (including social media) may be reinforced by stories from family members, friends, or the internet.
