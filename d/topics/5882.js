Egg allergies are immunologic responses to proteins in foods and include immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody-mediated allergy as well as other allergic syndromes such as atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Management of egg allergy is discussed separately. General discussions of food allergy are presented separately in appropriate topic reviews. The options for administration of the influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy are also discussed separately.

A subsequent meta-analysis of the prevalence of food allergy estimated that egg allergy affects 0.5 to 2.5 percent of young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There were several limitations to the meta-analysis. There was significant variability in study design that made direct comparisons difficult. The majority of studies included in the meta-analysis were based upon self-reports of food allergy, which tend to overestimate the prevalence. Some studies used skin prick test and food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels to confirm sensitization to the allergen. However, not all sensitized patients have clinical allergy, and only three studies used double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs), the gold standard, to confirm the diagnosis of food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In these three studies of unselected populations, the prevalence of egg allergy ranged from 0.0004 percent in a cohort of German children aged 0 to 17 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], to 0.6 percent in nursery school children in Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], to 1.6 percent in three-year-old Danish children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. New-onset egg allergy in adults is rare and is limited to case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five major allergenic proteins from the egg of the domestic chicken (<em>Gallus domesticus</em>) have been identified that are responsible for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions; these are designated Gal d 1-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most of the allergenic egg proteins are found in egg white, including ovomucoid (Gal d 1), ovalbumin (Gal d 2), ovotransferrin (Gal d 3), lysozyme (Gal d 4), and ovomucin. Ovomucoid is the dominant allergen in egg (ie, is the allergen to which the most patients are sensitized), although ovalbumin is the most abundant protein comprising hen's egg white. Two additional proteins, lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase and egg white cystatin, that have IgE reactivity in individuals with egg allergy have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Chicken serum albumin, or alpha-livetin (Gal d 5), is the major allergen in egg yolk and is involved in the bird-egg syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-features-of-food-allergens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular features of food allergens&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergens: Overview of clinical features and cross-reactivity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Egg-specific IgE molecules that identify sequential or conformational epitopes can distinguish different clinical phenotypes of egg allergy. Sequential epitopes are determined by contiguous amino acids, whereas conformational epitopes contain amino acids from different regions of the protein that are in close proximity due to the folding of the protein. Conformational epitopes can be destroyed by heating or partial hydrolysis, which alter the tertiary structure of the protein.</p><p>Studies have found that the majority of egg-allergic individuals can tolerate extensively heated or baked egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Heating denatures proteins, thus eliminating conformational epitopes. In addition, results from a murine study suggest that heating may reduce allergenicity of ovalbumin and ovomucoid by altering digestion and absorption of these proteins in the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Ovalbumin epitopes are heat labile, but ovomucoid epitopes are not altered by extensive heating, suggesting that children who have specific IgE primarily to ovalbumin are likely to tolerate heated forms of egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-features-of-food-allergens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular features of food allergens&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Breakdown of proteins by gastric enzymes and the low pH of the stomach can alter the allergenicity of food proteins. Gastric digestion has been demonstrated to reduce the allergenicity of ovomucoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], which can explain why some patients have skin contact reactions to egg but not ingestion reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of non-IgE-mediated egg allergy is less clear. Egg allergy has been implicated as a trigger for atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Egg is also a common trigger for food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). Enteropathy induced by egg is rare. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mixed and non-IgE-mediated reactions'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated allergic reactions are the most common type of allergic reactions to egg. IgE-mediated reactions are rapid in onset (usually within minutes to two hours after ingestion), and symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, respiratory symptoms, and laryngeal edema are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 1</a>). The severity of symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. The clinical features of IgE-mediated reactions are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children can demonstrate symptoms of egg allergy starting in infancy, with most suffering from cutaneous symptoms. The development of sensitization in these patients is postulated to occur in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] or via exposure to maternal breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. For some children, the first known direct ingestion of egg can result in an allergic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], supporting the idea that sensitization can occur early through the mother. Mouse models suggest that sensitization may also occur via epicutaneous exposure (prior to gut mucosa exposure) and may play a role in the development of atopic dermatitis and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Although cutaneous symptoms are most common, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms are reported as well. The severity of reactions can be unpredictable and vary from episode to episode. Egg allergy is potentially life threatening. Anaphylaxis can occur with exposure to egg, and asthmatics, in particular, are at high risk for severe allergic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Egg accounted for 7 percent of severe anaphylactic reactions in infants and children in a German survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Fatal reactions to egg are rare but have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In contrast, eczema onset after 12 months of age was not associated with food allergy. However, sensitization is not equivalent to clinical allergy. A small, randomized trial of egg avoidance in children with egg sensitization and atopic dermatitis demonstrated that egg elimination decreases the extent and severity of eczema, indicating that egg sensitization was clinically relevant in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

If such patients develop asthma, they are at increased risk for more severe allergic reactions to foods.</p><p>Some children with atopic dermatitis experience delayed flares one to two days after ingesting egg. These delayed reactions are not IgE mediated but instead are likely due to T cell-mediated mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In a series of over 500 patients diagnosed with EoE, egg was found to be the second most common allergen triggering symptoms, confirmed on endoscopy after allergy testing (prick skin testing and patch testing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Elimination of food triggers has been found to be an effective treatment for EoE.

FPIES is typically characterized by profuse vomiting, pallor, lethargy, and diarrhea two to six hours after ingestion of a triggering food. In one US cohort, egg was identified to be the trigger in 11 percent of children with FPIES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. FPIES due to egg allergy was also reported in an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/egg-allergy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. FPIES is presented in greater detail separately.

A five-month-old boy developed protein-losing enteropathy and resultant hypogammaglobulinemia due to egg exposure through maternal breast milk. Maternal elimination of egg led to resolution of symptoms, and reintroduction of egg into the maternal diet caused recurrence of symptoms.
