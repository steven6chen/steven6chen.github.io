Some babies are born with cerebral palsy, but others get the disorder later on. Babies with cerebral palsy are often slow to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22197819\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cerebral palsy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of cerebral palsy can be mild or more serious. Many symptoms are caused by weakness or stiffness of parts of the body. These symptoms change as a baby gets older (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82772\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82772 \">table 1</a>). People with cerebral palsy continue to have symptoms for life. But the disorder does not get worse with age.</p><p>Many children with cerebral palsy also have other problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble drinking or eating &ndash; This can lead to other problems, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not gaining enough weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Choking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid reflux &ndash; This is when acid that is normally in the stomach backs up into the esophagus. It can cause a burning feeling in the throat or chest, belly pain, and nausea or vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble thinking and learning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with hearing and speaking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing &ndash; Many children with cerebral palsy have 1 eye that turns in or out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The child might have jerking movements, get stiff, stop responding and stare for a few seconds, or pass out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A curved spine (called &quot;scoliosis&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with bladder control</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation (having too few bowel movements)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dislocation of the hip joints</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain &ndash; Children with cerebral palsy often have pain. This can be related to issues like muscle stiffness, problems with the hip joints, or constipation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22197834\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for cerebral palsy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your child's doctor or nurse might be able to tell if your child has cerebral palsy by doing an exam and learning about your child's symptoms. But doctors can't always tell because children develop at different rates during the first 2 years of life. He or she might refer you to a specialist to help find out if your child has cerebral palsy.</p><p>Possible tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An MRI &ndash; This is an imaging test that takes pictures of the inside of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An EEG &ndash; An EEG is a test that measures electrical activity in the brain and records brain wave patterns. A doctor might do this test if your child has seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22197849\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cerebral palsy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will refer you to an &quot;early intervention&quot; program. These programs have different types of experts. They will teach you how to help your child do everyday things he or she might have trouble doing. These include eating, speaking, walking, and learning.</p><p>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Your child's doctor might prescribe medicines that help treat symptoms such as stiff muscles, unusual body movements, or seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Equipment &ndash; These include devices such as leg braces, walkers, or a wheelchair to help your child get around.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutrition &ndash; Some children need special diets to help them gain enough weight to be healthy. Some children need to get some or all of their food through a tube that goes directly into the stomach. This is called a &quot;gastrostomy tube&quot; or &quot;g-tube.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; For children with very severe symptoms, doctors sometimes do surgery to put the child's legs or arms into a correct position.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22197864\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with mild forms of cerebral palsy often live as long as people who don't have the disorder. Children with more serious forms of the disease might not live as long. Special equipment and teaching can help your child move and learn as much as he or she can.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
