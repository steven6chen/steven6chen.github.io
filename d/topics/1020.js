An estimated 250,000 catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) occurred annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In acute care settings, rates have declined by as much as 50 percent from 2008 to 2014 as a result of initiatives designed to prevent these infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; nonetheless, CRBSIs remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among patients receiving chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, and hemodialysis. Infection rates are dependent on the type of CVC used and are reported as the number of bloodstream infections per 1000 intravascular device days. CVC infection rates are highest with short-term noncuffed, nontunneled, and nonmedicated hemodialysis and multilumen catheters and lowest with subcutaneous central venous ports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Management of CRBSI depends on the decision to salvage, exchange, or remove the catheter. Antibiotic lock therapy has been used in conjunction with systemic antibiotics in attempts to salvage infected long-term catheters (tunneled catheters and subcutaneous central ports), and its use will be reviewed here.</p><p>Diagnosis, general management, and prevention of CRBSI are reviewed elsewhere.

Bacteria in a biofilm can be difficult to eradicate with traditional systemic antibiotic administration and can lead to recurrent CRBSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Antibiotic concentrations must be 100- to 1000-fold greater to kill sessile bacteria within a biofilm as compared with planktonic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. The antibiotic lock is a highly concentrated antibiotic solution, often combined with an anticoagulant such as heparin, administered in an amount sufficient to fill and dwell in the catheter lumen when the catheter is not in use. Anticoagulants are thought to be beneficial in ALT for treatment of CRBSI by interfering with fibrin formation and allowing increased antibiotic penetration into microbial biofilm. Dwell times may range from four hours to three days, depending on solution stability and amount of time available when the catheter is not in use. Antibiotic lock solutions should be withdrawn from the catheter when it is needed for intravenous access to avoid systemic exposure to high concentrations of antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anticoagulants that can result in toxic effects, particularly with prolonged use or when used in low-weight neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13928254\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few high-quality data to guide the use of antibiotic lock therapy (ALT) (see <a href=\"#H50341318\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below).

None of the studied lock solutions contained heparin, and treatment regimens varied in antibiotic choice, dwell time, duration of therapy, and use of concomitant systemic antibiotics. Two studies reported similar success rates of ALT alone compared with ALT and systemic antibiotics, but these were nonrandomized and subject to selection bias and may have underestimated a difference between groups caused by a lack of statistical power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50341354\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical guidelines recommend ALT with systemic antibiotics for catheter salvage in children with CRBSI when clinically possible because of vascular access difficulties in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

One retrospective study found no difference in failure rates between ALT and systemic therapy alone: failures in the setting of systemic therapy alone were associated with early central venous catheter removal (&lt;72 hours after onset of CRBSI) compared with delayed removal (4 to 13 days after CRBSI onset), which was more common in children who received ALT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50341361\"><span class=\"h2\">Port-related CRBSI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ALT is an attractive treatment option for CRBSI of implanted vascular ports because removal of a totally implanted device is a challenge, particularly if performed multiple times in the same patient.

We use heparin in the antibiotic lock solution unless there is a contraindication to heparin (eg, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). In some patients, namely infants and young children, in whom large systemic doses of heparin would be dangerous if the lock solution were inadvertently flushed, we use lower concentrations of heparin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21998020\"><span class=\"h2\">Other solution additives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies investigating the effects of N-acetylcysteine (used to degrade mature biofilm matrices) in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a> have noted synergistic antimicrobial activity and promising catheter salvage rates for a variety of organisms associated with biofilm production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections/abstract/23,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,59</a>].

For hemodialysis catheters, the ALT can dwell in the catheter during the interval between sessions, up to 72 hours.
