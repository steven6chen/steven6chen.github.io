The term &quot;tardive&quot; differentiates these dyskinesia from acute dyskinesia, parkinsonism, and akathisia, which appear very soon after exposure to antipsychotic drugs.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of TD will be reviewed here. Other aspects of TD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Prevention and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manifestations of TD can include a variable mixture of orofacial dyskinesia, athetosis, dystonia, chorea, tics, and facial grimacing. The symptoms involve the mouth, tongue, face, trunk, or extremities. Tardive tremor has been rarely described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Oral, facial, and lingual dyskinesia are especially conspicuous in older adult patients. These may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protruding and twisting movements of the tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pouting, puckering, or smacking movements of the lips</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retraction of the corners of the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bulging of the cheeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chewing movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blepharospasm</p><p/><p>Tongue movements are insidious in onset and at first may be limited to subtle back and forth or lateral movements. In other patients, tic-like facial movements or increased blink frequency are initial manifestations.</p><p>Dyskinesia of the limbs also occur, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twisting, spreading, and &quot;piano-playing&quot; finger movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tapping foot movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dystonic extensor postures of the toes</p><p/><p>Limb involvement is often more severe in younger individuals in whom dystonic postures and ballistic movements may occur.</p><p>Dyskinesia of the neck and trunk may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrocollis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Torticollis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial dystonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder shrugging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rocking and swaying movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rotatory or thrusting hip movements</p><p/><p>Respiratory dyskinesia may produce tachypnea, irregular breathing rhythms, and grunting noises that are commonly misinterpreted as primary respiratory problems.</p><p>Severe orofacial dyskinesia is highly disfiguring and may greatly interfere with speech, eating, swallowing, or breathing, while truncal dystonia can be extremely distressing and interfere with gait and mobility.</p><p>TD is much less common in children than in adults. The manifestations of TD in children have been called &quot;withdrawal emergent symptoms&quot; because they usually occur when antipsychotic drugs are discontinued.</p><p>Cognitively intact and psychiatrically stable patients are usually very aware of mild and early manifestations of TD. In contrast, failure to complain of TD symptoms often occurs in patients with little insight who are chronically institutionalized or psychotic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Subtypes of tardive dyskinesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of TD variants or subtypes have been described based on the type of involuntary movements that predominate in these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tardive dystonia refers to TD in which more sustained dystonic manifestations such as retrocollis, opisthotonus, shoulder dystonia, hyperextension of the arms or legs, blepharospasm, and jaw dystonia predominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Tardive dystonia occurs more frequently in patients younger than age 40; it may have a lower spontaneous remission rate than TD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tardive akathisia refers to late-appearing motor restlessness. It differs from acute akathisia by the presence of dyskinesia and absence of subjective motor restlessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tardive tics, tardive myoclonus, tardive stereotypy, tardive tremor, and tardive oral pain syndromes have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], but these are rare and often difficult to distinguish from other manifestations of TD or from effects of the patient's underlying psychosis. Many of these additional manifestations were well described in early reports of TD. They typically coexist with the more common manifestations. They illustrate the notion that TD encompasses a variety of motor manifestations without delineating a specific movement disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>TD has also been classified based upon symptom duration or chronologic appearance and remission. In this scheme, subtypes include transient TD, withdrawal emergent TD, and persistent TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient TD is limited to a relatively brief period of time during the course of treatment with antipsychotic drugs followed by spontaneous resolution</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal emergent TD has been used to describe dyskinesia in pediatric patients that occurs transiently, immediately following the discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent TD refers to long-lasting or permanent TD</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of TD is insidious and typically occurs while the patient is receiving an antipsychotic drug. TD may appear as early as one to six months following antipsychotic drug exposure. In the initial literature, it was believed that TD occurred only after two or more years of antipsychotic treatment.</p><p>It is common for TD to first appear after a reduction in dose, after switching to a less potent antipsychotic drug, or following discontinuation of an antipsychotic drug. This &quot;unmasking&quot; effect is due to the hypokinetic effects of antipsychotic drugs that frequently cause a delay in the recognition of TD. Withdrawal dyskinesia usually resolves within several weeks of antipsychotic drug discontinuation, but is likely to be a precursor of more persistent forms of TD.</p><p>Although once considered a persistent or permanent condition, TD is often reversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In initial studies, remission rates of persistent TD were only 5 to 40 percent, but early identification of TD in younger outpatient populations is associated with remission in 50 to 90 percent of patients. Remission of TD usually occurs within several months after antipsychotic drug withdrawal, but may occur as late as one to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The prognosis of TD in patients who require continued antipsychotic drug treatment is unknown. In most cases, TD either remains unchanged or is suppressed by the hypokinetic effects of the antipsychotic drug when used at a higher dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of TD is based upon the presence of dyskinetic or dystonic involuntary movements, a history of at least one month of antipsychotic drug treatment, and the exclusion of other causes of abnormal movements.</p><p>It is important to identify TD as early as possible since, as noted in the preceding section, the potential for remission appears to be related to the duration of symptoms before discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the diagnosis of TD is usually straightforward, clinicians should consider other important causes of involuntary movements, such as Wilson disease or Huntington disease, in patients being treated with antipsychotic drugs for a psychiatric disorder. A comprehensive, methodical drug history is an essential part of the diagnostic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Diagnostic tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Advanced Huntington disease is readily identified clinically by the positive family history, marked gait abnormality, and dementia. Early-stage Huntington disease can be harder to differentiate from TD because involuntary choreiform movements may be the only manifestation, and may be mild.</p><p>TD must be distinguished from the stereotypies and psychotic mannerisms associated with chronic schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], autism, and severe mental retardation. Stereotypies in schizophrenia are usually less rhythmic, more stereotyped, and more complex in appearance than the simpler, repetitive, and often rhythmic involuntary movements associated with TD. Unlike TD, choreoathetosis and dystonia are absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features#H7611398\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Stereotyped behaviors'</a>.)</p><p>TD should also be distinguished from other antipsychotic drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes that often coexist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects#H272233794\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H191680213\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Akathisia occurs both early and late in antipsychotic drug treatment and, in the case of tardive akathisia, may persist after cessation of such treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Akathisia is a subjective feeling of motor restlessness accompanied by inability to sit or stand still. Manifestations may include repeated leg crossing, weight shifting, or stepping in place. When akathisic movements of the legs occur late in antipsychotic drug treatment and are associated with dyskinesia elsewhere in the body, they are referred to as tardive akathisia and should be considered a manifestation of TD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute dyskinesia typically occurs immediately after introduction of an antipsychotic drug, but may resemble TD. Acute dyskinesia can sometimes occur late in treatment after switching to a more potent antipsychotic drug, or can occur episodically during treatment with long-acting injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a> esters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tremor is an uncommon manifestation of TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Tremor is nearly always a reversible sign, usually associated with rigidity and akinesia, due to drug-induced parkinsonism. Rabbit syndrome is a rare perioral tremor that also may occur late in antipsychotic treatment, but, like other tremors, remits with discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous orofacial dyskinesia often occurs in older adults. The mean prevalence of dyskinesia among patients treated with antipsychotic drugs has been estimated at 20 percent, compared with a mean prevalence of 5 percent in untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This indicates that a significant background level of spontaneous dyskinesia is present in the general population, especially in older adults. Spontaneous oral dyskinesia in older adults is often associated with edentulism and dementia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meige syndrome is an idiopathic cranial dystonia with onset in middle age manifested by blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia. Meige syndrome, blepharospasm, and oromandibular dystonia are all phenotypically indistinguishable from orofacial TD. Thus, differentiating these conditions from TD depends on an adequate drug history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a young person, tardive dystonia involving axial or cervical muscles should be differentiated from primary torsion dystonia, which has a slowly progressive course and is not related to antipsychotic drug exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tourette syndrome is easily identified by a history of fluctuating motor and vocal tics since childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tourette-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tourette syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other, less common possibilities in the differential diagnosis of TD include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial grimacing and choreoathetosis associated with chronic liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chorea or dystonia with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chorea due to hyperthyroidism or hypoparathyroidism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatic or lupus chorea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute drug intoxications with levodopa, amphetamines, anticholinergic drugs, certain calcium channel blockers with dopamine receptor blocking effects (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flunarizine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flunarizine</a> and cinnarizine, which are unavailable in the United States), antidepressants, and anticonvulsants</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basal ganglia calcification and structural disorders of the basal ganglia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
