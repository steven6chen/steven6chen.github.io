Perforation may occur anywhere along the esophagus, but there is a predilection for rupture at these key anatomic areas. As an example, iatrogenic injuries to the cervical esophagus can occur during endoscopy at Killian's triangle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75732\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75732 \">figure 2</a>), an area lacking a posterior esophageal muscularis and bordered by the horizontal cricopharyngeus muscle inferiorly and the oblique inferior constrictor muscles superiorly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822727\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased intraluminal pressure at the anatomic sites of narrowing, as well as sites narrowed by a malignancy, foreign body, or physiologic dysfunction, can lead to rupture of the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71821\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71821 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82026\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82026 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>More than one half of all esophageal perforations are iatrogenic and most of these occur during endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>].

Leakage of esophageal and gastric contents into the mediastinum creates a necrotizing inflammatory process that can lead to sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The near doubling of overall mortality from 14 to 27 percent with a delay in diagnosis greater than 24 hours after perforation emphasizes the importance of a prompt diagnosis and treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82453 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The diagnostic studies performed to confirm the clinical suspicion of esophageal perforation are discussed in detail elsewhere.

This is especially true of spontaneous perforation where the clinical suspicion is low. This often leads to the evaluation of more common medical conditions such as myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and peptic ulcer disease.

The exceptions to performing a primary repair include a cervical perforation that cannot be accessed but can be drained, diffuse mediastinal necrosis, a perforation too large for the esophagus to be re-approximated, an esophageal malignancy, preexisting end-stage benign esophageal disease (eg, achalasia), or if the patient is clinically unstable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Surgical alternatives to primary repair in these settings are discussed below (see <a href=\"#H3823773\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to primary surgical repair'</a> below). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359219748\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary surgical repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A primary repair is performed when, in the judgement of an experienced surgeon, the closure can heal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H527634957\"><span class=\"h3\">General principles for esophageal repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following general principles are used to perform a repair of a perforation of the cervical, thoracic, or abdominal esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61590\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61590 \">figure 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, devitalized tissue is debrided from the perforation site. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, the muscular layer is incised longitudinally along the muscle fibers superior and inferior to the perforation to expose the entire extent of the mucosal injury. Failure to visualize the proximal and distal extent of the mucosal disruption is the most common reason for a persistent leak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third, the mucosa is closed with absorbable interrupted sutures and the muscularis layer is closed with interrupted nonabsorbable sutures. Narrowing of the esophageal lumen should be avoided using precise reapproximation.</p><p/><p>When there has been a delay in diagnosis greater than 24 hours, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substantial extraluminal contamination from the leakage of fluid and debris has occurred, the integrity of the repair can be enhanced with the use of a vascularized pedicle flap. The most common flap used is the intercostal muscle flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54219 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80384\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80384 \">figure 6</a>). Other options for a flap include serratus muscle, latissimus dorsi muscle, diaphragm, parietal pleura, omentum, and gastric fundus. </p><p>If the gastric fundus is used to buttress a lower esophageal repair, the gastroesophageal junction should be placed in the normal intra-abdominal location to avoid severe and debilitating gastroesophageal reflux. A Dor fundoplication (partial anterior wrap) is an excellent alternative for an intra-abdominal perforation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359219755\"><span class=\"h3\">Cervical perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical perforations are typically more easily treated than perforations of the thoracic or intra-abdominal esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A primary repair of a cervical perforation is performed if the perforation can be clearly visualized and there is no distal obstruction. Otherwise, drainage of the perforation is adequate to control the leak since the anatomic structures of the neck typically confine extraluminal contamination to a limited space and thereby enhance spontaneous healing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67045 \">figure 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3823780\" class=\"local\">'Drainage only'</a> below.)</p><p>The surgical approach to control a perforation in the cervical esophagus begins with an incision in the left neck along the lower third of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55814 \">figure 8</a>), unless the perforation is documented or visualized from the right neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The surgical dissection proceeds with identification of the anatomic structures such as the carotid sheath, trachea, spine, and recurrent laryngeal nerve, which should be preserved. Soft retractors, including the fingers of the surgeon and first assistant, are used to retract the esophagus and trachea in order to avoid recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. </p><p>The following surgical techniques are used to expose and manage the perforated cervical esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68608\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68608 \">figure 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SCM muscle and carotid sheath are retracted laterally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The middle thyroid vein and the omohyoid muscle are divided</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The trachea and esophagus are bluntly retracted medially</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The esophagus is carefully and bluntly dissected posteriorly along the retropharyngeal plane</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All devitalized tissue is debrided</p><p/><p>Blunt dissection should be carried into the mediastinum posterior to the esophagus and anterior to the prevertebral fascia to assure adequate drainage of the infection. The perforation should be primarily repaired when clearly visualized, as described above. However, if the perforation is not clearly visualized, then the perforation site is drained. (See <a href=\"#H527634957\" class=\"local\">'General principles for esophageal repair'</a> above.)</p><p>The wound is irrigated, widely drained with Jackson-Pratt drains that are brought out through the bottom of the incision or through a separate dependent site, and loosely closed in layers with interrupted absorbable sutures. Alternatively, when heavy contamination is present, the wound may be left open and packed with wet to dry dressings or a wound vac (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>). The authors do not routinely use a nasogastric tube. A feeding tube is only considered in patients presenting with significant malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359219762\"><span class=\"h3\">Thoracic perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough knowledge of the relationship of the esophagus to the adjacent vital structures is necessary when planning the surgical approach to a thoracic perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54206 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61563\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61563 \">figure 10</a>). The level of the perforation of the thoracic esophagus determines the surgical approach to controlling the leak and repairing the perforation. As an example, a mid-esophageal perforation is approached through a right thoracotomy at the sixth or seventh intercostal space while a distal esophageal perforation is approached through a left thoracotomy at the seventh or eighth intercostal space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68858\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68858 \">figure 11</a>). </p><p>The following surgical techniques are used to expose the thoracic esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78253 \">figure 12</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to entering the thoracic cavity, a posteriorly based intercostal muscle flap is harvested as a potential buttress of a primary repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54219 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thoracotomy is performed, the lung is retracted anteriorly, which can be facilitated by the mobilization of the pleural reflection and inferior pulmonary ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78253 \">figure 12</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pleural space is evacuated of debris and the devitalized tissue in the mediastinum is debrided. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The esophagus is encircled with a Penrose drain proximal to the perforation to facilitate dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56059\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56059 \">figure 13</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The perforation is localized and the repair is planned based on the size of the perforation, the friability of the esophagus, the degree of surrounding contamination, and the clinical status of the patient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The repair is then buttressed with a pedicled flap (eg, intercostal muscle flap) utilizing interrupted absorbable sutures. An alternative to the intercostal muscle flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80384\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80384 \">figure 6</a>) is the parietal pleura flap if the intercostal muscle is not available or the intercostal blood supply has been compromised (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66998 \">figure 14</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The wound is copiously irrigated and drained utilizing two 28 to 32 French chest tubes.

The authors prefer to place feeding tubes on clinically stable patients with significant extraluminal contamination when a prolonged intensive care unit admission is anticipated or on patients who present with significant malnutrition.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H527634015\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principles for the management of an intra-abdominal esophageal perforation are the same as those described for perforations of the cervical and thoracic esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55061 \">figure 15</a>). These surgical principles include a careful dissection to isolate the esophagus without damaging vital structures, removal of debris and devitalized tissues, and debridement of the area of perforation. </p><p>A laparotomy is the preferred approach to repair a perforation of an intra-abdominal esophagus. The left triangular ligament (peritoneal attachment of the liver to the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]) of the liver is divided and the liver is retracted laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63869\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63869 \">figure 16</a>). This maneuver provides access to the esophageal hiatus, which is proximal to the perforation. Division of the short gastric vessels will help mobilize the gastroesophageal junction for improved exposure and access to the perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56689 \">figure 17</a>). </p><p>Following the primary suture repair, the hiatus is closed posteriorly with interrupted silk sutures to create an opening that accommodates only the esophagus and a fingertip. A Dor (partial 180&deg; anterior wrap) or a Nissen (complete 360&deg; posterior wrap) fundoplication is used to buttress the site of repair depending on the site of perforation and patients' preoperative history of swallowing dysfunction. The peritoneum is then copiously irrigated with isotonic saline, Jackson-Pratt drains are placed near the site of repair, and a feeding jejunostomy tube is placed for postoperative alimentation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H527633838\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This approach is used to manage patients with an esophageal perforation at any site: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional support is necessary until oral feedings can be initiated and effectively sustained. The patient remains NPO for approximately seven days.

As an example, severe mediastinitis associated with extra-esophageal tissue friability and necrosis from a delay in diagnosis can preclude a primary repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Options in these circumstances include drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diversion procedures. </p><p>Endoscopic covered stent placement has been described as an alternative procedure to primary repair; however, there are no patient selection guidelines. For patients with a distal malignancy or achalasia, an esophagectomy may be warranted.

The goal of this approach is to reconstruct the esophageal lumen and control the leakage and septic contamination of adjacent tissues in patients unlikely to tolerate a second operative procedure to re-establish continuity of the esophagus. Alternatively, a T-tube may be inserted into the perforation to create a controlled fistula when a patient cannot tolerate more extensive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3823787\"><span class=\"h3\">Diversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A procedure to divert the esophageal contents rather than perform a primary repair of a perforation is indicated when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is unstable </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repair is not possible secondary to the size of the defect or friability of surrounding tissue </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preexisting esophageal disease is present</p><p/><p>The goals of a diversion procedure include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control and drain extraluminal contamination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Divert the esophagus proximally with a cervical esophagostomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of the remaining esophagus </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain gastric diversion with a gastrostomy tube and feeding tube access with a jejunostomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-feeding-gastric-versus-post-pyloric\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral feeding: Gastric versus post-pyloric&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the diaphragmatic hiatus </p><p/><p>A thoracotomy is typically performed to mobilize and resect the esophagus, and debride and drain the mediastinum.

An esophagectomy at the time of perforation may be performed if the patient is clinically stable and there is minimal contamination.</p><p>A perforation of the distal esophagus following dilatation in patients with achalasia requires special mention. The degree of preoperative dysfunction dictates treatment strategies, as illustrated in the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have maintained an adequate nutritional status and do not have a dilated, tortuous thoracic esophagus (sigmoid esophagus), primary repair of the perforation site and a myotomy on the contralateral side of the esophagus with a fundoplication can be performed. Many surgeons perform a partial fundoplication procedure to prevent reflux as well as to buttress the repair. The edges of the fundoplication are sewn to the edge of the myotomy, and the stomach covers the repair.

As long as patients remain clinically stable, contrast esophagography is performed at five to seven days and resumption of oral intake under observation is considered depending on the results.
