The evaluation and causes of syncope in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of syncope in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of syncope in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4240187512\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a common pediatric complaint in ambulatory settings, dizziness is a vague term that can describe many conditions, including lightheadedness (presyncope), anxiety, intoxication, ataxia, visual disturbance, hyperventilation, weakness, depression, and true vertigo. Young children may not be able to describe their symptoms well, making their evaluation challenging. However, a thorough history and physical examination can establish a diagnosis in most cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3781563\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dizziness describes a disturbed sense of relationship to space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dizziness-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is a chief complaint commonly used to describe many conditions. </p><p>True vertigo and pseudovertigo provide further categorization of dizziness: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True vertigo refers to the perception that the patient is rotating relative to the environment (subjective vertigo) or that the environment is rotating relative to the patient (objective vertigo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dizziness-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It results from a disturbance somewhere in the vestibular system, which has both peripheral and central nervous system components. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudovertigo describes complaints of dizziness without any rotary component. Common causes include orthostatic hypotension, presyncope, and hyperventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H315239420\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The semicircular canals and vestibule (together known as the labyrinth) make up the peripheral vestibular system and are located within the inner ear, adjacent to the cochlea in the petrous portion of the temporal bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63141\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63141 \">figure 1</a>). These organs send impulses to the central components of the vestibular system, located in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cortex, via the eighth cranial nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55465 \">figure 2</a>). Efferent impulses travel through the vestibulospinal tract to the peripheral muscles and also within the medial longitudinal fasciculus to cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. Cranial nerve VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve) is responsible for both hearing and vestibular function. A disturbance anywhere in the vestibular system may cause patients to have vertigo and associated signs and symptoms such as hearing loss, perceptual changes in vision (eg, blurry vision), and nystagmus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102367\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children may use &quot;dizziness&quot; to describe a wide range of symptoms; it is useful to divide diagnoses into those that represent true vertigo with a sensation of spinning from pseudovertigo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51313 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H3781563\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above). The most common causes of true vertigo in children are otitis media, migraine headache, and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dizziness-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-10</a>]. Head injury and central nervous system infection are the most frequent life-threatening etiologies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102374\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102382\"><span class=\"h3\">Head trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head injuries from falls, sports, and motor vehicle accidents are common among children. A fracture of the temporal bone may damage the labyrinth and classically presents with dizziness, hearing loss, and hemotympanum. A direct blow to the temporoparietal or parietooccipital regions can cause a vestibular concussion, which produces nausea, vertigo, and nystagmus in addition to the classic symptoms of a concussion. A whiplash (hyperflexion and extension) injury may injure the basilar artery, which partially supplies the labyrinth, causing spasm and producing vestibular symptoms. Blunt or penetrating trauma to the middle ear may disrupt the oval window where the stapes articulates with the inner ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63141\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63141 \">figure 1</a>) and can cause a perilymph fistula. Loud sounds or pneumatic otoscopy causes true vertigo in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma&quot;, section on 'Adjacent structures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury#H4278194063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Post-traumatic vertigo and dizziness'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102389\"><span class=\"h3\">Central nervous system infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral and bacterial infections of the central nervous system may affect the vestibular system and cause symptoms of dizziness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertigo. Patients will usually present with additional signs and symptoms of infection such as fever, headache, neck stiffness, or mental status changes. Several retrospective reviews found no cases of meningitis or encephalitis among children presenting to outpatient clinics with dizziness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dizziness-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6</a>]. However, any child with fever or mental status changes deserves careful evaluation to rule out these potentially serious conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102396\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracranial tumor or abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although vertigo is a rare presenting sign in patients with a space occupying brain lesion, any mass in or around the fourth ventricle or central vestibular system may cause dizziness, vertigo, or nystagmus due to compression, displacement, or localized inflammation of the brain. The symptoms typically worsen with changes in head position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102403\"><span class=\"h3\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strokes in children most commonly present with hemiplegia or altered mental status (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-and-young-adults-etiology-and-clinical-features#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Etiology and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>). However, symptoms of dizziness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertigo may occur if the defect occurs in the area of the basilar artery, which partially supplies the labyrinth, the vestibular nuclei of the brainstem, or in vessels that supply any of the vestibular centers in the cortex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102410\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug overdose and other poisons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of certain recreational drugs may cause vertigo and nystagmus, including barbiturates, ethanol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, and phencyclidine. Pseudovertigo may occur in patients with poisoning due to benzodiazepines, carbon monoxide, typical antipsychotic medications, and cyclic antidepressants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102417\"><span class=\"h2\">Common conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102425\"><span class=\"h3\">Otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otitis media is the most common cause of vestibular disturbances in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dizziness-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Between 60 and 80 percent of infants have at least one episode of AOM by one year of age, and 80 to 90 percent by two to three years. An acute episode of otitis media (serous or suppurative) can irritate the vestibular system and cause dizziness, vertigo, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hearing loss. Complications of otitis media that may also cause vertigo include mastoiditis, an infection of the mastoid air cells, and cholesteatoma, an abnormal collection of keratin on the tympanic membrane caused by repeated episodes of otitis media. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Symptoms and signs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mastoiditis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mastoiditis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholesteatoma-in-children#H1910589297\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholesteatoma in children&quot;, section on 'Natural history and complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102432\"><span class=\"h3\">Migraine syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migrainous vertigo is a term used to describe episodic vertigo in patients with a history of migraines or with other clinical features of migraine. Unlike adults, who generally present with headache, children may present with other manifestations of migraine such as vertigo with nystagmus and frequently have no associated headache. In addition, up to 19 percent of children with classic migraine have vertiginous symptoms during their aura. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-migraine#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular migraine&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p>Basilar artery migraines, which are most common before the age of 20 years, present with two or more basilar-type aura symptoms including vertigo. Symptoms resolve within two hours and are usually followed by a throbbing headache (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73674\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73674 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Migraine with brainstem aura (basilar-type migraine)&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102439\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) is a disorder of early childhood manifested by recurrent episodes of brief disequilibrium. During the attacks, the child appears frightened and off balance, often reaching out to steady him or herself. The events may be associated with nystagmus, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. Older children will grab nearby persons or furniture for support to prevent falling and may complain of vertigo or dizziness. Episodes usually last less than a minute and are not associated with an altered consciousness. They usually recur in clusters, occurring daily for several days in a row, then remitting for several weeks, and recurring again. A family history of migraine headaches is frequently present. The neurologic examination is normal between episodes. The disorder typically remits spontaneously by five years of age. Many patients subsequently develop typical migraine headaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Benign paroxysmal vertigo'</a>.)</p><p>Unlike other causes of nystagmus, patients with BPVC have normal eye and neurologic examinations between episodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pendular-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pendular nystagmus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363944\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects of medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of medications list dizziness as a possible side effect. Several affect the labyrinth and may cause true vertigo, including aminoglycosides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">minocycline</a>, and salicylates.

As an example, if the visual system indicates that a person is stationary (eg, viewing the interior of a cabin on a ship), but the vestibular system senses ongoing head movements (eg, due to motion of the ship), the vestibular and visual cues conflict and engender symptoms of motion sickness. Furthermore, if the semicircular canals and otolith organs produce sensory cues that are incongruous, motion sickness can be evoked that is independent of vision. Common symptoms include pallor, diaphoresis, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, and usually occur during travel in a boat, car, or airplane. It is much more common in children who have migraines compared to those without. True vertigo with a sensation of spinning is rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motion-sickness#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motion sickness&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motion-sickness#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motion sickness&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102460\"><span class=\"h3\">Paroxysmal torticollis of infancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paroxysmal torticollis is a benign, self-limited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of head tilt often accompanied by vomiting, pallor, irritability, ataxia, or drowsiness that usually presents in the first few months of life. The periodic episodes of torticollis can randomly alternate from side to side. The individual attacks typically last for hours, but occasionally last for days. The episodes occur less frequently as the child gets older and disappear in most cases by five years of age. The pathogenesis of benign paroxysmal torticollis has not been determined. It is considered to be a &quot;migraine equivalent&quot; disorder. Some patients go on to develop migraine headaches or benign paroxysmal vertigo. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-torticollis-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired torticollis in children&quot;, section on 'Benign paroxysmal torticollis'</a>.)</p><p>Paroxysmal torticollis of infancy has findings that are similar to spasmus nutans; however, unlike patients with paroxysmal torticollis, children with spasmus nutans typically have head nodding and strabismus with amblyopia. In addition, patients with spasmus nutans do not go on to develop migraine headaches.

Vestibular neuritis is a common cause of vertigo in adults but is rare in children. Patients prefer to lie still with the affected ear facing up. There is no associated hearing loss. It is thought to be due to a postinfectious inflammation or viral infection of the vestibular nerve, with mumps, measles, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpesvirus being known pathogens. However, a history of a recent viral infection is present in less than half of patients. Symptoms may last from weeks to months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Labyrinthitis, a specific type of vestibular neuritis, presents with the sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo.

Patients typically complain of vertigo with changes in head position, especially upon waking in the morning and sitting up in bed. Episodes usually last less than one minute. The symptoms can be elicited by the Dix-Hallpike (or Nylen-Barany) maneuver, in which the patient's neck is extended and turned to one side before he or she is placed supine rapidly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52232 \">figure 3</a>). In patients with BPPV, nystagmus should occur within 30 seconds.

Episodes may be accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as pallor, nausea, and vomiting. Meniere disease is associated with endolymphatic hydrops with distortion and distention of the membranous, endolymph-containing portions of the labyrinthine system. Meniere disease can begin at any age, but patients typically present with symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40. Meniere syndrome in children is most often associated with congenital malformations of the inner ear.

It may be congenital, causing permanent sensorineural hearing loss, or acquired. Acquired causes include barotrauma (from diving, descending in an airplane that is not well pressurized, sneezing, coughing, or any sudden change in pressure in the middle ear), head injury, middle ear trauma, and middle ear infection. The diagnosis is suggested by sudden or fluctuating hearing loss accompanied by dizziness or vertigo. Symptoms should worsen with changes in middle ear pressure and may be elicited by pneumatic otoscopy, having the patient Valsalva (positive Hennebert's sign), or Tullio phenomenon (vertigo and nystagmus in response to a loud sound).

Features of the nystagmus: its type (horizontal, torsional, vertical), its tendency to suppress with visual fixation, and whether or not its direction alters with gaze position can suggest a central versus peripheral localization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76359 \">table 4</a>). Evaluation of nystagmus is discussed in more detail separately.

A careful neurologic examination should be performed since the presence of additional neurologic abnormalities also strongly suggests the presence of a central lesion. A search should be made for cranial nerve abnormalities, motor or sensory changes, dysmetria, or abnormal reflexes. Unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders (eg, otitis media, benign paroxysmal vertigo) generally cause patients to lean or fall toward the side of the lesion. Children may be uncomfortable and reluctant to move because of their vertigo, but they are still able to walk. Romberg testing will cause the patients to fall or tilt to one side. Patients with an acute cerebellar lesion (eg, posterior fossa tumor) are often unable to walk without falling. The direction of tilting or falling with Romberg testing may vary.</p><p>While the ability to walk and the direction of falling may provide useful clues to the origin of vertigo, in practice, it may be difficult to persuade a patient with severe vertigo to attempt to walk.

Evaluation of static and dynamic vestibular function can assist in differentiating vertigo from central versus peripheral nervous system causes but requires patient cooperation. Instructions on the performance and interpretation of these tests are discussed in more detail separately.</p><p>More invasive caloric testing is performed by infusing warm or cold water into the ear. Otoscopy should first be performed first to ensure that cerumen is not obstructing the flow of water to the tympanic membrane and to verify that there is no tympanic membrane perforation. The head of the patient should be tilted at 30 degrees for optimal stimulation of the semicircular canals. When warm water at 44&deg;C is infused into an ear, the normal response is nystagmus with the fast component toward the infused ear. The opposite response occurs when cold water at 30&deg;C is infused; the normal response is nystagmus with the fast component away from the cold water-infused ear. The volume of water can be increased if no response occurs with the initial attempt. Lack of a response to warm or cold water on one side suggests disease on that side, usually in peripheral lesions. Central vestibular disorders may also cause caloric hyposensitivity, especially if they involve the vestibular root entry in the medulla. This test can cause significant distress, including nausea and vomiting in patients who are awake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26102553\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases of true vertigo, additional evaluation is dictated by the history and physical examination. Neuroimaging is indicated for patients with a history of trauma (computed tomography [CT] of the head with temporal bone windows) or patients with evidence of central vestibular abnormalities, altered mental status, or associated focal neurologic findings (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the brain or head CT). Once increased intracranial pressure is excluded by physical examination or neuroimaging, lumbar puncture should be performed in patients with suspected meningitis, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis. In patients with a suspicion of seizures, an electroencephalogram should be arranged.</p><p>Other specialized vestibular testing (eg, electronystagmography, rotary chair testing, posturography, and audiometry) is indicated when central versus peripheral vertigo cannot be established or when vertigo is prolonged or incapacitating. These tests are usually performed by a neurologist or otorhinolaryngologist.
