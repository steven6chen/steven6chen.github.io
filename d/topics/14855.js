Infection<em> with S. notomytis</em> has only rarely been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, rat bite fever (RBF) is typically caused by <em>S. moniliformis</em>. The disease is rare, with only several cases documented each year. As an example, between 2000 and 2012, only 17 cases were identified in California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, its actual incidence is unknown because RBF is not a nationally notifiable disease, and many cases go undiagnosed since these bacteria are difficult to identify and are likely to respond to empiric antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.) </p><p>The risk of RBF due to <em>S. moniliformis</em> after a rat bite is reported to be 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and an estimated 20,000 rat bites occur in the United States each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Historically, over 50 percent of reported cases occurred in children, and RBF was most likely to be seen in those living in poverty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the demographics have changed, and now include pet store workers and laboratory technicians as rats have become popular pets and research subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>In Asia, RBF is known as sodoku (<em>so</em>: rat, and <em>doku</em>: poison) and it is primarily caused by <em>S. minus </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>S. notomytis</em> has also been reported in Japan. This species was originally isolated from a spinifex hopping mouse in 1979 and was described genetically in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. moniliformis</em> and <em>S. notomytis</em> can be grown in culture, although they are difficult to grow. By contrast, <em>S. minus</em> is unable to be cultured.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>S. moniliformis</em></strong> &mdash; <em>S. moniliformis</em> is a pleomorphic fastidious branching gram-negative bacillus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53591\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53591 \">picture 1</a>). It stains irregularly and can be mistaken for gram-positive pleomorphic rods. The bacteria are microaerophilic; they require specific media for isolation (10 to 20 percent serum) and incubation in a 5 to 10 percent CO<sub>2</sub> environment. Sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS), an anticoagulant added to most aerobic blood culture bottles, inhibits growth of <em>S. moniliformis</em>. However, anaerobic culture bottles, resin bead culture systems, and trypticase soy agar and broth may demonstrate growth since they do not contain SPS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><em>S. moniliformis</em> grows slowly. As a result, the clinical microbiology laboratory should be notified if there is clinical suspicion for the disease so that cultures can be held for up to seven days to allow identification. On solid agar plates, pinpoint colonies representing cell wall-defective variants (L-forms) may surround larger gray-white colonies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Inoculation into thioglycolate broth enriched with serum produces growth in typical &quot;puff-ball&quot; or &quot;cotton ball&quot; colonies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].<em> </em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><em>S. moniliformis</em> can be identified by a characteristic fatty acid profile on gas chromatography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, biochemical testing is often difficult, and results are inaccurate because of the fastidious nature of the organism. Identification by 16S rDNA sequencing is feasible although this method is only specific to the genus (ie, <em>Streptobacillus</em>) and not the species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Mass spectrometry-based identification methods have also been used on direct clinical specimens when clinical suspicion is high, bypassing the need for culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>S. notomytis</em></strong> &mdash; <em>S. notomytis</em> can be grown in culture similar to <em>S. moniliformis</em>, but is distinguishable by 16S rDNA sequencing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>S. minus</em></strong> &mdash; <em>S. minus</em>, previously known as <em>Spirocheta morsus</em> or <em>Sporozoa muris</em>, is a short, thick gram-negative tightly coiled spiral that has 2 to 6 helical turns spanning 0.2 to 0.5 micrometers. This organism cannot be cultured on synthetic media but may be seen with Giemsa or Wright stain, or with dark-field microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79338844\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. moniliformis</em> is commonly found in the nasal and oropharyngeal flora of rats and probably other rodents. Most rats are asymptomatic; however, on occasion they may demonstrate signs of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rate of nasopharyngeal carriage of <em>S. moniliformis</em> by rats (even healthy laboratory rats) is quite variable, reportedly being as high as 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Infection with <em>S. moniliformis</em> can result from a bite or scratch from an infected or colonized rat, or from handling rats at home or the workplace (eg, laboratories or pet stores). The risk of infection after a rat bite has been reported to be as high as 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Transmission can also result from oral contact, such as kissing pet rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of patients with rat bite fever do not report having been bitten or scratched [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/8,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,16</a>].</p><p>Infection with <em>S. moniliformis</em> can also occur after ingestion of food or water contaminated with infected rat feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. When infection occurs through this route, it is known as &quot;Haverhill Fever&quot;; this was named after an outbreak in 1926 when 86 persons in Haverhill, Massachusetts developed a febrile illness following the consumption of contaminated unpasteurized milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A similar outbreak occurred in 1983 among 304 boarding school children in Chelmsford, England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The mode of transmission of <em>S. minus, S. notomytis,</em> and <em>S. moniliformis</em> is similar; however, infections with <em>S. minus</em> and <em>S. notomytis</em> have not been associated with contaminated food or water. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of rat bite fever (RBF) depend upon the causative organism (<em>S. moniliformis</em> or <em>S. minus</em>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2467860439\"><span class=\"h2\">S. moniliformis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of RBF due to <em>S. moniliformis</em> can range from a mild flu-like illness to fulminant sepsis in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,22</a>]. The mortality rate of RBF is approximately 13 percent in untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1648712400\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals with infection due to <em>S. moniliformis</em>, the incubation period is typically less than seven days following exposure. Symptoms start abruptly with fever, myalgias, migratory arthralgias, vomiting, pharyngitis, and headache. By the time symptoms develop due to a bite or scratch, the wound has usually resolved and there is no regional adenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Individuals who acquire RBF through ingestion have more severe vomiting and an increased incidence of pharyngitis compared with those who acquire disease through a bite.</p><p>The initial symptoms are frequently followed by a maculopapular rash on the extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], which is then followed by polyarthritis in up to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rash is typically seen on the extensor surface of the extremities and may involve the palms and soles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although usually maculopapular, it can be petechial, purpuric, or present with hemorrhagic vesicles. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arthritis typically involves the knees, followed by ankles, elbows, wrists, shoulders, and hips. The presentation of arthritis can vary, but the majority of cases are polyarticular, and in some, the distribution is asymmetric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p>Although symptoms may resolve spontaneously without antibiotic therapy, in some cases, the fever can have a relapsing course and the arthritis may persist for several years. In a case report of a child with knee swelling, pathogenic bacteria were found to persist in joints for months despite clearance of the organisms from blood and other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3253301888\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports illustrate a variety of complications of RBF. Bacteremia was the most common complication during the Chelmsford and Haverhill outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]. Other serious complications include meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], endocarditis (including prosthetic valve endocarditis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>], myocarditis, pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], focal abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], and multiorgan failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29</a>]. Two cases of fulminant sepsis and death in previously healthy adults occurred in the United States in 2003, one from a rat bite in a pet store and the other most likely from a sick pet rat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Endocarditis is the best described complication. Individuals often have a history of valvular disease, and symptoms are similar to endocarditis due to other causes, including the presence of anemia, Osler's nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly. In one case series, the mortality associated with <em>S. moniliformis</em> endocarditis was 53 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2467860457\"><span class=\"h2\">S. minus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to infection with <em>S. moniliformis</em>, RBF caused by <em>S. minus</em> has a longer incubation period (one to three weeks). In addition, the initial wound may reappear at the onset of the systemic illness or persist with edema and ulceration with associated regional adenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Approximately 50 percent develop a red-brown macular rash. Arthritis is not a common clinical finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2614471674\"><span class=\"h2\">S. notomytis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. notomytis</em> was reported to cause fever, rash, and polyarthritis in a woman from Japan following a rat bite on her finger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79338908\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific lab abnormalities in patients with RBF. Moderately elevated white blood cell counts and sedimentation rates have been reported in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The findings in the joint fluid can vary. One case report described a four-year-old patient with rat bite fever and polyarticular arthritis in his distal radioulnar and knee joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Fluid from the distal radioulnar joint had a leukocyte count of only <span class=\"nowrap\">31/microL,</span> whereas the knee joint had a leukocyte count of <span class=\"nowrap\">75,250/microL;</span> both specimens were culture positive for <em>S. moniliformis</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rat bite fever (RBF) is most commonly diagnosed empirically because growing <em>S. moniliformis</em> or <em>S. notomytis</em> is difficult and <em>S. minus</em> is unable to be cultured. No serologic test is available; however, analysis of the 16S rDNA gene sequence has been used for diagnosis on appropriate specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/16,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,36,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79338920\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An empiric diagnosis of RBF is made in the patient with an unexplained febrile illness or sepsis and a history of rat exposure. This is particularly true in patients with a relapsing or intermittent fever pattern, a maculopapular rash, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> polyarthritis or polyarthralgia (typically involving the knees and ankles).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100365408\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitive diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confirming a diagnosis of RBF is extremely difficult.

SPS is present in most aerobic blood culture media and it inhibits growth of the organism. The microbiology laboratory should be alerted so that specific media and culture conditions can be used to optimize isolation of the organism. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even with appropriate diagnostic testing, synovial fluid cultures can be negative in cases of uncomplicated disease as the etiology of the arthritis may be due to an immune mediated mechanism rather than actual infection with the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>16S rDNA testing (if available) on appropriate specimens such as tissue (heart valve, bone) or synovial fluid may be useful for diagnosis of <em>S. moniliformis </em>or <em>S. notomytis</em>. However, the sensitivity and clinical utility of such testing has not been proven. This type of testing is not available on routine blood samples.</p><p/><p><em>S. minus</em> is unable to be cultured, and a microbiologic diagnosis is made through demonstration of the organisms on examination of blood, exudate, or tissues using Giemsa or Wright stains, or darkfield microscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79338890\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with some combination of fever, maculopapular rash, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> polyarthritis is broad and involves a wide variety of infectious organisms. These agents can usually be diagnosed through readily available culture, serologic, and molecular techniques. It is important to obtain a recent travel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exposure history to help prioritize the likely infectious organisms. Detailed discussions of how to diagnose these infections are discussed separately in appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever and rash -</strong> A general approach to the patient with fever and rash is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-and-rash-in-the-immunocompetent-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever and rash in the immunocompetent patient&quot;</a>). However, in the patient presenting with a fever and rash characteristic of rat bite fever (RBF), the following alternative infectious organisms should be considered: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Viral &ndash;</strong> There are a number of viral etiologies that should be considered in a patient with fever and a maculopapular rash. These principally include enterovirus, measles, parvovirus, HIV, dengue, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Infection with these viruses should be considered in the patient with a history of appropriate activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exposure. As an example, enterovirus infection should be considered in the patient who works with children. These infections are most commonly diagnosed via serology or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

Such management includes copious irrigation of the wound and assessment regarding the need for tetanus or rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Rats and other small rodents are rarely infected with rabies. If the animal is not available for testing, post-exposure prophylaxis for bites should be considered individually in consultation with public health authorities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;, section on 'Wound care'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to use rabies prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048994210\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penicillin is the treatment of choice for RBF, and prompt therapy can prevent severe complications. The mortality rate of RBF is approximately 13 percent in untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>].</p><p>Empiric therapy should be started immediately in patients with a compatible clinical presentation and exposure history, since laboratory confirmation is difficult and may take several days. If the organism is detected, antimicrobial susceptibility can be determined using standard testing (eg, disk diffusion, broth macrodilution). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The dose and duration of antibiotic therapy for RBF depends upon the clinical presentation. Given the rarity of the illness, therapy is mostly guided by case reports and modest clinical experience. Most cases of RBF present as uncomplicated disease, and lower doses of IV therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral therapy can be used in such individuals. More aggressive treatment and monitoring is required for those with serious invasive infections. (See <a href=\"#H1048993869\" class=\"local\">'Serious invasive infections'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncomplicated disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncomplicated disease consists of fever, myalgias, polyarthritis, polyarthralgias, vomiting, headache, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rash. In these individuals, the total duration of treatment is 14 days. Most patients are initially treated with intravenous antibiotics. If initial therapy results in a rapid defervescence and a significant improvement in symptoms, an oral regimen can be substituted after five to seven days of intravenous therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> are the antimicrobial agents of choice.

These include meningitis, endocarditis (including prosthetic valve endocarditis), myocarditis, pneumonia, focal abscesses, bacteremia, pyogenic arthritis, and multiple organ failure. Although death has been reported in up to approximately 50 percent, the majority of these occurred in the absence of effective antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rat-bite-fever/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>].</p><p>The optimal dose of penicillin for patients with serious complications is unclear as there are no adequately controlled clinical trials. We favor giving doses of penicillin adequate to treat other serious penicillin-susceptible streptococcal infections, such as endocarditis. For patients with prosthetic valve involvement, higher doses of penicillin and the addition of an aminoglycoside should be considered, similar to the treatment of other streptococcal endocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial therapy of prosthetic valve endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial therapy of prosthetic valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Streptococci'</a>.).</p><p>In both adults and children who are allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins, desensitization to a beta-lactam should be considered in patients with complicated disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;</a>).

Individuals with pet rats should not kiss or lick them, and should wash their hands after handling the animals.</p><p>Preventing severe disease among persons who have exposure to rats involves increasing their awareness of the signs and symptoms of RBF. In addition, following a rat bite it is reasonable to administer a three-day course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-v-potassium-oral-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin V</a> (adults: 500 mg four times per day; children: 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in three or four divided doses, maximum 2 grams per day).

Infection<em> with S. notomytis</em> has only rarely been reported. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>S. moniliformis</em> is a pleomorphic fastidious branching gram-negative bacillus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53591\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53591 \">picture 1</a>); <em>S. notomytis</em> is similar. Both require specific media for isolation and must be incubated in a 5 to 10 percent CO<sub>2</sub> environment. <em>S. minus</em> is a tightly coiled spiral gram-negative rod. It can be identified by darkfield examination, but cannot be cultured on artificial media. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with <em>S. moniliformis, S. notomytis,</em> or <em>S. minus</em> can result from a bite or scratch from an infected or colonized rat, or from handling rats at home or the workplace (eg, laboratories or pet stores). Infection with <em>S. moniliformis</em> can also occur after ingestion of food or water contaminated with infected rat feces. (See <a href=\"#H79338844\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with infection due to <em>S. moniliformis </em>or<em> S. notomytis</em>, the incubation period is typically less than seven days following exposure. Symptoms start abruptly with fever, myalgias, migratory arthralgias, vomiting, pharyngitis, and headache. By the time symptoms develop due to a bite or scratch, the wound has usually resolved and there is no regional adenopathy. (See <a href=\"#H2467860439\" class=\"local\">'S. moniliformis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of complications of RBF due to <em>S. moniliformis</em> have been reported, including meningitis, endocarditis, and bacteremia. (See <a href=\"#H3253301888\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with <em>S. minus</em> has a longer incubation period (one to three weeks). In addition, the initial wound may reappear at the onset of the systemic illness or persist with edema and ulceration with associated regional adenopathy. (See <a href=\"#H2467860457\" class=\"local\">'S. minus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RBF is most commonly diagnosed clinically because growing <em>S. moniliformis</em> is difficult, and <em>S. minus</em> does not grow on artificial media. No serologic test is available. However, analysis of the 16S rDNA gene sequence has been used for diagnosis on appropriate specimens. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with RBF includes local care of the wound in those reporting a bite and antibiotics. Penicillin is the treatment of choice, and prompt therapy can prevent severe complications. Empiric therapy should be initiated in patients with a compatible clinical presentation and exposure history, since laboratory confirmation is difficult and may take several days. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent infection following a rat bite, a three-day course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-v-potassium-oral-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin V</a> (adults: 500 mg four times per day; children: 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in three or four divided doses, maximum 2 grams per day) is reasonable; however, the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis is unknown.
