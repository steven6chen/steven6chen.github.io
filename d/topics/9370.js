Primary IVH is uncommon, accounting for only about 3 percent of all spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Intraventricular hemorrhage more commonly occurs in the setting of intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage (secondary IVH).</p><p>The assessment of the patient with IVH focuses on identifying the underlying cause of the hemorrhage, which may have significant treatment implications. The distinction between primary and secondary IVH is critical in this regard. Common to patients with IVH, regardless of etiology, is a risk for sudden and potentially fatal obstructive hydrocephalus, requiring acute clinical decision-making regarding the use of external ventricular drainage and other interventions.</p><p>This topic discusses the causes, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of IVH.

The following demographic characteristics were reported in a 2008 review of published cases series of primary intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p><ul class=\"bulletCompact-block\"><li>The median age is 55 years (range 9 to 91 years)</li><li>Males and females are equally represented</li><li>Half of patients have a history of hypertension</li></ul></p><p>The epidemiology of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is discussed separately.

IVH is estimated to complicate 40 percent of ICH and 10 percent of SAH cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In one retrospective review, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy was associated with IVH risk, volume at presentation, and subsequent expansion in patients with deep or lobar ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The underlying causes of ICH and SAH are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonaneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>IVH can also complicate closed head injury. Usually, this is in the setting of other traumatic brain injury, including contusion and traumatic SAH; isolated IVH is a relatively rare complication of head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>Primary IVH is uncommon; in consequence, studies estimating the frequency of various etiologies have been limited. Retrospective case series derived from tertiary referral centers are subject to ascertainment bias. Further, definitions of primary IVH have varied among different authors and studies. While most limit their use of the term to hemorrhages entirely localized within the ventricle, others have included hemorrhages that originate within 15 mm of the ependymal surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The latter criteria invariably classify thalamic, caudate, and medial putaminal bleeds (usually secondary to chronic hypertension) associated with IVH as primary IVH.</p><p>Among series which more strictly limit the definition of IVH, vascular malformations are the most frequently identified cause of primary IVH. In small case series, vascular malformations have been identified in 14 to 58 percent of patients with primary IVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/2,9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-14</a>]. Reported causes of IVH include:</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>Vascular malformations (usually arteriovenous malformations or arteriovenous fistulae) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/1,2,9-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9-18</a>].</li><li>Intraventricular tumors (papilloma, neurocytoma, meningioma, metastases, astrocytoma, ependymoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/10,19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19-25</a>].</li><li>Intraventricular aneurysms developing within the distal lenticulostriate or choroidal arteries (occasionally reported in association with Moyamoya disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/9,15,21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,21,26</a>]. Occasionally aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery, posterior inferior cerebellar artery, or basilar tip rupture into the ventricles without other overt subarachnoid blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/2,9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,13</a>].</li><li>Moyamoya disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/1,2,15,21,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15,21,27-29</a>].

About half of these patients have chronic hypertension; this is believed, but not known, to cause IVH in the same way it is understood to cause ICH. It is speculated that some patients with IVH may have had a small hypertensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage, too small to see on CT or MRI, which arises in proximity to the ventricular system and produces IVH as its primary manifestation.

A minority of patients have frank loss of consciousness at the onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Symptoms are usually sudden in onset; however, nearly a quarter of patients are reported to have progressive or fluctuating symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The degree of neurologic impairment, often measured as the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>) is an important prognostic indicator (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below).</p><p>Focal neurologic findings are relatively uncommon with primary IVH and most typically involve cranial nerve abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Such cranial nerve palsies are generally of the &quot;false localizing&quot; type due to stretching across the basilar skull surface, and include dysfunction of the sixth and third nerves. Seizures are not common, but can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/1,9,10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10,16</a>]. Most patients are hypertensive on presentation, and some will have an elevated body temperature or suffer cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nuchal rigidity is inconsistently present.</p><p>The clinical symptoms and signs of IVH reflect a sudden increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) that results from sudden introduction of blood volume into the intracranial space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition to pressure effects, it is speculated that blood products in the cerebrospinal fluid space may affect brain function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with IVH are at risk for sudden neurologic deterioration which may result from obstructive hydrocephalus, recurrent hemorrhage or other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>Acute obstructive hydrocephalus can result when cerebrospinal fluid circulation is obstructed by blood clots. Patients with blood in the third or fourth ventricle are at most risk of this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One-half to two-thirds of patients with IVH have some degree of hydrocephalus on the initial CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/2,10,11,14,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,11,14,38</a>]. This can be rapidly fatal and usually requires urgent intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/7,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,37</a>]. Patients may also develop communicating hydrocephalus as a delayed complication of IVH; this usually presents more gradually. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</li><li>Recurrent hemorrhage or hemorrhage extension occurs in 10 to 20 percent of patients with IVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/11,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,37</a>]. The highest risk of this is in those with an underlying etiology of vascular malformation or aneurysm or in the setting of a coagulopathy.</li><li>Cerebral vasospasm with ischemia is unusual in cases of primary IVH, but this complication has been described in isolated cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/18,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,39,40</a>]. In contrast, vasospasm is a common complication of aneurysmal SAH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</li><li>Medical complications are common in the setting of IVH and may manifest primarily as neurologic deterioration. These include pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and other infections, and electrolyte imbalance. Other medical complications of IVH include cardiovascular instability, deep venous thrombosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding.</li></ul></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of primary IVH overlaps with those of aneurysmal SAH, which because of its implications for urgent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions should be immediately excluded with emergent CT scan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other etiologies of a headache with sudden onset include cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke, among others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81710 \">table 2</a>). A noncontrast head CT will distinguish IVH from these other entities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thunderclap headache&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-contrast head CT is the test of choice to diagnose IVH. CT rapidly and reliably identifies blood within the ventricular system, helps to identify parenchymal ICH or SAH associated with the IVH, and also identifies concurrent hydrocephalus.</p><p>In patients with suspected primary IVH, close examination of the brain regions surrounding the ventricles (caudate and thalamus, in particular) should be undertaken to exclude an ICH that has ruptured into the ventricles. If present, the diagnostic evaluation for ICH should be pursued. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) Similarly, the presence of subarachnoid blood in the basal cisterns or cortical sulci should raise concern for aneurysmal SAH with secondary IVH, and the diagnostic evaluation should be modified accordingly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The extent of IVH can be graded by CT. The most commonly applied scoring system is the Graeb score (GS) which grades IVH on a scale of 1 to 12 based upon the extent of bleeding and the presence of ventricular enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Other scoring systems for IVH have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. While these may more accurately quantify the amount of IVH; they are more complicated to use and are not widely implemented. The GS correlates with level of consciousness, Glasgow coma scale, and also has implications for outcome (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/11,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,38</a>].</p><p>The CT scan should be repeated emergently for any neurologic deterioration to identify recurrent hemorrhage or obstructive hydrocephalus. CT scans are also used to monitor hydrocephalus, particularly during attempts to clamp or remove a drain. Transcranial ultrasonography has been suggested as a possible alternative to serial CT to monitor ventricular size, but the reliability and reproducibility of this technique has yet to be independently validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other neuroimaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other neuroimaging studies are required to define the etiology of a primary IVH. CT does not provide significant information about the cerebral vasculature, and it has limited ability to identify malignancies. In the absence of an obvious precipitant such as trauma or coagulopathy, most patients with primary IVH should undergo further neuroimaging, typically to include magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography <span class=\"nowrap\">(MRI/MRA)</span>.</p><p>If the <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRA</span> is unrevealing, conventional angiography should follow. In a prospective observational study of patients with IVH who underwent catheter angiography, vascular lesions were found in 11 of 17 (65 percent), including 10 patients with arteriovenous malformations, and one with aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A retrospective review of published case series similarly estimated the yield of angiography at 56 percent, additionally identifying cases of Moyamoya and dural arteriovenous fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If the cause of the IVH remains undetermined, it is reasonable in some cases to consider repeat contrast MRI and possibly catheter angiography one to two months following the initial studies after reabsorption of blood products has occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests that are important to include are blood clotting studies (PT, PTT, and platelet count). A toxicology screen should also be considered.</p><p>Because electrolyte imbalances can complicate IVH, these should be measured at baseline and followed regularly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of IVH focuses on cessation of bleeding, relieving hydrocephalus, and controlling intracranial pressure (ICP).</p><p>Specific therapy aimed at treating the underlying cause should be undertaken (aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation obliteration). Coagulopathies should be corrected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular malformations of the central nervous system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have a moderate to severe IVH (impaired alertness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> GS &gt;8) should be followed in an intensive care setting. Medical complications are common (eg, pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular instability, supraventricular tachycardia, hypo- and hypernatremia) requiring appropriate monitoring and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. The head of the bed should be placed at 30 degrees or greater to decrease ICP and reduce the risk of aspiration. Euvolemia should be maintained using isotonic crystalloid solutions, and any elevations in body temperature should be treated aggressively.</p><p>For prevention of deep venous thrombosis, mechanical thromboprophylaxis using intermittent pneumatic compression stockings is recommended until a bleeding source has been identified and secured. At that time, antithrombotic therapy can be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because seizures are an infrequent complication of IVH, prophylactic antiepileptic drugs are not generally used; but should be initiated immediately should seizures occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimum blood pressure management in patients with IVH remains undefined. Aggressive blood pressure lowering may minimize the risk of further hemorrhage, but must be weighed against the risk of decreased cerebral perfusion in patients with increased ICP. One small pilot trial in 48 patients with IVH found a significantly decreased risk of hemorrhage enlargement in patients who achieved a prespecified goal of lowering mean arterial pressure by 30 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>It seems reasonable to gradually lower elevated blood pressure in patients with normal ICP. Intravenous antihypertensives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a> are typically used, although other agents are acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In the absence of better data specific to IVH, the guidelines outlined for blood pressure management in the setting of ICH seem reasonable.

The EVD can also be connected to a transducer that records ICP.</p><p>An EVD is indicated for patients with IVH with hydrocephalus and neurologic decline. Rarely, bilateral EVDs may be needed if hemorrhage obstructs the foramen of Monro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The major complications associated with EVD are catheter occlusion due to clotted blood at the intraventricular orifice and infection. The former may be relieved by irrigation or catheter replacement. Symptoms suggestive of infection should prompt cerebrospinal fluid analysis for cell count and culture along with antibiotic therapy as appropriate. Staphylococci are the most common pathogens. Higher rates of bacterial <span class=\"nowrap\">ventriculitis/meningitis</span> occur with longer duration of EVD placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In one study, those with infection had a mean duration of EVD of 17 days compared to 10 days in those who did not develop infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Prophylactic catheter change does not clearly improve the risk of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections of cerebrospinal fluid shunts and other devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraventricular thrombolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complications associated with EVD provide a rationale for the use of intraventricular thrombolysis (IVT). Theoretically, instillation of thrombolytic agents into the ventricles can speed clot resolution, avoiding problems with catheter occlusion and shortening the duration of EVD use. It is also possible, although unproven, that more rapid resolution of IVH may decrease the long-term incidence of communicating hydrocephalus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below).</p><p>A number of small case series have provided support for IVT, showing increased clot resolution and decreased mortality compared with nonrandomized or historical controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/3,36,49-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,36,49-57</a>]. </p><p>A case-control study reported that after multivariate analysis, IVT did not affect long-term outcomes although it did hasten clot lysis and reduced repeat EVD placement and long-term shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In a randomized study of 12 patients with IVH, intraventricular injections at 12 hour intervals were associated with significantly greater clot resolution than injection with normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This trial was stopped after urokinase was no longer available. The Intraventricular Hemorrhage Thrombolysis Trial, a multicenter randomized controlled study, enrolled 48 patients and compared 3 mg rt-PA to normal saline injected through an EVD every twelve hours until clot reduction or a clinical endpoint occurred (median duration of dosing was 7.5 days for rtPA and 12 days for placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The rate of clot resolution was faster for rtPA than placebo (18 versus 8 percent per day). Rates of death and ventriculitis were lower than expected and did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Symptomatic bleeding complications were more frequent in the rtPA group (23 versus 5 percent), but this did not reach statistical significance. Observational data suggest that lower doses of rt-PA (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> may be safer and equally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Larger randomized studies are underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. As an example, Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage (CLEAR-III) is comparing treatment with 1 mg rt-PA or placebo injected through an EVD every eight hours until clot reduction or a clinical endpoint occurs, or 12 doses have been given. Preliminary safety data based on the first 36 patients enrolled showed a mortality rate of 8 percent, symptomatic rebleeding rate of 8 percent, and no bacterial ventriculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>Bleeding complications are a concern with IVT; recurrent IVH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ICH expansion is reported in 8 to 20 percent of patients after IVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/15,37,55,56,60,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37,55,56,60,64</a>]. Typically, patients with known aneurysm or vascular malformation were excluded from early studies of IVT. However, IVT has been used without complication in a few reported cases after the vascular malformation or aneurysm was surgically treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/15,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,65-67</a>], and even before surgery, in few patients with these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/16,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,68</a>]. Systemic bleeding complications are unlikely to be significantly increased with IVT; in CLEAR IVH, systemic coagulation parameters were similar after administration of rtPA and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>It is also possible that the risk of bacterial <span class=\"nowrap\">meningitis/ventriculitis</span> may be increased with IVT therapy, but this has not been demonstrated so far [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/37,55,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,55,60</a>]. IVT has not been associated with systemic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>We suggest that the use of IVT in patients with IVH be restricted to patients who do not have an unsecured vascular malformation or aneurysm, a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or a coagulopathy and also to experienced centers that have an established IVT protocol.

Advanced age, underlying coagulopathy, Glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less, hydrocephalus at presentation are also associated with a higher risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/2,11,31,38,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,31,38,70</a>].

The authors speculated that blood in the third ventricle may affect critical contiguous structures in the midbrain.</p><p>Other long-term complications of IVH include:</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>Neurocognitive sequelae. Patients with significant IVH are often confused, agitated and disoriented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These symptoms are often slow to recover and a significant proportion (about half of survivors) are left with disabling cognitive deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/1,10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,15</a>].</li><li>Noncommunicating hydrocephalus. IVH along with a secondary <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/fibrotic</span> response may lead to impaired absorption of cerebrospinal fluid at the arachnoid granulations. This may be manifest by a more subacute decline in cognition, gait, and urinary continence that can occur weeks or later after the initial IVH, or as a failure to wean off EVD. Such patients may require permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of patients with IVH require a shunt placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/15,51,55,66,78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,51,55,66,78-81</a>].

Recurrent hemorrhage is uncommonly reported after IVH. In one series, 2 of 14 survivors had a subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], while in another series there was no recurrent bleeding in a group of 13 patients after 67 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The risk of this complication is likely highest in those with an unrecognized <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unsecured vascular lesion (eg, Moyamoya) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/26,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,82</a>].</li></ul></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can complicate intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (secondary IVH). Less commonly, IVH occurs in isolation (primary IVH).</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>The most commonly identified cause of primary IVH is a vascular malformation. Up to half of patients with primary IVH do not have a cause (other than hypertension) identified. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</li><li>Primary IVH usually presents with sudden headache, nausea and vomiting, and impaired alertness. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</li><li>Patients with a clinical presentation of IVH should undergo immediate noncontrast head CT. The primary purpose is to exclude SAH and to identify the IVH and evaluate its severity and potential for obstructive hydrocephalus. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</li><li>Individuals with primary IVH should have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MR angiography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conventional angiography to identify the underlying etiology, particularly a vascular malformation or aneurysm that may require surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other neuroimaging studies'</a> above.)</li><li>Because acute obstructive hydrocephalus often complicates IVH that involves the third and fourth ventricles, such patients should be closely monitored. When neurologic deterioration occurs, emergent CT scan should be done to exclude the development of obstructive hydrocephalus or recurrent hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</li><li>We recommend external ventricular drainage for neurologic deterioration that occurs with ventricular enlargement. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'External ventricular drain'</a> above.)</li><li>The use of intraventricular thrombolysis holds promise for improved outcomes in patients with IVH and obstructive hydrocephalus, but definitive recommendations await the results of further clinical trials. The use of intraventricular thrombolysis can be considered in experienced centers that have established protocols. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Intraventricular thrombolysis'</a> above.)</li></ul></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18042404\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Dr. James Pacelli, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraventricular-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Darby DG, Donnan GA, Saling MA, et al.
