This type of pneumonia is slightly different from the type of pneumonia that people normally think of when they hear that term. Mycoplasma pneumonia is caused by different bacteria than run-of-the-mill pneumonia. The symptoms it causes are also slightly different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17479358\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumonia in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumonia come on slowly in children. At first, a child might have a headache and a mild fever, and just not feel well. Later, the child might get a sore throat and cough. These symptoms are not that different from those of a common cold. But Mycoplasma pneumonia can also cause other symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A red, bumpy rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the knees, hips, or other joints</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17479373\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you think your child has the symptoms described above, see a doctor or nurse right away.</p><p><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stops breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts to turn blue or very pale</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a very hard time breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59786 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts grunting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Looks like he or she is getting tired from having to work so hard to breathe</p><p/><p>If a doctor or nurse thinks your child might have pneumonia, he or she will do an exam and listen to your child's breathing. He or she might also take an X-ray of your child's chest and run some blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17479411\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Mycoplasma pneumonia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mycoplasma pneumonia is treated with a specific type of antibiotic. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. They are available in pill or liquid form. Make sure that your child takes all of his or her antibiotics, even if he or she starts feeling better before finishing them!</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17479426\"><span class=\"h1\">How soon will my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children who are treated with antibiotics start to feel better 2 to 3 days after they start taking the medicine. Even so, your child might still feel tired or have a cough for a few weeks or even months after being treated. It might also be a few months before he or she can breathe comfortably while exercising.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17479441\"><span class=\"h1\">How should I take care of my child at home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Try to keep your child as comfortable as possible, and make sure that he or she gets lots of rest. You should also give your child plenty of fluids to drink. For babies and very young children, it might help to offer small amounts of fluids frequently (instead of large amounts less often).</p><p>Medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can help relieve pain and discomfort caused by fever. The correct dose depends on your child's weight, so ask your child's doctor how much to give.</p><p>Do not give your child medicines that quiet a cough. These medicines do not usually work well, and they can have serious side effects in children. Also, do not give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines that contain aspirin to children younger than 18 years. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome.</p><p>Call your child's doctor or nurse if your child does not seem to be getting better after 2 days. Your child might need a different type of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17479456\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to keep my child from getting pneumonia again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wash your child's hands often with soap and water. It is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infection. You can use an alcohol rub instead, but make sure the hand rub gets everywhere on your child's hands.</p><p>There are several vaccines that help to protect against pneumonia. Talk to your child's doctor or nurse about which vaccines your child should get, and when he or she should get them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17479473\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-prevention-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia prevention in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
