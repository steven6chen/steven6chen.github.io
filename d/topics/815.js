Angioedema may occur in isolation, accompanied by urticaria, or as a component of anaphylaxis.</p><p>The pathogenesis and causes of angioedema will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of acute angioedema are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding the epidemiology of angioedema are limited, although it affects both adults and children and is not a rare disorder. In a retrospective review of all hospital admissions in New York State over 13 years, angioedema was the second most common &quot;allergic&quot; disease to necessitate hospitalization, exceeded only by asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this study, the number of angioedema hospitalizations per year more than doubled during the study period, suggesting that the prevalence may be increasing.</p><p>African Americans were disproportionately affected, as they accounted for 42 percent of the admissions for angioedema, but only 16 percent of the state's population.</p><p>The epidemiology of specific forms of angioedema, such as hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioedema results from a loss of vascular integrity that allows fluid to move into tissues. Exposure of the vasculature to inflammatory mediators causes dilation and increased permeability of capillaries and venules. Fluid collects asymmetrically in the areas in which the vasculature has been altered, and these areas (eg, face, larynx, bowel wall) are <strong>not</strong> typically gravitationally dependent. Angioedema differs from the edema associated with cardiovascular, renal, and liver disease (eg, heart failure, renal failure, venous obstruction). Edema is usually due to an alteration in Starling's forces, such as an increase in intracapillary pressure or a reduction in the plasma oncotic pressure (ie, any cause of severe hypoalbuminemia) in the presence of normal vasculature. Edema affects gravitationally dependent parts of the body and fluid collects symmetrically in those areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The known causes of angioedema can be subdivided into three groups, depending upon the underlying mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F97087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97087 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mast cell-mediated etiologies, in which angioedema results from release of mast cell-derived mediators that increase vascular permeability.

These forms of angioedema are <strong>not</strong> associated with urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pruritus and are diagnosed and treated differently from other types of angioedema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Etiologies of unknown mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mast cell-mediated etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell-mediated angioedema is associated with urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pruritus in many instances. This form of angioedema is pathologically similar to urticaria, although it takes place in the deeper levels of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. Mast cells can be activated via several mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58834 \">table 2</a>). Activated mast cells release inflammatory mediators, including histamine, heparin, leukotriene C<sub>4</sub>, and prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>, which cause dilation of venules in the dermis and enhance venule permeability with resultant tissue edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Development, identification, and physiologic roles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Surface receptors and signal transduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mast cell-mediated angioedema is treated with antihistamines and glucocorticoids. However, if angioedema is encountered in the setting of anaphylaxis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is the most important intervention. The treatment of mast cell-mediated angioedema is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute angioedema, with or without other symptoms of allergic reactions, may be triggered by foods, drugs, latex, exercise, the stings of various insects, and a growing list of other uncommon allergens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70667 \">table 3</a>). Angioedema is a common component of anaphylaxis, and since anaphylaxis is treated differently from isolated angioedema (ie, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>), the clinician must be vigilant for other signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (such as urticaria, pruritus, flushing, throat tightness, bronchospasm, and hypotension) in patients presenting with angioedema.</p><p>The classic type of allergic reaction results from immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, Gell and Coombs type I hypersensitivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 4</a>). The reaction typically occurs within minutes to two hours following exposure to the trigger. However, some IgE-mediated allergic reactions are delayed in onset, such as allergic reactions to certain meats (lamb, beef, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pork) that can lead to reactions with prominent angioedema, beginning two to six hours after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Acute diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-meats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy to meats&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Isolated angioedema is a relatively uncommon presentation of an allergic reaction. In a series of 112 patients with penicillin allergy confirmed by skin testing, only 1 patient had experienced isolated angioedema without urticaria during the presenting allergic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, it can occur. Examples include reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin and NSAIDs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Direct mast cell release</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells can be nonspecifically stimulated to release their proinflammatory mediators by certain medications and pharmaceuticals, such as opiates and radiocontrast media. This type of angioedema is accompanied by urticaria in most cases. IgE is not involved, and skin testing or in vitro testing is rarely helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Aspirin and NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, can cause acute <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span> and can exacerbate chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span>. There are six known types of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs, which are often difficult to distinguish from one another based upon clinical history alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chronic urticaria with or without angioedema'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The more common type of NSAID reaction is believed to be due to the pharmacologic properties of the medications on mast cells. NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which mediates the generation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid within mast cells and other leukocytes. NSAID administration results in increased formation of proinflammatory mediators, leading to angioedema in susceptible individuals. NSAIDs that nonselectively inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, and most others) can potentially induce this effect, and patients often react to multiple agents. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, are tolerated by most patients who have reacted to nonselective NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although rare exceptions are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Management of patients with these reactions is reviewed separately.

The diagnostic approach to NSAID reactions is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic urticaria with or without angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic urticaria refers to urticaria that continues to recur for a period of six weeks or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Angioedema is present in at least one-half of patients with chronic urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Chronic urticaria may persist over months to years and is more common in women, particularly between the ages of 40 and 50 years. In most cases of chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema,</span> a specific cause cannot be identified. This disorder is reviewed in more detail separately.

Angioedema can result from either overproduction of bradykinin or inhibition of bradykinin degradation. Mast cells are not believed to be involved in this form of angioedema, and <strong>pruritus and urticaria are</strong> <strong>absent</strong>. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema, unlike histamine-mediated angioedema, frequently affects the gastrointestinal mucosa, leading to bowel wall edema and presenting with episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea.</p><p>Perturbations in kinin pathways resulting directly from the actions of medications (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) or from deficiencies of C1 inhibitor (C1INH) are the main causes of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. The treatment of bradykinin-induced angioedema is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bradykinin-mediated angioedema does not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Instead, this type of angioedema is treated with drugs that act on the bradykinin pathway (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ecallantide</a>), preparations of C1INH concentrate (human), or plasma replacement (depending on the cause).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">ACE inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors account for approximately 30 percent of all angioedema cases presenting to emergency departments in both community and tertiary care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. ACE inhibitors impair bradykinin degradation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67838\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67838 \">figure 1</a>). Angioedema related to ACE inhibitors most often affects the lips, tongue, mouth, larynx, pharynx, and subglottic tissues. Urticaria and itching are absent. ACE inhibitors can also cause intestinal edema, and the sudden onset of abdominal pain, nausea, and sometimes vomiting in an older adult should prompt inquiries about the use of ACE inhibitors. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of angioedema with the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telmisartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telmisartan</a>, appears to be considerably lower than with ACE inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The development of angioedema following therapy with ARBs is surprising since these drugs are not thought to affect kinin metabolism directly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67838\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67838 \">figure 1</a>). The administration of ARBs to a patient with past ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is discussed elsewhere.
