The stage of a colon cancer has three components, primary tumor (T), status of the regional nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M), which together are combined to form stage groupings from I to IV. Stage groupings permit the stratification of prognosis, which is useful for the selection of treatment. The T, N, and M categories for colon cancer are assigned based upon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether there are signs of cancer spread on physical examination or radiographic imaging tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings from surgical resection and histologic examination of the resected tissues</p><p/><p>The current combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging for colorectal cancer (eighth edition, 2017) is illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>TNM staging for colorectal cancer is discussed in more detail elsewhere, and colon cancer prognosis, stratified according to stage, is discussed in more detail below.

An important point is that the finding of isolated liver or lung metastases on preoperative studies may not necessarily alter the surgical approach to the primary tumor, particularly in patients who are symptomatic from bleeding or impending obstruction.

It is generally preferable to obtain these scans prior to, rather than after, operation, as the scan results will occasionally change surgical planning.</p><p>Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver might identify more hepatic lesions than are visualized by CT and may be indicated to further define the extent of disease in patients who have suspected liver metastases on CT.

Serum CEA levels should be obtained preoperatively in patients with colon cancer, particularly as an aid to posttreatment follow-up. Elevated preoperative CEA levels that do not normalize following surgical resection can imply the presence of persistent disease and the need for further evaluation. Serum CEA should <strong>NOT</strong> be used as a screening test for colon cancer due to low sensitivity and specificity for early stage disease.

Colonoscopy serves to localize the tumor, provide a tissue diagnosis, characterize the lesion as mucosal or submucosal, and evaluate for the presence of extrinsic colonic compression, and synchronous carcinomas and adenomas. Synchronous invasive colorectal cancers are found in 3 to 5 percent of cases, while the prevalence of synchronous adenomas is as high as 30 percent.</p><p>If full colonoscopy cannot be performed prior to elective colon resection because of obstruction or poor preparation, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema, or (preferably) CT or magnetic resonance colonography can be used to evaluate the entire large bowel.

There is no consensus as to which patients, if any, are suitable for this approach. Furthermore, while concurrently administered chemotherapy provides synergistic antitumor activity, it also increases treatment-related toxicity, which may be prohibitive if the radiation treatment volume includes a substantial amount of bowel.</p><p>In our view, patients with potentially resectable disease should undergo multivisceral resection, rather than upfront chemoradiotherapy, if they are surgical candidates.

The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy have been most clearly demonstrated in patients with stage III (node-positive) disease, who have an approximately 30 percent reduction in the risk of disease recurrence and a 22 to 32 percent reduction in mortality with modern chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most treatments involve a combination of several chemotherapy drugs, which are given intravenously in a specific order on specific days. For patients with node-positive colon cancer, a course of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is generally recommended for most patients, although the benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> are controversial in older adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected colon cancer in elderly patients&quot;, section on 'Oxaliplatin-based regimens'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer#H4192015397\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Oxaliplatin-based therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal duration of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is evolving. Six months of therapy has been the standard approach, but the cumulative and dose-limiting neuropathy associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> has prompted interest in a shorter duration of therapy. Preliminary results from the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration (six randomized trials of six versus three months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy) reported at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggest that six months of therapy remains the standard of care for individuals with high-risk cancers (T4 or N2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. On the other hand, given the small predicted loss of absolute disease-free survival benefit (absolute difference 0.9 percent at three years) and the significantly lower rates of oxaliplatin neuropathy seen in the IDEA collaboration analysis, it seems reasonable to limit adjuvant therapy to three months in patients with low-risk disease (T1-3,N1), which makes up approximately 60 percent of all stage III colon cancers. These data are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer#H2668659669\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Oxaliplatin-based therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with resected node-negative (stage II) disease, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial, as is the relative benefit of an oxaliplatin-based as compared with a non-oxaliplatin-based regimen. Treatment decisions must be individualized. Expert guidelines suggest that the risks and estimated benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy be discussed with patients who have resected node-negative colon cancer. Among the issues that need to be taken into consideration when assessing the risk of recurrence and estimated benefit from specific chemotherapy regimens are the presence of high-risk clinicopathologic features (fewer than 12 nodes in the surgical specimen, T4 stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">perforated/obstructed</span> tumor, poorly differentiated histology, lymphovascular or perineural invasion), mismatch repair enzyme status, assessment of comorbidities and anticipated life expectancy, and given the relatively good prognosis of stage II disease, the potential risks associated with treatment. If adjuvant chemotherapy is chosen, most patients receive a fluoropyrimidine alone, unless they have a tumor with deficient mismatch repair status, in which case adjuvant fluoropyrimidines alone are ineffective. For patients receiving a non-oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy regimen (ie, a fluoropyrimidine alone), six months of adjuvant therapy remains the standard approach.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 90 percent risk of colorectal cancer by the age of 45 in the absence of prophylactic colectomy) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]; lifetime risk of colorectal cancer 25 to 75 percent) are the most common of the familial colorectal cancer syndromes, but together these two conditions account for fewer than 5 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors#H90629953\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;, section on 'Hereditary CRC syndromes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-adenomatous-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lynch syndrome is more common than FAP and accounts for approximately 2 to 3 percent of all colonic adenocarcinomas. The term &quot;Lynch syndrome&quot; is now commonly used for families who have been genetically determined to have a disease-causing defect (inherited or de novo) in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The biologic footprint of a defect in MMR capacity is microsatellite instability (MSI), detected by polymerase chain reaction. Testing of all colorectal cancers is routinely used to help establish the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Some institutions perform MSI testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing for MMR proteins (which are absent when a disease-causing genetic defect is present) in colorectal cancers in young patients (diagnosed prior to age 50 years) or in those who meet the Bethesda criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72965 \">table 3</a>). However, increasingly, universal testing of all colorectal cancers for MSI or loss of MMR proteins by IHC is performed, a practice that is supported by guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the United States Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of MSI and intact expression of all four MMR proteins on IHC rules out Lynch syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although over 90 percent of Lynch syndrome-related colorectal cancers will demonstrate MSI, 15 percent of sporadic colorectal cancers also have MSI.

If these proteins are not expressed in a tumor, the next step is analysis of <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation or analysis of methylation of the MLH1 promoter. The presence of a <em>BRAF </em>mutation suggests sporadic rather than inherited disease, and there is no need to refer for genetic testing. If there is methylation of the MLH1 promoter and no <em>BRAF </em>mutation, then a disease-causing genetic defect should be considered, as 5 to 10 percent of these patients may harbor a germline mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>On the other hand, loss of expression of MSH2 alone, MSH2 in combination with MSH6, or MSH6 alone is highly specific for a disease-causing germline defect, and referral for genetic testing (for the genes corresponding to the absent proteins) is appropriate.

While guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (<a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2507\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>) recommend six months of adjuvant chemotherapy after resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases, they do not address the utility of chemotherapy after resection of a local recurrence. The decision must be individualized and is based in part on whether adjuvant therapy (particularly an oxaliplatin-containing regimen) was administered previously.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) eighth edition tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging for colorectal cancer is illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17948751\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretreatment clinical staging is best accomplished by physical examination and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Serum levels of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) should be obtained preoperatively in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H17949425\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17949195\" class=\"local\">'Tumor markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideally, each patient should have a colonoscopic examination of the entire colon prior to surgery. If full colonoscopy cannot be performed because of obstruction or poor preparation, CT or magnetic resonance colonography can be done, or alternatively, the entire residual colon should be examined colonoscopically soon after resection. (See <a href=\"#H17949202\" class=\"local\">'Colonoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of colorectal and other extracolonic cancers should be sought prior to therapy, as an inherited predisposition to colon cancer may alter the surgical approach, prompting consideration of subtotal or total colectomy in high-risk individuals. (See <a href=\"#H17949245\" class=\"local\">'Family history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection is the only curative modality for localized colon cancer. Endoscopic resection is a reasonable alternative to radical surgery for selected early stage colon cancers arising in a polyp, as long as they meet certain criteria for favorable risk. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17949127\" class=\"local\">'Management of carcinoma in a polyp'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have undergone potentially curative resection of a colon cancer, postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy eradicates micrometastases, reduces the likelihood of disease recurrence, and increases cure rates. The benefits have been most clearly demonstrated in patients with stage III (node-positive) disease. In this setting, a six-month course of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is generally recommended. The benefit of chemotherapy for resected stage II disease is controversial, and treatment decisions must be individualized. (See <a href=\"#H17949571\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy carries a risk of significant toxicities, including mucositis, emesis, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, hair loss, hand-foot syndrome, and cardiotoxicity. The frequency and severity of these side effects vary according to the specific drugs used and how they are administered. Fortunately, most are reversible when chemotherapy is discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H17950071\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients who present with metastatic disease are not surgical candidates, and palliative chemotherapy is generally recommended. However, surgery may provide a potentially curative option for selected patients with limited metastatic disease, predominantly in the liver and lung. An aggressive surgical approach to both the primary and the metastatic sites is warranted in such patients in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy. For patients with unresectable distant metastases, the overwhelming majority of patients without symptoms who initiate chemotherapy never require palliative surgery. (See <a href=\"#H17948926\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important indicator of outcome following resection of colon cancer is pathologic stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81414\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81414 \">figure 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above). Following treatment for a stage II or III colon cancer, posttreatment surveillance usually consists of periodic history and physical examination and assay of the serum CEA, annual surveillance CT scans, and periodic colonoscopy. Recommendations for posttreatment surveillance from a number of expert groups are compared and contrasted in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following treatment for stage I colorectal cancer, posttreatment surveillance consists only of periodic history and physical examination and colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H17950079\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regularly updating a three-generation family history pedigree from cancer survivors can be valuable to help determine the potential risk of cancer in family members, as well as the survivor's own risk of subsequent cancers that may be associated with a previously unrecognized hereditary syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H17950156\" class=\"local\">'Genetic issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selected patients with locally recurrent colon cancer can be cured, typically with multimodality therapy.
