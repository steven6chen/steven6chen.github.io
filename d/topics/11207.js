(A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks.) The uterus, also called the &quot;womb,&quot; is the part of a woman's body where a baby grows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). A &quot;fetus&quot; is what a baby is called while it is growing inside you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564846691\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different problems can cause miscarriage. It can happen when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetus begins to develop but then stops growing, often because it has genetic problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother has certain medical problems, such as poorly controlled diabetes, or problems with the shape of her uterus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564846698\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are bleeding from the vagina and belly pain or cramping. See your doctor or nurse right away if you are pregnant and have these symptoms. If you are not sure if you are pregnant, take a urine pregnancy test to be sure.</p><p>You should also see your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever of 100&deg;F (37.8&deg;C) or higher</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anything solid comes out of your vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thick fluid that smells bad comes out of your vagina</p><p/><p>If you cannot get in touch with your doctor or nurse, or if you have heavy bleeding (soaking a sanitary pad in 1 to 2 hours), go to the emergency room.</p><p>These symptoms do not always mean that you are having a miscarriage. Your doctor can help figure out if anything is wrong.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564846705\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might be able to tell if you have had a miscarriage just by asking you questions and doing a pelvic exam. He or she might also look at your uterus using an ultrasound, a machine that uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of your body. That way, the doctor can look at the fetus and check whether it has a heartbeat. If your fetus has a heartbeat, you have not had a miscarriage. Your doctor can tell you if you are likely to have one. You might also need a blood test and then another blood test several days later to check on your pregnancy.</p><p>If you have a negative blood type (such as &quot;O negative&quot;), you might need a special injection to help prevent problems in future pregnancies. If you don't know your blood type, ask your doctor or nurse to check it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564846712\"><span class=\"h1\">How is miscarriage treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You cannot stop a miscarriage that has already started. If you have had a miscarriage, the fetus and the extra fluid in your uterus need to leave your body. Your doctor might want you just to wait and let it exit through your vagina by itself. If this is not an option, your doctor might treat you with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine to help your uterus get rid of what was inside it, or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the contents of your uterus leftover from pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564846719\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I prevent a miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no way to make sure that you will not have a miscarriage. But you can reduce your chances of having one by avoiding cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, and injury to your belly. Having a fever or some kinds of infections puts you at risk for miscarriage, so you should also talk to your doctor about how to avoid getting some kinds of infection.</p><p>Some of the invasive tests women have to check on the fetus during pregnancy can &ndash; in rare cases &ndash; cause miscarriage. If your doctor suggests testing your fetus, ask whether the test could cause a miscarriage. Also, some medicines or other treatments can be harmful to a fetus. Before you take any medicine (herbal, over-the-counter, or prescription) or have a medical treatment or X-ray, ask your doctor or nurse whether it could hurt your fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564846726\"><span class=\"h1\">What do I do after a miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you have had a miscarriage, you should not have sex or put anything in your vagina for 2 weeks. Ask your doctor when you can start using birth control again after having a miscarriage.</p><p>It is normal to feel sad or anxious after you have a miscarriage. But some women become truly depressed. If you think you might be depressed, mention it to your doctor. There are treatments and coping strategies that can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564846733\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I be able to have a normal pregnancy after a miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Most women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy pregnancies. Still, women who have had a miscarriage are more likely than those who have not to have other miscarriages.</p><p>Your doctor will tell you if you should wait before trying to get pregnant again. In most cases, it's safe to start trying again as soon as you feel ready. If you have 3 or more miscarriages, your doctor might want to run some tests to try to figure out the reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564846740\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=threatened-miscarriage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Threatened miscarriage (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=repeated-miscarriage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Repeated miscarriage (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Miscarriage (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
