In the United States, 35 percent of cases from 2003 to 2007 were in men aged 65 to 74, and another 25 percent were in men 75 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prostate cancer incidence rates rapidly rise with increasing age starting around age 50 years, with the highest rates seen in those aged 70 to 80 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50706 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, the estimated prevalence for men aged 75 years or greater is over one million men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostate cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death among men aged 80 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although the case-fatality rate of prostate cancer is quite low, deaths occur disproportionately in the elderly, owing to the long natural history of the disease. Thus, 41 percent of men who die of prostate cancer are between age 75 and 84 years and 30 percent are 85 years or older.</p><p/><p>Recommendations for the management of prostate cancer in the elderly are particularly difficult because of issues specific to this group and because clinical trials in prostate cancer often excluded elderly patients.</p><p>The initial treatment for elderly men with prostate cancer and the management of advanced disease will be reviewed here.

This assessment incorporates eight different parameters, including food intake, weight change, mobility, neuropsychological issues, body mass index, use of other medications, the patient's self-assessment of his health status, and age. Based upon this initial assessment, patients are divided into those deemed &quot;fit&quot; and those considered to have significant impairment.</p><p>For patients with impairment on the G8 health assessment, the second step is an assessment of comorbidity, dependence status, and nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidity &ndash; An evaluation of an individual's comorbidities (ie, Cumulative Illness Score Rating-Geriatrics [CISR-G]) is used to determine whether the impairment is reversible or irreversible.

The IADL scale can be modified further, as the SIOG recognized that all eight categories of the IADL scale may not be appropriate for a male population and thus allows for only four items to be used in the screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Financial management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medication management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use of transportation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use of the telephone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional status &ndash; An individual's nutritional status can be estimated by determining weight loss over the preceding three months:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Good nutritional status: &lt;5 percent of weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Risk of malnutrition: weight loss 5 to 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe malnutrition: weight loss &gt;10 percent</p><p/><p>Based upon this information, a patient can be categorized into one of three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fit &ndash; These patients are candidates for standard treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulnerable with a reversible impairment &ndash; No neuropsychological problems and any one of the following: grade 2 comorbidities; one uncontrolled grade 3 comorbidity which can be reversed, one or two ADL impairments; or risk of malnutrition reversible through geriatric intervention Following appropriate geriatric intervention, these patients should receive standard treatment for their prostate cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frail with irreversible impairment &ndash; Patients have irreversible impairment if they have one or more of the following: several grade 3 comorbidities or grade 4 comorbidity, more than two ADL abnormalities characterizing irreversible dependence, severe malnutrition, or neuropsychological problems.

Vulnerable or frail patients (based on G8 evaluation) should have consideration of undergoing a comprehensive geriatric assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A comprehensive geriatric assessment is also recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for senior adult oncology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'Use of CGA results'</a>.) </p><p>A related issue, both for issues of screening and management of patients in whom prostate cancer has been diagnosed, is that clinicians have only limited ability to predict life expectancy in men with localized prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Because life tables do not consider factors other than an individual's chronologic age, they do not accurately predict survival in men with multiple comorbidities. In a study of men with prostate cancer, life expectancy tables overestimated survival by 32 percent in those men with a Charlson Comorbidity Index of &ge;3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72047 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nomograms are available to predict 10-year life expectancy in men with localized prostate cancer that may be more accurate than life tables because they take into account comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Other standard options include observation, either as active surveillance (ie, careful monitoring with PSA, rectal exams, and periodic biopsies with potentially curative treatment on progression) or watch and wait (observation until the patient becomes symptomatically progressive before treatment is instituted). Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is also used, although it is discouraged in men with lower risk disease as primary therapy, owing to an increase in all-cause mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer#H834295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Androgen deprivation therapy alone'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-regionally-localized-intermediate-high-and-very-high-risk-prostate-cancer#H21650475\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Benefit of definitive treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Several publications have reported on the treatment options actually used for elderly men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Data from CaPSURE indicate that, for men over the age of 75 years, the use of ADT is declining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For those with low-risk disease, the proportion having surveillance is 76 percent, and primary ADT declined from approximately 30 percent in 2000 to 2004 to &lt;5 percent. For those with high-risk disease over the age of 75 years in the CaPSURE database, primary ADT remains the most common treatment, utilized in 67 percent of men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258749388\"><span class=\"h2\">Life expectancy and impact of disease on survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment decisions for men who present with localized prostate cancer need to consider both the life expectancy of the patient independent of his prostate cancer and the natural history of the prostate cancer. Data on the natural history of untreated prostate cancer indicate that although there are more deaths due to competing risks in men over the age of 70 years, especially in those with lower grade disease, a significant number of men over the age of 70 at diagnosis will eventually die of prostate cancer. The decision of whether or not to proceed with aggressive therapy for localized disease thus should incorporate not only the patient's age, but also the presence or absence of significant comorbidity, as well as the aggressiveness of the prostate cancer, as estimated by risk stratification.</p><p>Two large studies illustrate the relationships between age, comorbidity, and the natural history of prostate cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare database analyzed the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in 31,137 men &ge;65 years old diagnosed with T1-T2 screen disease between 1992 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. All men were initially managed conservatively, without either definitive therapy (surgery, radiation, cryotherapy) or ADT within six months of the original diagnosis. For men with Gleason 5 to 7 disease, the 15-year PCSM rates for men ages 65 to 74 and those &ge;75 years were 5.7 and 10 percent, respectively. For those with Gleason 8 to 10, the 15-year PCSM rates were 22 and 27 percent, respectively. However, 24 and 38 percent of men, respectively, ultimately received ADT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from the SEER database analyzed outcomes in 3183 men who were included in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (PCOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These men were diagnosed with localized disease between 1994 and 1995 and were followed for 14 years. Subjects were assessed for the presence of 12 major comorbidities at presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89481 \">table 4</a>). Outcomes were assessed as a function of age (&le;55, 56 to 65, 66 to 75, or &ge;76 years), number of comorbidities at presentation (0, 1, 2, or &ge;3), tumor risk category (low, intermediate, or high), and treatment (aggressive [surgery, RT] versus non aggressive [ADT] alone, watchful waiting]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At 14-year follow-up, the cumulative mortality rates from all causes other than prostate cancer were 24, 33, 46, and 57 percent for men with 0, 1, 2, or &ge;3 comorbidities. In contrast, the rates of prostate cancer mortality at this same time point were 3, 7, and 18 percent for men with low, intermediate, or high-risk disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89482\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89482 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of prostate cancer mortality was further analyzed based upon whether patients were initially managed with aggressive treatment (surgery, RT) or other approaches (watchful waiting, ADT). Men with no or only one comorbidity treated with ADT or watchful waiting had a statistically significant increase in risk of prostate cancer mortality compared with those treated aggressively (hazard ratios [HRs] 2.4 and 2.2, respectively). The risks for those with two or three comorbidities managed conservatively were not statistically significant (HRs 1.6 and 1.5, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258749381\"><span class=\"h2\">Organizational guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several groups have developed formal prostate cancer guidelines for elderly men.</p><p>The most extensive recommendations are those of the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG), which provide a decision tree for managing men with localized prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The SIOG recommendations take into consideration the aggressiveness of the prostate cancer (using D'Amico risk stratification) in the decision tree:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy &ndash; Same treatment approach as for younger patients for all localized prostate cancer risk categories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulnerable with a reversible problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High-risk localized prostate cancer: Same treatment as for younger patients, with appropriate management of underlying problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer: Active surveillance or watchful waiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frail with a non-reversible problem &ndash; Prostate cancer screening is not recommended for this population. Men in this category who are diagnosed with prostate cancer should receive palliative care only.</p><p/><p>The European Association of Urology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for senior adult oncology both similarly support the use of a comprehensive geriatric assessment with similar recommendations that health state rather than age should be a the determinant of treatment option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H695146377\"><span class=\"h2\">Radical prostatectomy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13014038\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessing the effectiveness of radical prostatectomy in elderly men with localized prostate cancer is difficult.

The survival advantage was seen only in those under age 65 years in subset analyses; however, those between age 65 and 75 years had a significantly lower rate of distant metastases and lower use of ADT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H167060109\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Survival impact of radical prostatectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Observational data do support a role for radical prostatectomy in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-27</a>]. As an example, in a study of 4500 men undergoing surgery, 17 percent of whom were older than 70 years, higher grade and higher stage disease was seen in those aged 70 or greater compared with younger cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although unadjusted disease-specific survival was worse in those aged &ge;70 years, age was not a significant predictor of survival on multivariate analysis that incorporated stage and grade. This is similar to other series that found worse pathological characteristics at radical prostatectomy from older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], but similar or better disease-specific survival compared with younger cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In another series of 386 men over the age of 70 years, the 15-year prostate cancer-specific and overall survival rates were 90 and 69 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This is better than a population-based cohort of men over the age of 70 in which the 10-year overall survival for men undergoing radical prostatectomy was 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A predictive model that included an individual's comorbidities was developed to improve the accuracy of predicting overall mortality in men with prostate cancer undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This model incorporates Gleason grade, serum PSA, and Charlson comorbidity index (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72047 \">table 3</a>) to illustrate the impact of the degree of comorbidity on overall survival in men over the age of 70 years who undergo radical prostatectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74222\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74222 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H695146384\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the biggest concerns of radical prostatectomy in elderly men is the higher rate of complications compared with younger persons, particularly related to urinary and sexual function. As an example, in one large series, the rate of complications increased progressively with age (4, 7, 9, and 14 percent for ages 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and &ge;70 years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In a population-based study, frequent urinary leakage was significantly less common at two years postoperatively in men less than 74 years of age compared with those 75 to 79 years (5 to 10 percent versus 27 percent, p = 0.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Similarly, potency rates were lower in men 75 to 79 years compared with those under age 60 years (19 versus 39 percent). This population-based study also collected data on men treated conservatively. Compared with those treated surgically or with RT, those treated conservatively had less urinary and bowel issues at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Older men may require secondary interventions more frequently following radical prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
