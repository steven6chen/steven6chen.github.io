A normal backbone, also called the &quot;spine,&quot; has a slight curve. In a child with kyphosis, the upper part of the spine curves more than normal, causing a rounded or hunched back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83509\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83509 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678357\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes kyphosis in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kyphosis in children is caused by problems with the vertebrae. Vertebrae are the bones of the spine that sit on top of one another like a stack of coins. The main types of kyphosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital kyphosis &ndash; In this condition, a baby is born with kyphosis. This happens because of a problem with the vertebrae that happens before birth. &quot;Congenital&quot; means a condition a person is born with.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postural kyphosis &ndash; This problem happens if a child does not stand up straight or slouches. It is more common in teenage girls than in younger girls or boys of any age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scheuermann kyphosis &ndash; In this condition, some vertebrae in the upper spine are shaped like a wedge instead of a rectangle. This causes the upper part of the spine to curve.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678374\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of kyphosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is a hunched or rounded back that might hurt or feel stiff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678389\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child has kyphosis by doing an exam. But he or she might order a back X-ray and other tests. These tests will allow the doctor or nurse to see the bones of the spine and measure the curve of the back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110678404\"><span class=\"h1\">How is kyphosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on what caused the problem and how serious it is.</p><p>Children with congenital kyphosis often need surgery to fix the vertebrae problems.</p><p>Children with postural kyphosis often do not need treatment. Exercises to stretch and strengthen the back can help, but children often do not do the exercises as directed.</p><p>Children with Scheuermann kyphosis can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do exercises to stretch and strengthen the back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid activities that cause pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines to ease pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a back brace</p><p/><p>If they continue to have pain or have severe kyphosis, children with Scheuermann kyphosis sometimes need surgery.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
