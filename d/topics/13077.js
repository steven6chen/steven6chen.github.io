These reactions are a form of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity. The causative allergens in these plant foods are homologous to pollen allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The disorder is also called &quot;pollen-food syndrome&quot; and &quot;pollen-associated food allergy syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is a term used variably as a synonym of PFS or to describe just the isolated oropharyngeal symptoms caused by pollen-related foods. In this review, OAS is applied to isolated oropharyngeal symptoms.</p><p>The symptoms of OAS result from contact urticaria of the oropharynx. Symptoms are usually limited to the mouth and throat and only observed with raw forms of the food because the causative allergens are rapidly inactivated by digestion and cooking, although this is not uniformly true. Systemic reactions as well as reactions to cooked foods are observed in a small proportion of patients.</p><p>This topic review will present the pathogenesis of PFS. The clinical manifestations, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of PFS are presented elsewhere.

This structural and functional homology underlies the extensive cross-reactivity observed clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5003846\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensitization to pollen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensitization to inhaled pollen proteins via the respiratory tract is believed to be the initial pathogenic event. The pollen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) generated by this mechanism then binds to the surface of mast cells and basophils throughout the body, including those in the oropharyngeal mucosa. Upon oral contact with a related food, these IgE molecules recognize homologous conformational epitopes on proteins in the food, triggering localized release of inflammatory mediators and the symptoms of OAS. In most cases, the allergens are subsequently destroyed in the stomach, limiting any further reaction.</p><p>In support of the inciting role of pollen, studies suggest that oropharyngeal reactions caused by foods that are related to birch pollen (such as apple) are more prevalent in areas where birch trees are common, such as central and northern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, in birch-free Spain, allergy to apple presents differently. It is more often associated with systemic reactions (in &gt;35 percent of patients) and has been attributed to different allergens, suggesting a distinct pathogenic mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Dendritic cells from birch pollen-allergic donors, when exposed to Bet v 1 in vitro, induced allergen-specific T cell proliferation and T helper type 2 (Th2) polarization (interleukin-5 [IL-5], interleukin-13 [IL-13]). In contrast, exposure to celery Api g 1 significantly enhanced the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and downregulated IL-13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLERGENS IN PFS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The conformational B cell epitopes on proteins implicated in OAS and PFS are sensitive to heat, acid, and digestive enzymes and therefore usually cause reactions limited to the oropharynx.

In plane pollen-allergic adults with peach allergy, the nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP), Pla a 3, was shown to be a major allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Much less is known about the allergens responsible for PFS in grass- and weed-allergic patients, compared with those in tree pollen-allergic patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Birch pollen-related allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary allergens causing PFS in birch-sensitized patients are Bet v 1 cross-reactive antigens and profilins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Bet v 1 cross-reactive antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bet v 1 is a major allergenic protein in birch tree (<em>Betula verrucosa</em>) pollen. Bet v 1 belongs to the family of the pathogenesis-related protein 10 (PRP-10), which is important to plant defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Most PFS in birch-allergic individuals is caused by proteins that cross-react with Bet v 1, including those in Rosacea fruits (apple, cherry, apricot, pear, plum) and Apiaceae vegetables (eg, celery, carrot) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60787 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Bet v 1 homologs include Mal d 1 (in apple), Pru av 1 (in cherry), Pru ar 1 (in apricot), Pyr c 1 (in pear), Pru p 1 (in peach), Api g 1 (in celery), and Dau c 1 (in carrot).</p><p>Bet v 1 type allergenic epitopes are conformational in nature and depend on the intact tertiary protein folding. They are highly susceptible to heating and digestion and undergo prompt disintegration in the stomach. Such treatments destroy the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding capacity of these allergens, although the ability to activate allergen-specific T cells persists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In some adults with atopic dermatitis and birch pollen allergy, ingestion of cooked birch pollen-related foods results in worsening of eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One could speculate that similar effects might occur in other conditions with T cell-mediated mechanisms, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, allergic rhinitis, or asthma. In addition, ingestion of cooked birch-pollen cross-reactive foods might drive perennially increased allergen-specific IgE levels in patients suffering from seasonal allergic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Profilins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first profilin identified was an allergen in birch pollen that was named Bet v 2.

IgE of birch pollen food-allergic individuals cross-reacts with Bet v 2 homologous proteins from apple, pear, melon, carrot, celery, potato, and mugwort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60787 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. Sensitization to profilins can be found in 10 to 30 percent of pollen-allergic patients and most likely occurs via respiratory tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLERGENS IN ISOLATED FRUIT/VEGETABLE ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When fruit or vegetable allergy develops <strong>in the absence</strong> of pollen allergy, patients may be sensitized to nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. In general, sensitization to nsLTPs is associated with higher rates of systemic reactions and with food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For patients in the Mediterranean region, nsLTP in peanut (Ara h 9) and in walnut (Jug r 3) have been identified as relevant allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactions to plant foods in patients sensitized to nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are more likely to be severe and systemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The nsLTPs belong to the prolamin superfamily of plant proteins and are members of pathogenesis-related protein 14 (PRP-14). They have antifungal and antibacterial properties, and they are involved in plant defense and are abundant in the peel of plant foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, nsLTPs have been found to be major allergens in various foods (eg, peach Pru p 3, cherry Pru av 3, apple Mal d 3, hazelnut Cor a 8, orange Cit s 3, strawberry Fra a 3) and in pollen.</p><p>These proteins are highly cross-reactive due to extensive sequence homology and are panallergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Panallergens are structurally homologous and phylogenetically conserved allergenic proteins that are frequently responsible for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated polysensitization and false-positive test results in subjects without clinical reactivity.</p><p>nsLTPs are remarkably heat-stable, presumably due to four alpha-helices stabilized by four disulfide bonds. nsLTPs retain their allergenicity in processed foods, such as sterilized peach juice, cooked apple, beer, and fermented products, such as wine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. nsLTPs are also resistant to digestive enzymes (pepsin, trypsin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Sensitization to nsLTPs is prevalent in the Mediterranean areas (eg, Spain and southern Italy, where birch trees do not grow) and uncommon in central and northern Europe (where birches are common) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. In China, mugwort pollen nsLTP (Art v 3) has been reported as a primary sensitizer in patients with peach allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>It is assumed that nsLTPs may sensitize both by inhalation and ingestion. In fact, nsLTPs are a minor allergen in subjects with plane-pollen allergy without food allergy and a major allergen in subjects with reported food allergy to peach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Sensitization via the gastrointestinal route may be more important in this type of allergy, considering the prevalence of this disorder in areas lacking birch trees. When T cells were purified from peripheral blood and stimulated with natural peach nsLTP Pru p 3, they produced mainly T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines and very little interleukin-10 (IL-10), unlike T cells specific for other plant food and pollen allergens. The expression of gut homing integrin beta-7 on Pru p 3-specific T cells was comparable with that observed on peanut-specific T cells and higher than that seen in different pollen-specific T cells, suggesting a gastrointestinal route of sensitization to nsLTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLERGENS IN SPECIFIC FOODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific allergens have been identified in some plant foods that are associated with either oropharyngeal or systemic reactions. However, there is no reliable way to discern which allergen an individual is sensitized to outside of research settings. While the commercially available allergen microarray ImmunoCAP ISAC detects several major fruit and vegetable allergens, predominantly Bet v 1 cross-reactive, the component immunoglobulin E (IgE) profiling does not seem to enhance the diagnostic accuracy in PFS, suggesting that additional allergens may be relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This information is presented to help clinicians understand the known associations between pollens and foods and to be aware of the foods that have been implicated in systemic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Apple</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The apple allergen Mal d 1, a common cause of OAS, is a Bet v 1 homolog that shares 64 percent amino acid sequence similarity and common IgE epitopes with Bet v 1. A study utilized Bet v 1-Mal d 1 chimeric protein and showed that birch-allergic adults with PFS to apple had significantly higher IgE reactivity to the Mal d 1 regions grafted on Bet v 1 than birch-allergic adults without PFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This suggests that different B cell epitopes may be important for the expression of PFS to apple. Mal d 1 is highly unstable and can be disrupted by heating, processing, and digestion. In contrast, the nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) Mal d 3 is highly resistant to heating and retains the ability to bind IgE following heating at 90&ordm;C (194&ordm;F) for 20 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/37,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,46</a>].</p><p>Multiple reports documented that in the areas where birch trees are common, such as in central and northern Europe (Netherlands, Austria, northern Italy), allergic symptoms to apple are usually mild (&gt;90 percent report oral symptoms) and associated with birch pollen allergy and sensitization to Mal d 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/9,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,47</a>]. In rare patients with anaphylactic reactions to apple, no IgE to nsLTP has been detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In contrast, in birch-free southern Europe (Spain), allergy to apple is more often severe (&gt;35 percent report systemic reactions) and associated with peach allergy and sensitization to the nsLTP Mal d 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The content of these allergens in individual apples is highly variable and affected by the specific cultivar, ripeness at the time of harvesting, and duration and conditions of storage. Both Mal d 1 and Mal d 3 are expressed throughout fruit development, and their levels increase with ripening. Certain apple cultivars were reported to contain less Mal d 1, such as Santana, Braeburn, Pinova, or Elise compared with high Mal d 1 content in Golden Delicious and Jonagold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. These differences were confirmed with prick skin testing and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) for Santana and Golden Delicious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Mal d 1 content was shown to increase during storage at 2&ordm;C (35.6&ordm;F) and was higher in stored apples than in freshly picked apples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hazelnut</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hazelnut contains allergens homologous to Cor a 1 and Bet v 1, the major allergens in hazel and birch tree pollens respectively, as well as profilins, Cor a 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Other allergens, including the lipid transfer protein, Cor a 8, 11S seed storage globulin (legumin-like), Cor a 9, and 2S albumin, Cor a 14 may be responsible for systemic reactions to hazelnut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>].

In a series of 20 adult patients with birch pollen and peanut allergy who underwent DBPCFC to lightly roasted peanut flour, 60 percent developed only OAS, whereas 40 percent had additional systemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against the peanut allergen Ara h 8, homologous with birch Bet v 1, were detected in sera from 85 percent of subjects. Ara h 8 is also homologous to Api g 1 (celery), Gly m 4 (soy), and Pru av 1 (cherry) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Ara h 8 was partially disrupted by roasting and completely destroyed by gastric enzymes. These data suggest that peanuts may cause OAS in a subset of birch pollen-allergic individuals. However, clinicians should be aware that the majority of peanut- and tree nut-allergic individuals react to non-pollen-related stable proteins that result in more systemic and severe reactions. Thus, diagnosis of PFS in subjects with peanut- and or tree nut-induced oral symptoms should be made cautiously. We usually consider patients with peanut or tree nut allergy, even if symptoms have been limited to the oropharynx, to be at risk for more severe reactions and manage them accordingly (ie, prescribe self-injectable epinephrine and provide appropriate counseling).

The causative allergens in these plant foods are homologous to pollen allergens. The term &quot;oral allergy syndrome&quot; (OAS) is used in this review to describe PFS reactions that are limited to the oropharynx. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenic mechanism begins in the respiratory tract with sensitization to inhaled pollens. Symptoms then result from oral contact with plant foods containing homologous allergens. In most cases, although not all, the allergens are subsequently destroyed in the stomach, limiting any further reaction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The allergens implicated in OAS and PFS are sensitive to heat, acid, and digestive enzymes. The primary allergens causing PFS in birch-sensitized patients are Bet v 1 cross-reactive antigens and profilins. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Allergens in PFS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to the allergens that cause PFS, the allergens responsible for isolated food allergy (in the absence of pollen sensitization) are typically resistant to both heat and digestion and therefore have a greater potential to cause systemic symptoms. Sensitization is believed to occur through the gastrointestinal tract. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Allergens in isolated fruit/vegetable allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific allergens have been identified in some plant foods, which are associated with either oropharyngeal or systemic reactions. However, there is no way to discern which allergen an individual is sensitized to, outside of research settings.
