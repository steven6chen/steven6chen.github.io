It is a way for people to figure out how many &quot;carbs&quot; they eat. &quot;Carbs&quot; is short for &quot;carbohydrates.&quot;</p><p>Our body breaks down the food we eat into 3 main types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates are sugars and starches that come from food. The body uses carbohydrates for energy.</p><p>People with diabetes need to watch how many carbs they eat, because carbs raise a person's blood sugar level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5547193\"><span class=\"h1\">Which foods have carbs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foods with a lot of carbs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bread, pasta, rice, and cereal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fruits and starchy vegetables</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk and other dairy foods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods with added sugar (such as many cookies and cakes)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5547207\"><span class=\"h1\">How is carb counting helpful?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carb counting helps you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose the right amount of insulin to give your child before meals and snacks &ndash; The insulin dose depends on different factors, including what your child eats (especially the amount of carbohydrates) and how much he or she exercises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plan your child's meals and snacks for the day &ndash; You can use carb counting to figure out how many carbs your child should eat at each meal and snack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your child's blood sugar level under control &ndash; Spreading out the carbs your child eats over a whole day can help keep his or her blood sugar from getting too low or too high. Eating about the same amount of carbs every day also helps. This can help control your child's diabetes better and prevent medical problems that diabetes can cause.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5547222\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I count carbs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To count carbs, you need to look at the food's nutrition label (if it has a nutrition label). You will need to look at the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Total carbohydrate&quot; number &ndash; This tells you how many carbs are in 1 serving size of the food. If your child eats 1 serving, then the number of carbs your child eats will be the same as this number.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Serving size&quot; &ndash; This tells you how much food is in 1 serving. If your child has 2 servings, the number of carbs will be 2 times the number of carbohydrates listed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Dietary fiber&quot; &ndash; Fiber is a carbohydrate that is not digested and so does not raise blood sugar. Foods with a lot of fiber can help control your child's blood sugar. If a food has more than 5 grams (g) of fiber, less insulin is needed for that food. So, you should count only the carbs that are not from fiber (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76576 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p/><p>If your child's food doesn't have a nutrition label, talk with your dietitian (food expert), diabetes nurse, or doctor. He or she can give you information about the usual serving sizes of different foods and the number of carbs in 1 serving size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5547237\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I plan my child's meals?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's dietitian will tell you how many carbs your child should eat in one day. It will depend on your child's age, size, and how active he or she is.</p><p>You can spread out the total number of carbs over your child's meals and snacks for the day. That way, your child can eat some carbs at each meal or snack. Writing down the number of carbs your child eats at each meal and snack can help you keep track of the total number.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5547252\"><span class=\"h1\">Does my child need special foods?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Your child can eat the same foods as your family. But, if possible, your family should eat a healthy diet with low-fat foods and lots of vegetables. It's best for your child to get carbs from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat milk and dairy products. Whole grains are found in foods such as whole wheat bread, whole grain cereals, and brown rice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5547267\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child is a picky eater?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child is a picky eater, try to be creative. Ask your dietitian, doctor, or nurse for ideas for new snacks. If your child refuses to eat at meal or snack time, give him or her milk or juice instead.</p><p>Your diabetes team can also tell you how to adjust the timing and amount of your child's insulin dose when his or her appetite changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5547284\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child eats food without telling me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child eats extra snacks, remind him or her that eating extra food can raise his or her blood sugar level and lead to serious problems. Your child should always let you know if he or she wants to eat extra food. That way, you can make sure he or she has the right amount of insulin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5547299\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetes and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diet and health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=checking-your-childs-blood-sugar-level-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Checking your child's blood sugar level (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=keeping-your-childs-blood-sugar-under-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Keeping your child's blood sugar under control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-diabetes-in-school-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing diabetes in school (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-abcs-of-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: The ABCs of diabetes (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-mellitus-and-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes mellitus and diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
