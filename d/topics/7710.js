Inherited bleeding disorders include abnormalities of coagulation factors as well as platelet function, the most common of which is von Willebrand disease. However, when the term &quot;hemophilia&quot; is used, it usually refers specifically to the following two disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) &ndash; Hemophilia A affects 1 in 5000 to 10,000 males; roughly 60 percent have severe disease, with factor VIII activity less than 1 percent of normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B) &ndash; Hemophilia B affects 1 in 25,000 to 30,000 males; approximately one-half have mild to moderate disease, with factor IX activity greater than 1 percent of normal.</p><p/><p>Severe factor VIII or factor IX deficiency leads to bleeding because of the role these factors play in the intrinsic pathway X-ase (ten-ase) complex. The X-ase complex consists of activated factor IX (factor IXa) as the protease; activated factor VIII (factor VIIIa), calcium, and phospholipids as the cofactors; and factor X as the substrate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These hemophilias occur almost exclusively in a male having one defective copy of the relevant gene on his X chromosome (ie, hemizygous for the disease-causing mutation [referred to as a &quot;pathogenic variant&quot;]). Because the affected male will transmit a normal Y chromosome to all his sons and an abnormal X chromosome to all his daughters, his sons will not be affected and all of his daughters will be carriers (ie, they are heterozygous for the pathogenic variant).</p><p>Although female carriers have one normal allele, they may experience bleeding symptoms similar to those seen in a patient with &quot;mild&quot; deficiency. Therefore, their care and symptoms should be carefully evaluated. For carriers, with each birth there is a 50 percent chance to transmit the disorder to male infants and a 50 percent chance for female infants to be a carrier.</p><p>Rarely, women have more symptomatic hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Possible explanations include inheritance of mutations from parents who include an affected male and a female carrier, in which case each female child has a 50 percent chance of being affected. Alternatively, loss of part or all of the normal X chromosome (as in Turner syndrome) or skewed inactivation of the normal X chromosome may lead to symptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p>Approximately one-third of patients with hemophilia do not have a family history of the disease and appear to represent novel mutational events, although somatic mosaicism in a parent or grandparent may explain some of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Germline mosaicism is also known to occur in families with hemophilia A and B. This occurs when the mother of an individual with hemophilia is tested and not found to be a carrier of the disease-causing variant in her somatic cells; however, she may have a second affected son or a daughter who is a carrier because she is mosaic for the pathogenic variant within her germline. Mothers without a family history of hemophilia who have negative carrier testing have an approximately 5 percent residual risk of having a second child with hemophilia or a daughter who is a carrier due to maternal germline mosaicism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTOR VIII (F8) GENE/HEMOPHILIA A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gene encoding factor VIII (F8) is large, comprising approximately 0.1 percent of the X chromosome. The F8 gene is divided into 26 exons that span 186,000 base pairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. The protein contains several areas of internal homology, consisting of a heavy chain with A1 and A2 domains; a connecting region with a B domain; and a light chain with A3, C1, and C2 domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Protein functions are domain-specific. For example, different epitopes on the C2 domain are responsible for binding to the procoagulant phospholipid phosphatidylserine on activated platelets and endothelial cells, von Willebrand factor (which importantly slows the catabolism of factor VIII), factor Xa, and thrombin. Two domains contribute to the binding of factor IXa (A2 domain and the <span class=\"nowrap\">A1/A3-C1-C2</span> dimer). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of factor VIII and factor IX&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination of hemophilia A genes has not demonstrated a uniform F8 abnormality. Instead, numerous different variants in the F8 gene have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. The large size of the F8 gene and the presence of &quot;hotspots&quot; within the gene are thought to increase the likelihood of mutations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 200 affected genes, seven different mutations were demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Four of them were transpositions of single bases, of which three transformed a codon for arginine into a stop codon, which arrested factor VIII synthesis and resulted in truncated factor VIII and severe hemophilia. The fourth mutation resulted in substitution of a single amino acid and mild hemophilia. The other three mutations involved deletion of several thousand nucleotides and produced severe hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly 70 percent of point mutations within the F8 gene occur at one of the 70 CpG sites, although these represent only 2 percent of the coding sequence. Approximately 25 percent of all small deletions observed occur at one of two series of eight or nine adenine nucleotides located within exon 14. These three hotspots account for two-thirds of the pathogenic variants in severe hemophilia A, not including those with an intron 22 inversion. The pathogenic variants responsible for causing hemophilia A include inversions, point mutations (missense and nonsense), small deletions and insertions, large deletions, and splice-site mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 40 to 45 percent of severe hemophilia A is caused by a major inversion of a section of the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome, one break point of which is situated within intron 22 of the F8 gene. A consortium study involving 22 laboratories from 14 countries evaluated 2093 patients with severe hemophilia A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of these, 740 patents (35 percent) had a type 1 (distal) F8 inversion and 140 (7 percent) showed a type 2 (proximal) inversion. This observation has had a major impact upon carrier detection. Subsequently, a second inversion in intron 1 was identified as a recurrent cause of severe factor VIII deficiency in approximately 4 to 5 percent of individuals with hemophilia A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The majority of genetic alterations that result in CRM-positive hemophilia A are missense mutations within the A2 domain of the F8 gene. The A2 subunit is essential for the activity of activated factor VIII, and in one study, several of these patients were found to have defective interaction with factor IXa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2017 study, F8 genotyping was performed on 2401 hemophilia A patients in the United States, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a variety of other methods used for variant confirmation and the detection of intronic inversions and larger structural variations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

This gene encodes a protein that may act as a molecular chaperone of these and other secreted proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The disease is associated with a moderate bleeding tendency, with plasma levels of 5 to 30 percent of normal for both factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;, section on 'Factor V and VIII combined deficiency (F5F8D)'</a>.)</p><p>In other kindreds, the combined deficiency is associated with mutations in a gene on chromosome 2 called multiple coagulation factor deficiency 2 gene (<em>MCFD2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. <em>MCFD2</em> encodes a protein that forms a Ca<sup>++</sup>-dependent stoichiometric complex with LMAN1 and acts as a cofactor in the intracellular trafficking of factors V and VIII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTOR IX (F9) GENE/HEMOPHILIA B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The F9 gene encoding factor IX is also located near the terminus of the long arm of the X chromosome. This 34 kb gene contains eight exons and seven introns; its protein product is one of the vitamin-K-dependent proteins. As such, it is the largest gene of vitamin-K-dependent coagulation factor family and the only one present on the X chromosome. The number of exons and splice junction types are highly conserved in homologous vitamin-K-dependent proteins.</p><p>Hemophilia B is a markedly heterogeneous disorder with a wide range of plasma levels of factor IX and a variety of specific gene variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The original factor-IX-deficient subject, Mr. Christmas, was a severely deficient patient who had an F9 mutation that resulted in a single amino acid change (C206S) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Most affected families show a unique mutation. Missense variants are most commonly identified in individuals, but multiple other variants have been reported, including deletions, duplications, insertions, splice-site variants, and nonsense variants. For example, one study of 70 unrelated patients with hemophilia B in the Rh&ocirc;ne Alpes in France found two complete gene deletions in patients with a factor IX inhibitor, six small <span class=\"nowrap\">insertions/deletions,</span> and 62 point mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Two of the nucleotide substitutions were detected in 21 patients (30 percent), suggesting the existence of a local founder effect; another 13 mutations were previously undescribed.</p><p>In a 2017 study, F9 genotyping was performed on 599 individuals with hemophilia B in the United States using next-generation sequencing (NGS), with a variety of other methods used for variant confirmation and the detection of intronic inversions and larger structural variations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The EAHAD F9 database includes 1113 variants, 73 percent of which are point mutations. Also present are insertions, deletions, and complex mutations.

However, absence of the FIX is not always associated with inhibitor formation, which has an incidence of approximately 3 percent.

A dozen different variants have been described, all point mutations, to cause hemophilia B Leyden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These promoter mutations disrupt the binding of transcription factors that increase factor IX expression after puberty. Thus, in individuals with the Leyden phenotype, factor IX levels increase following puberty, and these individuals often convert from a more severe to a milder clinical phenotype by adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Leyden phenotype mutations cluster in a region of the factor IX promoter that spans from nucleotide c.-50 to c.-18, known as the Leyden-specific region (LSR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Factor VIII (F8) gene/hemophilia A'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Factor IX (F9) gene/hemophilia B'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the affected male will transmit a normal Y chromosome to all his sons and an abnormal X chromosome to all his daughters, his sons will not be affected and all of his daughters will be heterozygous carriers. Some heterozygous females may have mild hemophilia. Rarely, females may have more symptomatic disease due to co-inheritance of mutations from an affected father and a carrier mother, from loss of part or all of the X chromosome, or from skewed lyonization (inactivation) of the X chromosome. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetic transmission'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H91042678\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Bleeding in females/carriers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A female carrier has a 50 percent chance of passing the bleeding disorder on to each of her sons and a 50 percent chance of passing carrier status on to each of her daughters. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetic transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-third of patients with hemophilia do not have a family history of the disease and appear to represent novel mutational events. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetic transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis and management of hemophilia are discussed in a number of separate topic reviews listed above.
