Only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a> has been approved for use in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ranolazine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ranolazine</a> was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 for management of chronic stable angina. Although initially thought to act by partial inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, it was later realized that ranolazine had that effect only at serum levels not achieved with the usual dosing.</p><p>A more important mechanism for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a> may be the prevention of both calcium overload and the subsequent increase in diastolic tension due to inhibition of late inward sodium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Since this sodium channel frequently fails to inactivate in a number of important myocardial disease states such as ischemia and hypertrophy, excess entry of sodium ions leads to activation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/calcium</span> exchanger, thereby raising calcium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Given the normal rapid inaction of the late inward sodium channel in normal myocytes, the drug does not exert a significant effect on the normal myocardium at usual dosages. This potentially increases its therapeutic window.</p><p>The initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a> is 500 mg twice daily.

The lack of such benefit was demonstrated in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial in which over 6000 patients with an acute coronary syndrome were randomly assigned to placebo or to ranolazine (initiated intravenously and followed by oral therapy of extended release 1000 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

After 12 weeks of therapy, both doses of ranolazine significantly increased symptom-limited exercise duration, time to onset of angina, and (at peak ranolazine blood level) time to ST segment depression, and reduced angina frequency by 0.8 and 1.2 episodes per week, compared to placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ERICA trial, 565 stable patients with more than three anginal attacks per week were randomly assigned to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a> (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The issue of whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a> might improve outcomes in such patients was evaluated in the RIVER-PCI trial, which randomly assigned 2651 patients to ranolazine or placebo after incomplete revascularization with PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of the primary efficacy end point (time to first occurrence of ischemia-driven revascularization or ischemia-driven hospitalization without revascularization) between the two groups (26 versus 28 percent; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.82-1.10) after a median follow-up of 643 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Unstable angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A different population was studied in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial cited above of patients with an acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. In the subset of 3565 patients who had prior chronic angina, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a> significantly reduced the primary end point of cardiovascular death, MI, and recurrent ischemia due entirely to a significant reduction in recurrent ischemia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The mechanism of this effect is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a> produces a dose-dependent increase in the QT interval, the United States Food and Drug Administration recommended that it should be reserved for patients who have not had an adequate response with other antianginal drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. We would be more restrictive, limiting the use of ranolazine to patients who have failed all other antianginal therapies. Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with preexisting QT interval prolongation or hepatic disease, and in patients taking other drugs that prolong the QT interval or that are potent or moderately potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>.

However, the effect is generally less than with other drugs (mean QTc prolongation 2.4 ms in a review of 746 patients treated for almost three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and torsade de pointes has not yet been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Most drugs that cause torsade de pointes show reverse use dependence, which is defined as the inverse correlation between the heart rate and QT interval.

Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation represents a different approach to the management of angina. Switching from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation increases cardiac metabolic efficiency. Three such agents are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a>, trimetazidine, and perhexiline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, ranolazine is discussed separately above because inhibition of fatty acid oxidation may not be its primary mode of action.</p><p>Although the heart uses both glucose and fatty acids as fuel, during periods of stress the heart uses more fatty acids, which is less oxygen efficient.

Compared to placebo, trimetazidine was associated with the following significant benefits: a reduction in weekly angina episodes (mean 1.44) and improved exercise time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Among four small trials that compared trimetazidine to other antianginal drugs, one favored trimetazidine over nitrates and three tended to favor other drugs.

Since ATP-dependent potassium channels play a role in ischemic preconditioning, nicorandil may also mimic a natural process of ischemic preconditioning, protecting the heart from subsequent ischemic attacks.
