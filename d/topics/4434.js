Three of these hillocks are derived from the first branchial arch (Meckel) and three from the second branchial arch (Reichert) during the fifth and sixth weeks of intrauterine life. Growth of the fused tissues, guided by the pull of the intrinsic muscles of the ear, creates the folds of the helix, antihelix, and tragus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80743\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80743 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The ear canal is formed from an invagination of surface epithelium in the fifth week of intrauterine life. This was thought to represent a vestige of the first branchial cleft; however, fate mapping studies and evidence from transgenic mice with the duplicated auricular structures suggest instead that it results from a distinct invagination within the first branchial arch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The solid core of cells meets a similar evagination from the pharynx, trapping a layer of mesothelium in between (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67764\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67764 \">figure 2</a>). Fusion of these cells at the juncture results in the formation of the three layers of the tympanic membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74065 \">figure 3</a>). Recanalization of the external ear canal occurs in the second trimester and is complete at approximately 28 weeks gestation; vernix-like material is left behind [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Middle ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ossicles are formed by condensation of mesenchyme derived from the first and second branchial arches. Cartilage develops and gradually is replaced by bone in the second and third trimesters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75999\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75999 \">picture 1</a>). The ossicles are near adult size and adult ossification at the time of birth. Cartilage remains only at the articulations.</p><p>The cavity of the middle ear forms when endoderm evaginating from the first pharyngeal pouch invades the mesoderm of the middle ear. This pouch narrows to form the lining of the eustachian tube near the nasopharynx and spawns fingerlike projections that surround the developing ossicles. The lateral-most projection of endoderm creates the inner layer of the tympanic membrane. Tympanic membrane retractions that cause cholesteatomas later in life follow the paths of these mucosal invaginations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholesteatoma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholesteatoma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At birth, the middle ear is narrow and contains residual mesenchyme and amniotic fluid. Within minutes of birth and spontaneous breathing, air enters the eustachian tube, displacing amniotic fluid to create a pneumatized cavity. Some mesenchyme persists beneath the mucosal of the middle ear for up to five years after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Inner ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inner ear morphogenesis requires a highly coordinated and complex pattern of growth. The cochlea and vestibular system are derived from epithelium that migrates deep from within the embryonic surface early in development. This epithelium forms a fluid-filled cyst called the otic vesicle. The otic vesicle folds, spirals, and elongates to form the membranous labyrinth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75108\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75108 \">picture 2</a>). Neural cells arising in the eighth cranial nerve invade the labyrinth. By the end of the second trimester, the inner ear is developed sufficiently to transduce vibratory energy into neural impulses that are transmitted to the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H653257860\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genes involved with ear development remain poorly understood. A number of genes have been found to be important for the development of the outer and middle ears, including <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/142992&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFYR8Q1aXDxBReNYTLBTBwCTqFna4cSnHWMjxVfqF2cbQ&amp;TOPIC_ID=6299\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">HMX1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/606847&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFUfdC7kgbt7z3sRDeh8bdyqPgDFiWG12tSHxubbQEjvc&amp;TOPIC_ID=6299\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">TCOF1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/601653&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFUfdC7kgbt7z3sRDeh8bdyrzha8UYiPlIAOtGatwhLNG&amp;TOPIC_ID=6299\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">EYA1</a>. They often affect more than one part of the ear, and defects in these genes can result in complete loss of the outer and middle ear structures. Mutations in some of these genes (eg, <em>TCOF1)</em> are associated with human craniofacial syndromes (eg, Treacher Collins syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115370 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The right side is affected more commonly than the left. Bilateral microtia is defined as a length of the external ear that is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In severe cases, the pinna is completely absent (anotia). Microtia and anotia occur in 1 to 3 per 10,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Association with genetic syndromes</strong> &ndash; Microtia and anotia may occur in isolation or in association with genetic syndromes and other malformations, including facial clefts, cardiac defects, limb anomalies, renal anomalies, and holoprosencephaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Microtia is a common finding in children with Treacher-Collins syndrome and craniofacial microsomia (also called Goldenhar syndrome, hemifacial microsomia, oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, and first and second branchial arch syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Treacher Collins syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Craniofacial microsomia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Numerous other microtia-associated syndromes have been reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115370 \">table 1</a>); these may be associated with single-gene defects or chromosomal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Genetic factors also appear to play an important role in isolated, nonsyndromic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a series of 145 cases, more than two-thirds were sporadic and approximately one-third were familial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In the Marx system, type I microtia is characterized as a generally well-formed, perceptibly smaller auricle. In type II microtia, the pinna is malformed and 50 to 66 percent smaller than the contralateral pinna. In grade III microtia, the auricle is severely malformed and usually exhibits a peanut shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F97284\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97284 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> &ndash; Evaluation of infants with microtia and anotia includes audiologic testing and thorough examination to identify associated defects. In some cases, imaging may be warranted to detect associated abnormalities of the external auditory canal, middle, and inner ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Appropriate consultations in the neonatal period include a clinical geneticist, pediatric audiologist, pediatric otolaryngologist, or a pediatric plastic surgeon. Although surgical intervention for unilateral defects seldom is undertaken until the child reaches 6 to 10 years of age, these consultations are important to identify other abnormalities and to provide reassurance for the families. Long-term management may include audiology, particularly if there is associated external auditory canal atresia (aural atresia). Amplification devices are beneficial for children with bilateral hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgical repair</strong> &ndash; A minor abnormality of the pinna may not require correction. When the pinna is grossly deformed or absent, reconstruction often is warranted for cosmetic reasons. Most repairs are undertaken when the child is 6 to 10 years of age, after the pinna has reached 80 percent of its adult size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Microtia repair is complex and often requires several stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A cartilage framework, usually derived from costal cartilage, is created and anchored beneath the skin of the mastoid area. Once it is well attached to surface skin, a postauricular crease is created in a second operation. Additional procedures often are employed for &quot;fine-tuning.&quot; Even in the best hands, the complex structure of the external ear is difficult to duplicate, and cosmetic results vary widely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some experts have advocated the use of synthetic auricular frameworks given the difficulty of creating an aesthetically pleasing auricle from autologous cartilage. Research into customized three-dimensional scaffolds is ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The placement of a prosthetic auricle anchored with an osteointegrated peg remains an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lop or outstanding ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protruding ears usually result from incomplete formation of the antihelical fold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59636\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59636 \">picture 4</a>). This abnormality has no functional significance. However, children with protruding ears sometimes are teased or bullied by their peers. If the protrusion is not severe, non-surgical splinting in the neonatal period may correct the defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For more severe cases, otoplasty can be performed later in childhood, typically when the child is four to six years old. The most common procedures involve the excision of skin from the posterior surface of the auricle and the placement of permanent sutures to reposition the ear and create an antihelical fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These techniques provide high rates of patient and family satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Complications occur in 0 to 8 percent of otoplasties and include hematomas, perichondritis, suture extrusion, and keloid formation. Residual deformity and asymmetry of the two ears may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Preauricular pits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preauricular pits are small indentations located anterior to the helix and superior to the tragus of the ear (bilateral in 25 to 50 percent of cases) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75371\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75371 \">picture 5</a>). They are quite common, noted in approximately 1 percent of white, 5 percent of black, and 10 percent of Asian children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The prevalence is considerably higher in some family lineages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Surgery entails the creation of a new ear canal and ear drum, providing a skin lining for the canal and drum, and mobilizing or repositioning the ossicles to allow transmission of sound. Surgery is more likely to be successful if extensive pneumatization of the mastoid air cells is present and the stapes is mobile. One of the major risks of this surgery is injury to the facial nerve or the dura of the middle cranial fossa. Thus, the procedure should be performed by an experienced otologist and with electrophysiologic facial nerve monitoring. Other complications include chronic myringitis, prosthesis displacement, SNHL, soft-tissue stenosis and tympanic membrane lateralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

These defects in the middle ear's conducting mechanism cause hearing losses ranging from minor to maximal (60dB) and have important effects on communication and learning. Each of these abnormalities is surgically correctable; correction of stapes fixation is most likely to fail because of the delicate attachment of the stapes to the inner ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">INNER EAR MALFORMATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cochlea arises from a cystic invagination of surface epithelium (the otocyst) that pulls away from the vestibular portion of the inner ear during the first trimester and forms an elongating spiral.
