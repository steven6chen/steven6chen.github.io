One method of assessing the amount of dialysis prescribed is to assess urea removal normalized for a measure of body size, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. This parameter can be estimated from the dialyzer urea clearance data supplied by the manufacturer (<strong>K</strong>), the duration of dialysis in minutes (<strong>t</strong>), and the patient's urea space (<strong>V</strong>) as derived from a standard <span class=\"nowrap\">height/weight</span> nomogram.</p><p>A number of the major factors contributing to K are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the dialysis membrane since larger surface area membranes can remove more urea per unit time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The blood flow rate to the dialyzer (Qb) since presenting new plasma with a high urea concentration maintains the favorable gradient for urea removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55473 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dialysate flow rate (Qd) since delivering new fluid containing no urea also maintains the urea concentration gradient.</p><p/><p>Ultrafiltration, which removes urea by convection in a concentration similar to that in the plasma, also plays a contributory role. Convective loss of small solutes is of minor importance with standard dialysis but is the primary route of urea removal with continuous dialytic therapies for acute renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-metabolic-and-hemodynamic-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury: Metabolic and hemodynamic considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As will be seen below, increasing surface area, Qb, or Qd above a certain level is associated with little further increase in urea removal. Thus, once these three parameters are maximized (often with Qb as the limiting factor), the most important determinant affecting the dose of dialysis is its duration (Td). It was previously assumed that the decrease in time could be counterbalanced by increasing the efficiency of dialysis per unit time. However, this hypothesis has not been validated and is erroneous because the delivered dialytic solute removal falls increasingly short of the prescribed amount as Td declines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thus, pressures to shorten Td in an effort to reduce cost and enhance patient and staff convenience generally should be resisted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early studies found that increasing blood or dialysate flow rates did not improve patient wellbeing. The latter could be achieved only by increasing the dialysis surface area or duration of dialysis. These observations suggested that larger &quot;middle molecules&quot; might be of primary importance as uremic toxins. Middle molecules diffuse across the dialysis membrane more slowly; as a result, a large concentration gradient between blood and dialysate is maintained at relatively low blood and dialysate flow rates. Thus, any benefit from increasing these rates is minimal. Clearance can be enhanced by increasing the duration of dialysis or the permeability of the dialyzer.</p><p>The National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) in 1981 was designed to test the relative importance of small and middle molecules as uremic toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The NCDS clearly demonstrated that the clearance of small molecules (such as urea) and the closely associated, time-averaged blood concentration of urea correlated best with patient outcome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>). However, the surrogates for middle-molecule removal almost reached statistical significance. Their failure to do so may be due to the study having been underpowered.</p><p>Although most nephrologists estimate the adequacy of dialysis by measuring urea removal via calculation of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> it is important to appreciate the presence of complicating factors that lower the effective urea clearance below that which is prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is these factors, discussed below, that invalidate the assumption that lowering the duration of dialysis can be compensated for by a proportionate enhancement of dialysis efficiency (ie, solute removal per unit time).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINANTS OF DIALYTIC SOLUTE CLEARANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dialytic clearance of any solute includes both diffusive (concentration gradient) and convective (pressure gradient) removal. Diffusion of a solute is a function of the area-permeability product of the dialyzer (KoA) for that solute as well as the blood flow rate (Qb) and dialysate flow rate (Qd) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Convective loss is primarily determined by the ultrafiltration rate (Quf) as the solute is lost in the same concentration as that in the plasma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-metabolic-and-hemodynamic-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury: Metabolic and hemodynamic considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The figure shows the delivered dialyzer clearance (Kd) over a range of Qb for a dialyzer with a KoA of 961 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and a Qd of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55473 \">figure 1</a>). The relationship between Kd and Qb is linear when Qb is low since the delivery of new blood containing a high urea concentration maintains a high rate of diffusion. At high levels of Qb, further increases in Kd are minimized due to the diffusion limits of the membrane. This curve represents the best clearance that can be achieved at a given Qb in the absence of the complicating factors discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIMINISHED UREA CLEARANCE DUE TO THE PARALLEL NATURE OF HEMODIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When hemodialysis is performed with the dialyzer in series with the central venous and systemic compartments, as with a central venous catheter, urea removal is efficient and most closely approximates that shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55473 \">figure 1</a>). With the dialyzer in series, the entire systemic compartment is available for urea extraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75734\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75734 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>In comparison, hemodialysis using a standard arteriovenous access more closely approximates a parallel procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this setting, flow through the peripheral access (Qac) occurs in parallel to the systemic and central venous compartments, and flow through the dialyzer is in parallel to that in the access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63939\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63939 \">figure 3</a>). These parallel circuits reduce extraction of urea to levels below the theoretical clearance from the dialyzer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55473 \">figure 1</a>). This occurs because dialyzed blood leaving the access short circuits the systemic compartment (ie, the capillaries where this blood refills with urea).</p><p>Blood leaving the dialyzer has a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 60 to 70 percent lower than blood entering the dialyzer. This blood enters the venous system and reduces the BUN of central venous, cardiac, and arterial blood by 5 to 15 percent compared with the average BUN in other (peripheral) veins; the reduction depends on dialyzer blood flow and efficiency, as well as cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a result, blood leaving the heart and returning to the access has a lower urea concentration than if there had been complete equilibration with the systemic circulation. Originally termed &quot;arteriovenous disequilibrium&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], this phenomenon is now termed &quot;cardiopulmonary recirculation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. The net effect of cardiopulmonary recirculation is that the urea concentration of blood returning to the access is not as high as it would be if equilibration occurred, thereby limiting total urea removal.</p><p>Access flow itself has a small (approximately 2 percent) adverse impact on urea clearance from the body. This is apparent from consideration of a patient with an arteriovenous access (unused) who is receiving dialysis via a central venous catheter. Since the blood traversing the arteriovenous access short circuits the capillaries, it does not contribute to urea clearance.</p><p>There is a surprising finding if one measures the BUN in a peripheral vein later in dialysis. In one study, the venous BUN in the arm opposite the fistula exceeded that in the arterial line of the access arm (after access recirculation was excluded) by 36 percent after two hours of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This phenomenon is best explained by considering the ratio of blood flow to organ and tissue volume. When a relatively low rate of perfusion is present, urea is removed from the tissues slowly. The urea concentration in the poorly perfused compartment (eg, the muscles of the arm) and its equilibrated venous drainage remain closer to the high value present at the start of dialysis compared with that in the veins draining well-perfused tissues, in which the BUN declines rapidly as treatment progresses. Originally termed &quot;venovenous disequilibrium&quot; (since veins may differ in their BUN), this phenomenon is usually presented as evidence for the regional blood flow model.</p><p>Both cardiopulmonary recirculation and the regional differences in BUN contribute to the rebound elevation in BUN that occurs shortly after stopping hemodialysis. The BUN promptly rebounds in the central veins and arteries (including the arteriovenous access) as cardiopulmonary recirculation dissipates with a further rebound from late urea movement out of the poorly perfused tissues. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Regional blood flow model'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular access recirculation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Access recirculation is another factor that can impair urea elimination and reduce delivered dialysis dose below that prescribed. Access recirculation occurs when dialyzed blood exiting the dialyzer reverses flow after it re-enters the arteriovenous fistula and is taken up by the dialyzer inlet. Thus, the dialyzer is &quot;seeing&quot; blood from the systemic circuit that has been &quot;diluted&quot; with blood that has just been dialyzed.</p><p>Access recirculation occurs when the blood flow rate (Qb) entering the dialyzer exceeds blood flow through the access (Qac). This most often occurs when there is venous stenosis in the access. In this setting, the Qb can be maintained at prescribed levels by the blood pump in the dialyzer only by creation of a suction effect in the access, causing some of the blood returning to the access from the dialyzer to be pulled back toward the dialysis inlet and redialyzed. A discussion on how to estimate and treat access recirculation is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-recirculation-in-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula recirculation in hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, it is apparent that, in addition to the theoretical clearance of the dialyzer (Kd), the extraction of urea is dependent upon the relationship between cardiac output, Qb, and (to a lesser extent) Qac, as well as the relationship between Qac and Qb (which determines the degree of access recirculation). The following figure shows the degree of impairment of Kd induced by lowering the cardiac output (which increases cardiopulmonary recirculation by diminishing mixing between dialyzed blood and that in the systemic tissue compartment), raising Qb in the setting of a high Qac (which will have the same effect), and increasing access recirculation from 2 to 15 percent of Qb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66749 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Thus, for a given Qb, the total body effective solute clearance (Ktb) may be markedly lower than the theoretical clearance provided by the dialyzer alone. Paying attention only to the latter will result in an unanticipated shortfall in the amount of dialysis actually delivered to the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIMINISHED UREA CLEARANCE DUE TO DIMINISHED EQUILIBRATION WITH INTRACELLULAR STORES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The above discussion has emphasized that maximally efficient dialysis requires the delivery of blood with a high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to the dialyzer. As urea is removed from the extracellular fluid by dialysis, urea moves out of the cells to replete extracellular stores (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68212 \">figure 5</a>). This process is not instantaneous, but follows two-pool kinetics with an average urea mass transfer coefficient (MTCurea) of 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. An MTCurea below 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> puts the patient at risk for under-dialysis since less urea is delivered to the dialyzer to be removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This problem can occur if urea is trapped in compartments with reduced flow (due to vascular disease); there may also be a genetic variation in the rate at which the cell membranes permit urea to leave the cells.</p><p>It is important to appreciate the seemingly paradoxical effect of a reduced MTCurea. There will be a low intra- and postdialysis BUN (a misleading indicator of adequate dialysis) that leads to a low overall rate of urea removal. The higher the MTCurea, the more net urea removal will occur because there will be a higher intra- and postdialysis BUN (which might suggest inadequate dialysis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80093\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80093 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>The inclusion of the effect of a low MTCurea on clearance of the dialyzer (Kd) is shown in the following figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78452 \">figure 7</a>). The net effect of the inclusion of both technical and physiologic limitations inherent in performing hemodialysis can result in a substantial reduction in the total body effective solute clearance (Ktb) of as much as 20 to 50 percent from the predicted Kd.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional blood flow model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative model that has now gained substantial support is the regional blood flow model; this assumes that urea is sequestered within cells of some organs during dialysis because those organs have a low ratio of blood flow to urea content and not as a result of cell membrane-limited diffusion. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58368 \">figure 8</a>). The major organ responsible for this urea sequestration is skeletal muscle, which receives only 15 to 20 percent of the cardiac outflow but may sequester up to 80 percent of the total body urea. This model predicts that postdialysis urea rebound is dependent upon cardiac output (cardiac index) and the amount of muscle mass in a particular individual; it has been validated in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>].</p><p>A more detailed description of this model is also worth considering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Urea is generated by the liver and then distributed to various tissue compartments. These various tissue compartments have different rates of blood perfusion, and the amount of potential urea &quot;trapping&quot; is a function of both the perfusion and the size of the compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58368 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p>Although most compartments with poor perfusion have the highest potential risk of urea sequestration, they are generally small. In contrast, the skeletal compartment is so large that it acts as the dominant tissue &quot;holding&quot; urea. In terms of dialysis efficiency, the limiting factor in urea removal from the body may be more related to the urea trapping in this tissue rather than the dialyzer area-permeability product (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66749 \">figure 4</a>) (KoA) parameter, particularly in the later stages of the dialysis treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER LIMITING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several additional factors can also contribute to a decrease in dialysis delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Inaccurate manufacturer's specifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vivo clearances are often as much as 20 percent lower than manufacturer's in vitro clearances. For this reason, it is desirable to evaluate specific dialyzer clearances in vivo in the dialysis unit using the formula:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;C(x) &#160; = &#160; Qb &#160;x &#160;([Ax &#160;- &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">Vx]/Ax)</span></p></div></div><p>where C(x) refers to the clearance of solute x (urea, creatinine, phosphate, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> are most often used) and Ax and Vx refer to the concentration of x in the arterial and venous lines, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Inaccurate and decreased blood flow rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of blood flow through the dialyzer may be overestimated if there is a problem with the dialyzer pump or the blood line, such as the use of 6 mm tubing with a high blood flow setting or decreased compliance of the plastic tubing. Both of these blood line problems prevent full refill of the tubing after compression by the roller pump, resulting in undetected shortfalls in delivered blood flow.</p><p>In general, higher blood flow rates are observed with arteriovenous accesses versus that obtained with central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The blood flow rate will also be diminished with hemodialysis catheter dysfunction, including reversal of the access lines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced fiber bundle volume from clotting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clotting within the dialyzer can reduce the surface area available for effective dialysis. Standard dialyzer reuse criteria reject dialyzers in which the fiber bundle volume falls below 80 percent. It has been suggested that careful attention to maintaining an adequate heparin anticoagulation of the fibers can minimize the degree of clotting and significantly improve polysulfone dialyzer clearances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Inefficient dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &quot;clock time&quot; for dialysis duration often does not reflect actual dialysis time with optimal blood flows, since it does not include corrections for periods of low blood flow or blood pump cutoff during alarms. Nursing personnel and patients must be counseled that delivery of the proper dialysis prescription requires strict adherence to the prescribed time on dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Errors in measurement of blood urea nitrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predialysis and postdialysis blood for measurement of the urea nitrogen concentration must always be drawn from the dialyzer blood inflow line when blood flow is greatly reduced (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> to minimize any effect of recirculation of dialyzed venous blood. Drawing the postdialysis blood sample within approximately 20 seconds of ending dialysis is common practice. The BUN values obtained using this &quot;slow&quot; flow method of post-BUN blood draw will minimize the effect of access recirculation and not reflect urea rebound from dissipation of cardiopulmonary recirculation or from re-equilibration among well-perfused and poorly perfused tissue compartments. The resulting single-pool (unequilibrated) <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> estimate has a predictable relationship with the two-pool (equilibrated) <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. However, this relationship is altered when the dialysis time is unusually short, the patient unusually small, or dialysis efficiency particularly high (ie, situations of high <span class=\"nowrap\">K/V)</span>. If so, the estimated dialysis dose may be substantially less than the actual, equilibrated value (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57290\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57290 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Residual urea clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with residual renal function may have significant urea loss from the native kidneys. This can be measured and included with the &quot;extracorporeal&quot; dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> to generate a composite <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V;</span> however, assuming that the native clearance is zero may help minimize under-dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TOTAL BODY-EFFECTIVE CLEARANCE AND TIME ON DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The calculated dialysis delivered to the patient is usually estimated by calculating the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> or the urea reduction ratio (the [predialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &ndash; postdialysis BUN] <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> [predialysis BUN]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.) A urea reduction ratio (URR) of 0.6 is usually indicative of adequate dialysis. However, the URR uses an immediate postdialysis BUN that is unequilibrated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57290\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57290 \">figure 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While a late (30-minute) postdialysis BUN is not routinely measured, mathematical modeling allows this value and the equilibrated <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> to be obtained using the routine postdialysis BUN. This equilibrated <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is commonly provided by dialysis laboratories and offers a more accurate assessment of dialysis dose than does the URR.</p><p><br/>An important question is how to correct a low <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> or URR. The optimal approach requires a knowledge of the frequency with which various limiting factors contribute to the low <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. These issues were addressed in a study of 146 stable dialysis patients in whom measurements of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and access recirculation were obtained every month for three successive months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. An abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> value was defined as a decline of &ge;0.2 or &ge;0.1 if the baseline <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> was &ge;1.2 or &lt;1.2, respectively. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 40 percent of low <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> values were due to a lower than prescribed blood flow or time of dialysis, which resulted largely from inadequate needle placement and patient initiated time constraints, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty-five percent of abnormal values resulted from significant access recirculation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cause was not uncovered in the remaining patients; however, subsequent <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> values rapidly returned to baseline values without any intervention.</p><p/><p>Our approach to correcting a low <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> or URR therefore begins by assessing whether there is noncompliance with the dialysis prescription. If found, further evaluation is usually unnecessary, and patient and staff education concerning the importance of the dialysis prescription is undertaken. Among those in whom dialysis is being properly administered, we estimate the degree of access recirculation and, if elevated, correct any venous stenosis that may be present.</p><p>When the primary problem is cardiopulmonary recirculation or delayed transfer out of the cells, the equilibrated <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> but not the URR, will be lowered. Under these circumstances, urea clearance of the blood delivered to the dialyzer will not be substantially improved by dialyzer size, blood flow rate (Qb), or dialysate flow rate (Qd). The only way to compensate for the reduced efficiency of urea removal is to increase the time on dialysis (Td).</p><p>Suppose, for example:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Kd &#160; = &#160; 270 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (where Kd is derived from the manufacturer's data and is theoretical [eg, the best possible without considering various degrading factors])<br/> &#160;Td &#160; = &#160; 180 min<br/> &#160;Vd &#160; = &#160; 40,000 mL (40 liters)</p></div></div><p>The calculated <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> will equal 1.2:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &#160; = &#160; 270 &#160;x &#160;180 &#160;&divide; &#160;40,000 &#160; = &#160; 1.2</p></div></div><p>If, however, the total body effective solute clearance (Ktb) is 70 percent of delivered dialyzer clearance (Kd) or 189 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> then to achieve the same <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.2 requires an increase in Td to 260 min.</p><p>This example demonstrates that short Td hemodialysis may be limited by decreased total body solute clearance, as well as symptomatic intolerance of high ultrafiltration rates. Recommendations for a target delivered <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> (single pool or unequilibrated) are approximately 1.4, with a minimum level of at least 1.2 (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>). Even with the use of large dialyzers and high blood and dialysate flow rates, attainment of this degree of hemodialysis will require a minimum treatment duration of four hours in many patients.</p><p>To further improve clearance, another option is to enhance the duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the frequency of dialysis, even in combination with slower blood and dialysate flow rates. This regimen may also provide higher clearance of solutes larger than urea since their removal is hampered during conventional dialysis by slow intercompartmental transfer. Using a two-body-compartment mathematical model, one report calculated the removal of urea and creatinine (low-molecular-weight surrogates), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> and inulin (middle-molecule surrogates), and beta-2 microglobulin (high-molecular-weight surrogate) using the following five different hemodialysis regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prescription for regimen A (standard therapy) was three times per week, 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/session</span> (720 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/week),</span> and blood and dialysate flow rates of 350 and 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regimen B (daily, short-time therapy) was seven times per week, 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/session</span> (700 <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes/week),</span> and blood and dialysate flow of 350 and 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regimens C, D, and E (low-flow, long-time therapies) were three, five, and seven times per week, respectively, with each session lasting eight hours, and blood and dialysate flow rates of 300 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> respectively. Regimens C, D, and E therefore consisted of 1440, 2400, and 3360 minutes of dialysis, respectively.</p><p/><p>When compared with the clearance of solute resulting from standard therapy (regimen A), the following conclusions were drawn concerning regimens B, C, D, and E:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite an equivalent time of dialysis, daily, short-time therapy (regimen B) resulted in a mild increase in urea and middle-molecule clearance (3 to 6 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three times per week low-flow, long-time regimen (C) had an equivalent clearance of urea but increased clearance of middle and large molecules.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The daily low-flow, long-time regimen (E) resulted in markedly higher clearances of all solutes (eg, 2.2, 3.6, and 2.2 times higher clearances for urea, inulin, and beta-2 microglobulin, respectively).</p><p/><p>This study highlights the potential pitfalls of relying too heavily on use of urea as a surrogate marker to assess dialysis dose. Urea clearance is readily dissociated from middle- and large-molecule clearance when treatment time and frequency are modified. Peritoneal and hemodialysis are roughly equivalent despite striking differences in urea clearance. Even consideration of solute size may be inadequate. Intracellular solutes that can move readily across a dialysis membrane may be rate limited by cellular membranes, making their removal more treatment-frequency dependent rather than treatment-time or blood-flow dependent.</p><p>Nocturnal hemodialysis, a regimen in which dialysis is performed overnight for at least eight hours six to seven times per week using low blood and dialysate flows, replicates regimen E and has therefore been advocated as an alternative and perhaps preferable hemodialysis regimen (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;</a>). Whether this or similar regimens are associated with improved outcomes compared with conventional hemodialysis is uncertain. The Frequent Hemodialysis Network Nocturnal Trial randomly assigned 87 patients to conventional, thrice-weekly hemodialysis and nocturnal, six-times-weekly treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Despite a 2.45-fold longer average weekly treatment time in the nocturnal group, no definitive benefit of the much longer and more frequent treatments could be demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Such reductions may not be wise, since women may be particularly likely to benefit from more dialysis. In the HEMO study, women randomized to the high-dose group (equilibrated <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> 1.45) had a 19 percent lower mortality rate than those in the standard-dose group (equilibrated <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> 1.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

One method of assessing the amount of dialysis prescribed is to assess urea removal normalized for a measure of body size, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. This parameter is calculated from the dialyzer urea clearance data supplied by the manufacturer (<strong>K</strong>), the duration of dialysis in minutes (<strong>t</strong>), and the patient's urea space (<strong>V</strong>) as derived from a standard <span class=\"nowrap\">height/weight</span> nomogram. However, a number of factors may cause this approach to overestimate the delivered dialysis dose. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Historical background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that contribute to K include the size of the dialysis membrane, the blood flow rate to the dialyzer, and the dialysate flow rate. Increasing surface area above a certain level is associated with little further increase in urea removal. Thus, once these three parameters are maximized, the most important determinant affecting the dose of dialysis is its duration. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complicating factors may lower the effective urea clearance below that which is prescribed. These factors include cardiopulmonary recirculation and vascular access recirculation. Decreased urea equilibration between intracellular and extracellular compartments and urea sequestration may also contribute. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diminished urea clearance due to diminished equilibration with intracellular stores'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional factors that can also contribute to a decrease in dialysis delivery include inaccurate manufacturer&rsquo;s specified clearances; inaccurate and decreased blood flow rates; clotting within the dialyzer, which reduces the available surface area; inaccurate time on dialysis due to lack of correction for periods of low blood flow; and errors in measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Other limiting factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correcting a low <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> requires a knowledge of the frequency with which various limiting factors contribute to the low <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. Our approach to correcting a low <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> begins by assessing whether there is noncompliance with the dialysis prescription. Among those in whom dialysis is being properly administered, we estimate the degree of access recirculation and, if elevated, correct any venous stenosis that may be present. If the primary problem is cardiopulmonary recirculation or delayed transfer out of the cells, then urea clearance of the blood delivered to the dialyzer is already at near maximal levels. The only way to compensate for the reduced efficiency of urea removal is to increase the time on dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Total body-effective clearance and time on dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Parker TF, Husni L.
