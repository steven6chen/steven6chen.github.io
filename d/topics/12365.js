In immunocompromised hosts, however, CMV infection can result in a broad array of clinical presentations, including a nonspecific syndrome (which may include fever, malaise, weakness, myalgias, arthralgias, leukopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia in the setting of viremia) or end-organ disease such as retinitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, or gastrointestinal tract ulceration. These manifestations are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p>An overview of the diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of CMV infections will be presented here. The approach to the diagnosis of CMV is discussed separately. The manifestations of CMV in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients are also presented elsewhere.

Molecular amplification methods are now the standard of care for diagnosing cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; in the past, serologic testing and viral cultures from multiple sites were the cornerstones of diagnosis.</p><p>Appropriate diagnostic tests are essential for the management of CMV infection and disease in immunocompromised patients. Several diagnostic modalities are available, including serology, qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, pp65 antigenemia, culture, and histopathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101937\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101937 \">table 1</a>). The techniques for detecting CMV (quantitative polymerase chain reaction and CMV pp65 antigenemia) have improved considerably.</p><p>The approach to diagnosis of CMV infection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-cytomegalovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5887729\"><span class=\"h1\">SEROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serology provides indirect evidence of recent or prior cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection based upon changes in antibody titers at different time points during a clinical illness. Many different antibody detection techniques are available. Enzyme immunoassays and indirect and anticomplement immunofluorescence assays are the most commonly used serologic tests in clinical laboratories; complement-fixation techniques, immune adherence hemagglutination, indirect hemagglutination, and neutralization tests are performed in a limited number of diagnostic laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Serologic tests measure the presence of anti-CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104413438\"><span class=\"h2\">Recent or acute infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of recent or acute CMV is considered probable (though not definite) in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The detection of CMV-specific IgM antibodies (suggesting recent seroconversion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fourfold or greater increase in CMV-specific IgG titers in paired specimens obtained at least two to four weeks apart</p><p/><p>Although the sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests are adequate, the requirement for paired serum samples limits the utility of these tests in establishing a timely diagnosis. CMV-specific IgM antibodies are typically detectable within the first two weeks after the development of symptoms and may persist for several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among patients with acute CMV infection who had serial serum samples available for analysis, CMV-specific IgM antibodies were detectable for a period of four to six months after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Therefore, a positive CMV-specific IgM antibody alone may provide misleading information if a prior baseline test is not available (in cases in which it represents prior infection rather than current infection).</p><p>CMV-specific IgG antibodies are often not detectable until two to three weeks following the onset of symptoms and persist lifelong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104413444\"><span class=\"h2\">Past infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic tests are also helpful in determining past exposure to CMV infection. When assessing past CMV exposure or infection, any IgG result above the cutoff of the test is considered positive. The cutoff may vary depending on the method used, and it is generally provided with test results. CMV IgG results are particularly useful for the management of immunocompromised hosts at risk for CMV reactivation. As an example, HIV-infected patients with serologic evidence of past exposure to CMV warrant monitoring for CMV retinitis in the setting of progressive immunocompromise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104413450\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic tests are also helpful in determining risk of acquisition of CMV. For example, a seronegative patient is not at risk for CMV reactivation; on the other hand, the same patient is at high risk for new acquisition of infection if transplanted with an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in lung transplant recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of cytomegalovirus disease in kidney transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5887757\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR ASSAYS (PCR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most laboratories use quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; viral load) tests for monitoring patients at risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, diagnosing active CMV disease, and monitoring response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Qualitative CMV PCR assays are very sensitive but cannot distinguish between latent DNA and actively replicating virus. They are also unable to differentiate low-level from high-level viral replication, which is important for predicting the risk of CMV disease and for monitoring the response to therapy. Given these limitations, qualitative PCR has a limited role for the diagnosis or management of patients with CMV infection. Some centers use a qualitative PCR initially and only do a quantitative PCR if the qualitative PCR result is positive.</p><p>Quantitative CMV DNA assays include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COBAS <span class=\"nowrap\">AmpliPrep/COBAS</span> TaqMan CMV test &ndash; The COBAS <span class=\"nowrap\">AmpliPrep/COBAS</span> TaqMan CMV test is a real-time PCR test that targets the polymerase gene and is calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) international standard to quantify the CMV load in plasma with a reported range from 137 to 9,100,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (see <a href=\"#H104412383\" class=\"local\">'International standard'</a> below).

This test has been approved by the FDA to use as an aid in the management of solid organ transplant patients undergoing treatment for CMV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory-developed PCR assays &ndash; There are a variety of analyte-specific reagents available to assist laboratories in the development of assays. Most laboratory-developed assays use real-time PCR technologies, which have several advantages compared with standard PCR methods, including decreased risk of carryover contamination, broader linear range, and more rapid turnaround time. The performance, sensitivity, and linear range of laboratory-developed assays vary because of different specimen types, nucleic acid extraction methods, gene targets, primers, probes, detection methods, and quantitation standards. As a result, there may not be close agreement in viral load values among different laboratories.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104412383\"><span class=\"h2\">International standard</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2010, an international standard developed by the WHO and composed of a standardized amount of CMV became available from the National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The availability of this reference reagent is an important advance in CMV testing, since it should allow for the standardization of viral load values among different laboratory-developed tests when results are expressed as international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It was hoped that this would facilitate clinical studies to determine the viral load values that correlate with the development of clinical disease. However, one study has shown that using the international standard, variability in CMV DNA results reported on individual specimens has been reduced but clinically relevant variability persists, limiting meaningful interassay result comparison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A study that used digital PCR showed that quantitative results for patient specimens showed good correlation in most comparisons, with some showing poorer correlations when testing samples with low viral loads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Commercial assays using digital PCR methods are not available.</p><p>As more laboratories convert to using commercial assays calibrated to the international standard and move away from individual laboratory-based tests, the agreement between laboratories should continue to improve.</p><p>Establishing the appropriate viral load cutoff for the diagnosis of CMV will likely depend upon a variety of factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assay used</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specimen type (eg, plasma, whole blood)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organ transplanted</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serostatus of both the recipient and donor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of immunosuppression</p><p/><p>An international multicenter study compared the COBAS <span class=\"nowrap\">AmpliPrep/COBAS</span> TaqMan CMV test with laboratory-developed PCR assays at five transplant centers using a panel of samples prepared from CMV virus stock (at six dilutions ranging from 2.18 to 6.7 log<sub>10</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> and the CMV standards developed by the WHO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The level of agreement was high for the COBAS <span class=\"nowrap\">AmpliPrep/COBAS</span> TaqMan CMV test across different laboratories as demonstrated by a smaller range of mean concentrations of CMV panel members by site and narrower confidence intervals of the combined data for each CMV panel member compared with laboratory-developed PCR assays.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5887764\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparisons of tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, prior to the development of the international standard, lack of standardization of CMV PCR assays meant that different laboratories could obtain different results from the same specimen. The variability of viral load values was assessed in a multicenter study involving 33 laboratories in the United States, Europe, and Canada; this study was performed prior to the availability of the international CMV standard and showed that the variability of the viral load values for individual samples ranged from 2.0 to 4.3 log<sub>10</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As an example, a viral load value of 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> in one laboratory may be reported as 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (3 log<sub>10</sub> difference) when using an assay developed by a different laboratory. As mentioned above, one study has shown improvement in viral load values with the use of the CMV international standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H104412383\" class=\"local\">'International standard'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104412470\"><span class=\"h3\">Whole blood versus plasma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma or whole blood specimens are typically used for CMV load testing. DNA is detected more frequently and viral load values are often higher in whole blood compared with plasma because both cell-free and intracellular viruses are detected. One study showed that viral load values in most patients are about 1 log<sub>10</sub> (10-fold) higher in whole blood compared with plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although testing of whole blood specimens is more sensitive than plasma, low levels of CMV DNA in whole blood do not always correlate with active CMV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>CMV DNA is stable in whole blood and plasma for up to five days when stored at 4&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and for three to four days when stored at room temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is the preferred anticoagulant for quantitative CMV PCR assays. One study showed that, once plasma is separated from whole blood, the plasma DNA is stable for 14 days at 4&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104411749\"><span class=\"h1\">CMV ANTIGENEMIA ASSAYS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia assays permit the rapid and direct detection of CMV proteins (pp65) in peripheral blood leukocytes. This technique employs fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies specific to the pp65 lower matrix protein of CMV in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Positive results are reported as the number of cells with staining per total number of cells counted. Results are generally available within 24 hours, and the test performs well in HIV-infected patients and recipients of solid organ transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

Diagnosis is based on the presence of inclusion bodies, typically basophilic intranuclear inclusions, although eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions may also be seen; the diagnosis of CMV in tissue sections can be confirmed with immunohistochemical staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Detection of CMV inclusions in a lung biopsy or in a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen supports the diagnosis of tissue invasive disease and increases the predictive value of a positive culture.

Thus, culture cannot be relied upon as a rapid diagnostic test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional culture for CMV lacks sensitivity, particularly when culturing blood (peripheral blood leukocytes). As noted above, CMV can be cultured from of variety of body fluids and tissues, but it is most useful in the diagnosis of congenital CMV (urine) and tissue invasive disease. The sensitivity of culture from blood samples is inadequate for the diagnosis of CMV disease; molecular methods or antigenemia should be used for this purpose.

Following centrifugation of clinical samples (eg, urine, blood, bronchial washings) to increase the absorption of virus, cell monolayers are exposed to monoclonal antibodies against early antigen. Binding of antibodies is indicative of &quot;early&quot; CMV replication within the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Results are typically available within two to three days after specimens are obtained. The sensitivity of shell vial culture varies with specimen type and is lower for blood samples compared with other body fluids. As with conventional culture, the sensitivity of shell vial culture for blood samples is inadequate for clinical use. Rapid shell vial cultures also have the same limitations regarding specificity as conventional culture. Most laboratories that culture CMV rely on shell vial culture (rather than conventional culture) due to the rapid turnaround time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5887778\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring cytomegalovirus (CMV) load is a useful approach for assessing the likelihood of drug resistance. Markers suggestive of CMV resistance include a rising viral load, rebounding viral load, and a persistently elevated viral load in the setting of antiviral therapy. In the past, resistance testing was performed using phenotypic methods, which required isolation of the virus in cell culture, determining the viral titer, and then culturing the virus in the presence of drug (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>). This was a tedious process that took weeks to months to complete and had little impact on patient care. Currently, resistance testing is done using genotypic assays to identify specific resistance mutations using automated sequencing methods. The assays are done directly from clinical specimens (plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage) and usually require a viral load of &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In immunocompromised hosts, however, CMV infection can result in a broad array of clinical presentations, including viral syndrome, retinitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, esophagitis, and colitis. These complications are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H5887715\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate diagnostic tests are essential for the management of CMV infection and disease in immunocompromised patients. Several diagnostic modalities are available, including serology, qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pp65 antigenemia, culture, and histopathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101937\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101937 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5887722\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of recent or acute CMV is considered probable in the following circumstances:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The detection of CMV-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibodies (suggesting recent seroconversion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A fourfold or greater increase in CMV-specific IgG titers in paired specimens obtained at least two to four weeks apart (see <a href=\"#H5887729\" class=\"local\">'Serology'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgM antibody can persist for several months and, therefore, may provide misleading information if a prior baseline test is not available (in cases in which it represents prior infection rather than current infection). (See <a href=\"#H5887729\" class=\"local\">'Serology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic tests are also helpful in determining past exposure to CMV infection. This information is particularly useful for the management of immunosuppressed hosts at risk for CMV reactivation. (See <a href=\"#H5887729\" class=\"local\">'Serology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Real-time PCR tests for the quantification of CMV DNA are widely used for diagnosis and monitoring of CMV disease. Agreement in viral load values is improving with the availability of an international standard and the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of tests that are calibrated to the international standard. In spite of these advances, viral load values vary between tests. (See <a href=\"#H5887757\" class=\"local\">'Molecular assays (PCR)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral load testing can be done using plasma or whole blood specimens. Higher values are observed in whole blood specimens compared with plasma. The same assay and specimen type should be used for monitoring patients over time. (See <a href=\"#H104412470\" class=\"local\">'Whole blood versus plasma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMV antigenemia assays permit the rapid detection of CMV proteins in peripheral blood leukocytes; the test is more sensitive than culture for the detection of CMV in blood, and higher numbers of positive cells correlate with risk of developing active disease. The limitations of the antigenemia test include lack of stability of the whole blood specimen, insensitivity when the patient has a low neutrophil count, and difficulties with assay standardization. (See <a href=\"#H104411749\" class=\"local\">'CMV antigenemia assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histopathology and immunohistochemical staining of tissue samples are useful for the diagnosis of tissue invasive disease. (See <a href=\"#H5887771\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMV culture can be performed on blood, tissue, and a variety of body fluids but is most useful for the diagnosis of congenital CMV and tissue invasive disease. Shell viral culture has replaced conventional culture in many clinical laboratories because of the rapid time to results (one to three days) of the former culture type. The detection of CMV in culture does not confirm active CMV disease, since immunosuppressed patients often shed virus in the urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and stool for prolonged periods of time in the absence of clinical illness. (See <a href=\"#H77625576\" class=\"local\">'Conventional culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMV antiviral resistance testing is performed directly from clinical specimens (usually plasma or whole blood); specific drug-related mutations are identified using automated sequencing. Optimal results are obtained when the viral load value is &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H5887778\" class=\"local\">'Resistance testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to the diagnosis of CMV infection is discussed separately.
