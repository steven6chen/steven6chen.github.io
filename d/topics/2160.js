The bone marrow is the tissue in the center of certain bones. Normally, the bone marrow makes blood cells. There are different types of blood cells, and all of them are made from cells in the bone marrow called &quot;hematopoietic stem cells.&quot;</p><p>If the bone marrow does not work normally, it can't make the blood cells a person's body needs. To treat this, a doctor can put healthy stem cells, called &quot;donor&quot; cells, into the bone marrow. The donor cells can then grow into normal blood cells. A bone marrow transplant is also called a &quot;stem cell transplant&quot; or &quot;hematopoietic stem cell transplant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614878\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might I have a bone marrow transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might have a bone marrow transplant to help treat a cancer, such as leukemia or lymphoma, or another medical condition that affects your bone marrow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614885\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of bone marrow transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are different types of bone marrow transplant, depending on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where the donor cells come from. Donor cells can come from:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Your own body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who are related to you and whose blood matches yours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who are not related to you but whose blood matches yours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood (that matches yours) from a newborn baby's umbilical cord</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What treatment you have to prepare your body for the transplant</p><p/><p>The right type of bone marrow transplant for you will depend on your cancer or other medical condition, age, other health conditions, and possible donors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614892\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens before a bone marrow transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will do an exam and tests. He or she will talk with you and your family about what to expect during and after the procedure.</p><p>Your doctor will put a thin tube into a blood vessel in your upper chest. This tube, called a &quot;central line,&quot; will stay in place during your hospital stay. Your doctor will use it to give you treatments, as well as take blood for tests.</p><p>Your doctor will also need to collect stem cells if the donor cells are coming from you. (If the donor cells are coming from someone else, another doctor will collect those.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614899\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a bone marrow transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, you will get chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both. Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer and other cells. These treatments prepare your bone marrow to receive the new stem cells.</p><p>After this, your doctor will put the donor cells into your body through your central line or another vein. The stem cells will find their way to your bone marrow. There, they can start making normal blood cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614906\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a bone marrow transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people stay in the hospital for weeks to months after a bone marrow transplant.</p><p>Right after a bone marrow transplant, your body has a higher chance than usual of getting an infection. Because of this, you will need to stay in a special hospital room and get certain medicines.</p><p>Your doctor might give you other treatments, depending on your symptoms. He or she will also do blood tests each day to check that your bone marrow transplant worked.</p><p>Once your bone marrow is working normally and you return home, you will need to see your doctor for regular follow-ups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614913\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of a bone marrow transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The side effects depend on where your donor cells came from, as well as which treatment you have before the transplant.</p><p>The most common short-term side effects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mouth sores and diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair loss (from the head, face, and body)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung, liver, or bone problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;graft versus host disease&quot; (GVHD) &ndash; In GVHD, the donor cells can attack organs in your body. This can cause a skin rash, diarrhea, and liver problems. GVHD can only happen in people who get donor cells from someone else.</p><p/><p>People can also have long-term side effects that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble getting pregnant &ndash; If you want to have a baby in the future, talk with your doctor before your bone marrow transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other cancers that can happen years later</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-lasting GVHD</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614920\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=donating-bone-marrow-or-blood-stem-cells-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Donating bone marrow or blood stem cells (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hodgkin-lymphoma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hodgkin lymphoma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neutropenia-and-fever-in-people-being-treated-for-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neutropenia and fever in people being treated for cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
