It was initially described as &quot;Drusenfieber&quot; or glandular fever in 1889, but the term &quot;infectious mononucleosis&quot; was later used in 1920 to describe six college students with a febrile illness characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and atypical mononuclear cells in the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The relationship between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and IM was established when a laboratory worker was infected with EBV and developed IM and a newly positive heterophile test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents will be reviewed here. A complete description of EBV and other clinical manifestations of EBV infection (including malignancy) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-epstein-barr-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of Epstein-Barr virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widely disseminated herpesvirus that is spread by intimate contact between susceptible persons and EBV shedders. The virus has not been recovered from environmental sources, suggesting that humans are the major reservoir.</p><p>Antibodies to EBV have been demonstrated in all population groups with a worldwide distribution; approximately 90 to 95 percent of adults are eventually EBV-seropositive. By age four, EBV seroprevalence is close to 100 percent in developing countries and ranges from 25 to 50 percent in lower socioeconomic groups in the United States. Many attribute this finding to intense personal contact and poor personal hygiene among children, which provide opportunities for early acquisition and subsequent spread of EBV.</p><p>EBV acquired during childhood years is often subclinical; less than 10 percent of children develop clinical infection despite the high rates of exposure. The incidence of symptomatic infection begins to rise in adolescent through adult years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Large studies of infectious mononucleosis are now decades old, but traditionally the peak incidence of infection has been described in the 15 to 24-year age range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some data derived in the United Kingdom suggest that infectious mononucleosis (IM) cases may be occurring later in life with increasing severity, requiring hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. IM is relatively uncommon in adults, accounting for less than two percent of pharyngitis in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The vast majority of adults are not susceptible to this infection because of prior exposure.</p><p>The differences observed between infants and young adults with regard to symptomatic infection may relate to the size of the viral inoculum at the time of infection or to the intensity of cellular immune responses driven by EBV-infected B cells.</p><p>The incidence of clinical infection is approximately 30 times higher in whites than blacks in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This may reflect both earlier exposures to EBV among the latter group and the higher frequency of asymptomatic infection when acquired by young children. In addition, IM occurs more frequently in same sex twins and first degree siblings, compared with second and third degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, genetic factors may influence who develops clinical disease. In one case series, GATA2 deficiency was associated with severe primary EBV requiring hospitalization or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with lymphoma, suggesting that this genetic deficiency may influence disease presentation in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25630532\"><span class=\"h2\">Person-to-person</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following infectious mononucleosis, virus may be shed in salivary secretions at high levels for a prolonged period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Oral shedding persists for a median duration of approximately six months after onset of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although it should be pointed out that once infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), virus may be intermittently shed in the oropharynx for decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>].</p><p>Although EBV primarily spreads via passage of saliva, it is not a particularly contagious disease. In a classic study conducted among college students, susceptible roommates of patients with either symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (IM) or asymptomatic viral shedding were no more likely to seroconvert or develop clinical illness than other college students without evidence of preexisting EBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The virus can persistently shed in the oropharynx of patients with IM for up to 18 months following clinical recovery; this may explain in part why only a small number of patients with IM recall previous contact with an infected individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Intrafamilial spread among siblings has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25630539\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV has been isolated in breast milk from healthy nursing mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, in one study, there was no difference in EBV seropositivity between exclusively nursed or bottle-fed infants, suggesting that breastfeeding is not an important route of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25630546\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV has also been isolated in both cervical epithelial cells and in male seminal fluid, suggesting that transmission may also occur sexually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. In an epidemiologic study of more than 2000 university students in Scotland, questionnaires and serum samples were analyzed to examine risk factors for EBV seropositivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Sexual activity before college admission was significantly associated with an increased risk of EBV seropositivity. Furthermore, the risk of a seropositive status increased with the number of sexual partners. </p><p>Despite the recovery of EBV in genital secretions, studies have been unable to discriminate with certainty whether EBV was acquired through an oral or genital route. In one prospective study that followed EBV antibody-negative university freshmen, the time to infection in individuals reporting deep kissing without coitus was similar to those who reported deep kissing plus coitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Both groups had a significantly higher risk of acute EBV infection than subjects reporting no kissing or coitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with oropharyngeal epithelial cells allows replication of the virus, release of EBV into the oropharyngeal secretions, and infection of B cells in the lymphoid-rich areas of the oropharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. EBV-infected B cells are responsible for the dissemination of infection throughout the lymphoreticular system. The incubation period prior to the development of symptoms averages four to eight weeks.</p><p>A prospective study was performed in 20 subjects with serologically confirmed primary EBV infection to assess viral kinetics in various compartments, including whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and oral wash fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The median half-life of viral elimination from whole blood in 19 subjects was three days; quantity in this compartment correlated with severity of symptoms. In contrast, virus persisted at an elevated level for 32 weeks in the oropharynx in asymptomatic subjects, consistent with the theory that EBV is transmitted via saliva.</p><p>Primary EBV infection of B lymphocytes induces circulating antibodies directed against viral and unrelated antigens found on sheep and horse red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The latter antibodies, termed heterophile antibodies, are a heterogeneous group of mostly IgM antibodies that do not cross-react with EBV antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Rarely, infected cells produce antineutrophil, antierythrocyte, and antiplatelet antibodies, which are responsible for some of the less common clinical manifestations associated with infectious mononucleosis (IM) (see below). An EBV-specific serologic response can also be documented, although this is necessary for less than 10 percent of heterophile antibody-negative IM cases.</p><p>EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are considered essential in controlling acute and reactivation infection. T cell activation leads to a T helper 1-type profile with production of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The atypical lymphocytes, that appear in the peripheral blood of patients with acute IM between one and three weeks after the onset of symptoms, are primarily activated (HLA-DR+) CD8+ T-cells and also include CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55986\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55986 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. </p><p>Despite these immune responses, which control the initial lytic infection, EBV becomes a lifelong infection as it establishes latency with periodic reactivation with oral shedding of EBV. On the other hand, insufficient cellular immune responses may result in a poorly-controlled EBV infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> generate an EBV-induced malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;, section on 'Malignancy'</a>.) Even with sufficient immune responses, some epidemiological studies have linked IM to increased risks of other conditions, such as Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Other studies have linked acquisition of infection to increased risks for autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Such associations will require significant additional study to prove causation as well as whether they could be a result of direct viral, or rather immunological consequences. Such concerns have heightened interest in exploring potential preventative strategies, such as an EBV vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic IM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical features of infectious mononucleosis (IM) include fever, pharyngitis, adenopathy, fatigue, and atypical lymphocytosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57448 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A review of over 500 patients found that lymphadenopathy was present in all patients, fever in 98 percent, and pharyngitis in 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. The syndrome is often heralded by malaise, headache, and low grade fever before development of these more specific signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/5,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,44</a>].</p><p>Fatigue may be persistent and severe. In a prospective study of 150 patients, most initial symptoms (eg, fever, sore throat) had resolved by one month but fatigue resolved more slowly and persisted in 13 percent of patients at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Fatigue appears to be more common with a more profound impact on studies and exercise abilities in young female university students compared with male students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Lymph node involvement in IM is typically symmetric and more commonly involves the posterior cervical than the anterior chains. The posterior cervical nodes are deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscles and must be carefully palpated. The nodes may be large and moderately tender. Lymphadenopathy may also become more generalized, which distinguishes IM from other causes of pharyngitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Lymphadenopathy peaks in the first week and then gradually subsides over two to three weeks.</p><p>A history of sore throat is often accompanied by pharyngeal inflammation and tonsillar exudates, which may appear white, gray-green, or even necrotic. Palatal petechiae with streaky hemorrhages and blotchy red macules are occasionally present; this finding may also be seen in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis.</p><p>Rare complications of IM include peritonsillar abscess or airway occlusion secondary to edema of the soft palate and tonsils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of clinical variants of IM in which some but not all of the classic findings are present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with acute EBV infection have relatively mild disease, and some present with pharyngitis and tonsillitis in the absence of a full-blown IM syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Among 66 EBV-seronegative university students who developed primary EBV infection, 77 percent had the usual IM syndrome, 12 percent had atypical symptoms, and only 11 percent were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients present with fever and lymphadenopathy without pharyngitis, the so-called &quot;typhoidal form&quot; of illness.

When splenic rupture occurs, it does so spontaneously in over one-half of patients. It typically occurs about 14 days after symptom onset; however, it can range from four days to as far as eight weeks.

As previously mentioned, IgG antibodies to VCA and EBNA are present for life in patients with prior EBV exposure and are not markers of active process suggesting true chronic acute EBV infection. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'EBV-specific antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p>EBV infection has also received a great deal of attention in past years as a possible etiologic agent for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID). This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Provision of adequate fluids and nutrition is also important. It is prudent to get adequate rest, although complete bed rest is unnecessary.</p><p>The use of corticosteroids in the treatment of EBV-induced IM has been controversial. In a multicenter, placebo-controlled study of 94 patients with acute IM, the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> reduced oropharyngeal shedding of the virus but did not affect the duration of symptoms or lead to an earlier return to school or work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis of seven studies found insufficient evidence to recommend steroid treatment for symptom relief; furthermore, two studies reported severe complications in patients assigned to the corticosteroid arm compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. We do not recommend corticosteroid therapy for routine cases of IM since it is generally a self-limited illness and there are theoretical concerns about immunosuppression during clinical illness with a virus that has been causally linked to a variety of malignancies. However, corticosteroids may be considered in the management of patients with some EBV-associated complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications including airway obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroids, as well as emergent consultation with an otolaryngologist, are warranted in individuals with impending airway obstruction (manifested clinically by difficulty breathing or dyspnea in the recumbent position). Data on dosing and duration of corticosteroid therapy is scant. One case series described children with impending airway closure who were treated successfully with high-dose corticosteroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every six hours) but no information was given on duration of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Once clinical improvement has been achieved, tapering the corticosteroid dose slowly (eg, over 7 to 14 days) is likely prudent.</p><p>Corticosteroid therapy may be also considered in those with severe overwhelming life-threatening infection (eg, fulminant liver failure) or other complications such as severe hemolytic or aplastic anemia. Data supporting benefit of corticosteroids in these settings are less robust than what is found for the treatment of IM-related airway obstruction.</p><p>Despite lack of evidence, one recent retrospective study of 206 patients with IM treated at a single tertiary medical center found that 45 percent received corticosteroids mainly for constitutional symptoms; only 8 percent of patients were treated based on traditional criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a> is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits permissive EBV infection through inhibition of EBV DNA polymerase but has no effect on latent infection or ability to cure the infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acyclovir: An overview&quot;</a>.) Specific therapy of acute EBV infections with intravenous and oral formulations of acyclovir has been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/114,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,118</a>]. Short-term suppression of oral viral shedding can be demonstrated, but significant clinical benefit has not been shown.</p><p>A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> in the treatment of acute IM, including two trials of intravenous therapy in patients with severe disease, also failed to show a clinical benefit compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].

More than 50 percent of patients with IM develop splenic enlargement within the first two weeks of symptoms; as a result, the central issue is avoiding activities that may precipitate splenic rupture, while a secondary consideration relates to resumption of training in an athlete complaining of fatigue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoiding splenic rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All athletes should refrain from sport activities during early illness. As recuperation occurs, clinicians should keep in mind that spontaneous or traumatic splenic rupture in the setting of IM appears to be most likely within 2 to 21 days after the onset of clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Descriptions of splenic rupture after the fourth week are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/59,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,121</a>].</p><p>Recommendations to resume sports are somewhat arbitrary given the lack of prospective data. Several authors recommend potential resumption of all sport activities, except for strenuous contact sports, no earlier than 21 days after illness onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,123</a>]. Others advocate a more universal four week time frame regardless of activity level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p>A conservative synthesis of retrospective studies yields the following suggestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For athletes planning to resume non-contact sports, training can be gradually restarted starting three weeks from symptom onset. This recommendation assumes that participants avoid any activities capable of causing chest or abdominal trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For strenuous contact sports (including football, gymnastics, rugby, hockey, lacrosse, wrestling, diving, and basketball) or activities associated with increased intraabdominal pressure (such as weightlifting) that may carry a higher risk of splenic injury, we recommend waiting a minimum of four weeks after illness onset.</p><p/><p>Ways in which to document that the spleen has returned to normal size vary from practitioner to practitioner. Splenic palpation or percussion is generally unreliable in athletes with firm abdominal musculature, although experienced examiners can trust a positive finding of enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. The safest option may be obtaining an ultrasound examination to document resolution of splenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>]. However, the use of imaging studies before a return to sports remains a debated issue due to a lack of clinical outcomes data and the cost of ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p>Some patients with IM appear to have splenic enlargement that persists on serial ultrasound studies. This may be due to the occasional long-term splenomegaly seen after IM or to &quot;normal&quot; splenomegaly that may be observed in 3 to 7 percent of healthy young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/130,131\" class=\"abstract_t\">130,131</a>]. Since seven weeks is among the latest descriptions of IM-related splenic rupture, clinical judgment must dictate when to allow an athlete with splenomegaly that persists beyond seven to eight weeks to resume strenuous sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Routine ultrasonography is not needed in most patients; the decision to obtain imaging should be influenced by whether the patient is returning to contact sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common sense approach to resumption of training suggests that clinicians wait for resolution of objective symptoms as well as an improvement in the athlete's sense of well-being. For the first few days, athletes should train at reduced levels compared to their premorbid state, increasing activities gradually as tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Competitive athletes may not attain pre-illness levels of fitness for three or more months.
