Peripheral and basal predominant pulmonary fibrosis with histopathologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography findings consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) are diagnostic of the disease. Patients with IPF have a poor prognosis: multiple retrospective series demonstrate a median survival of two to three years from diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. However, data from clinical trials indicate this may be an underestimate of the true median survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Regardless, the individual clinical course is quite variable; some individuals have stable or slow progression, others demonstrate rapid progression, and still others develop episodic acute declines in lung function, known as &quot;acute exacerbations&quot; of IPF (AE-IPF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111393 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The following questions will be discussed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often does AE occur and what are the potential triggers?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the presenting signs and symptoms of an AE?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the current recommendations for evaluation and management of AE-IPF?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are typical outcomes for those who have an AE?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the future directions for research in AE?</p><p/><p>The risk factors, clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of AE-IPF will be reviewed here.

In 2007, the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Network (IPFnet) proposed a definition to better delineate a particular subset of these acute declines in function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A revised &quot;conceptual framework&quot; was proposed by an international working group in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The 2007 proposed definition of an &quot;acute exacerbation&quot; (AE) of IPF included all of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A previous or concurrent diagnosis of IPF</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deterioration within 30 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New bilateral ground glass opacities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consolidation on a background of reticular or honeycomb pattern consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of pulmonary infection by endotracheal aspiration or bronchoalveolar lavage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion of alternative causes including left heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or an identifiable cause of acute lung injury</p><p/><p>The 2016 revised criteria more accurately reflect today's knowledge of AE-IPF and should allow for better insights into the etiology, treatment, and outcomes of this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar to the definition in 2007, this newly proposed framework defines an AE as &quot;an acute, clinically significant respiratory deterioration characterized by evidence of new widespread alveolar abnormality,&quot; but does not set an exact 30 day limit for symptom onset and does not require exclusion of infection. The following diagnostic criteria are proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A known diagnosis of IPF (diagnosis may be made at the time of acute respiratory deterioration)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute worsening, &quot;typically less than one month's duration&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography of the chest with new bilateral ground glass opacification <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consolidation superimposed on a background of findings consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (bibasilar reticular opacities associated with honeycomb changes and traction bronchiectasis) (see <a href=\"#H3722378524\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure or fluid overload does not fully explain the worsening.</p><p/><p>Based on our understanding that these events may be triggered similar to acute lung injury in the non-IPF patient population, events are further classified into &quot;triggered&quot; (ie, postprocedure, drug toxicity, infection, aspiration) versus &quot;idiopathic&quot; (ie, no inciting event identified). This new classification will allow for a more complete picture of these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257415247\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the precise epidemiology has been problematic due to differences in diagnostic criteria, patient populations, baseline disease severity, follow-up time, and statistical methodology. Retrospective cohorts typically report a higher incidence and prevalence and may be hampered by bias to over-report acute deteriorations with a known cause (eg, pulmonary embolism, heart failure) as an AE-IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Prospective trials, on the other hand, may have missing data hampering accurate diagnosis of an AE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], as well as differing prevalence when reported by central reviewers versus the principal investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. A meta-analysis of seven multicenter prospective trials described an overall rate of 26.3 per 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/years</span> (range of 8.9 to 206.3 per 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/years)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As prospective clinical trials often exclude patients with advanced disease and comorbidities and as the risk of AE increases with severity of IPF, true rates of AE may be higher than the estimate from prospective trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1455056404\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While our current understanding of the pathophysiology of AE-IPF is limited, AE has clinical similarities to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both have increased oxygen needs, bilateral ground glass opacities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consolidation on imaging, and histopathology demonstrating diffuse alveolar damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. We know that there are multiple causes for ARDS and it is likely the same for those with AE-IPF. Further, IPF patients likely have maladaptive responses to lung injury, demonstrated by altered responses of IPF versus control fibroblasts to stimuli in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p>There are multiple examples of lung injury that subsequently develop into an AE-IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microaspiration of gastric contents</strong> &ndash; Microaspiration of gastric contents is a proposed risk factor for exacerbations and progression of IPF, based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials that demonstrated patients who received treatment for gastric reflux had slower decline of forced vital capacity (FVC), although there was no difference in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Nonthoracic surgical procedures have also been implicated in development of exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Potential mechanisms include administration of high concentrations of oxygen and volutrauma or barotrauma during mechanical ventilation. However, a causal relationship between IPF exacerbations and procedures is difficult to ascertain due to the retrospective analysis of the studies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advanced lung disease</strong> &ndash; Clinical factors of physiologically advanced IPF are associated with increased rates of AE, including: lower FVC, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and six-minute walk distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/25,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33,34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; A number of other potential contributors have been implicated, such as evidence of pulmonary hypertension, higher body mass index, coronary artery disease, and treatment with immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/10,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,34-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706062534\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with IPF, an acute exacerbation typically presents with shortness of breath or worsening exercise tolerance that develop over days to weeks, but generally less than one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/12,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,37</a>]. In a small series of 11 patients, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission averaged approximately 13 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

As identification and management of comorbidities is fundamental to the management of these patients, careful evaluation for potential contributing or alternate diagnoses is critical. We typically obtain complete blood and differential cell counts, brain natriuretic peptide, serial troponin tests, procalcitonin, and sensitive D-dimer. The role of serum markers of inflammation and lung injury is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/12,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,38</a>]. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are nonspecific and have not proved helpful. &#160;</p><p>Testing for potential lung infection typically includes blood cultures, urinary antigen assays for <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Legionella</em>, rapid influenza antigen test on respiratory secretions (in the appropriate season), and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for respiratory viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. The rapid influenza tests have a specificity of &gt;95 percent, but the sensitivity is only about 50 to 60 percent, so a negative result does not rule out influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR is the test of choice to diagnose influenza but requires a laboratory and a laboratory technician.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), with or without a rule-out pulmonary embolism protocol, is necessary for appropriate classification of the parenchymal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We have a very low threshold to perform CT pulmonary angiogram to exclude pulmonary embolism due to the significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism in IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].

Three HRCT distribution patterns have been described: peripheral, multifocal, and diffuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The main role is to identify and characterize any infection or malignancy. When performing a BAL for this purpose, we select a subsegment that appears to be involved based on the HRCT findings. BAL samples are sent for a broad spectrum of microbiologic tests, including stains and cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi, as well as multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses.

Among those with a primary diagnosis of IPF, the mortality rate was 49 percent regardless of the type of ventilatory support. In other studies, mortality has reached 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-exacerbations-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. If the patient chooses to pursue a trial of invasive mechanical ventilation, it may be helpful to outline parameters for discontinuing ventilatory support should the patient fail to improve. </p><p>Hopefully, all patients with IPF will have had the opportunity to have discussions about goals of care with their physicians prior to the onset of an AE, so the patient, family, and clinician can make decisions that are in concert with the patient's values and preferences.
