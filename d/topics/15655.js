However, healthcare providers may lack training in sexual minority health issues; medical schools provide limited training in sexual minority health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Clinicians who are neither comfortable with their ability nor willing to become sufficiently knowledgeable to provide high-quality care to sexual minority youth and youth with diverse sexual behaviors should refer them to more appropriate colleagues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>].</p><p>Similarly, clinicians with negative views of sexual minorities based on their cultural, religious, or personal bias should refer sexual minority youth to more appropriate colleagues. Sexual minorities routinely report discrimination, bias, and lack of trained providers when attempting to use the healthcare system, leading some to avoid health care altogether. In a 2005 survey, 22 percent of lesbians reported prior bad experience(s) with health care, 18 percent reported feeling afraid or embarrassed to talk about health issues, and 15 percent had specific concerns regarding discrimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>General principles outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine (SAHM), and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) for the care of sexual minority youth include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/3,4,9,12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9,12-16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide time and space for confidential conversations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess and build upon the youth's strengths</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approach sensitive topics respectfully; instead of lecturing, engage the youth in conversation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aim to foster healthy psychosexual development, integrated identity formation, and adaptive functioning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid assumptions (adolescents may not view themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual even though they are having sex with same-sex partners)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make the office welcoming to sexual minority youth (whether or not they have disclosed their orientation); this may encompass:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Staff who ensure privacy and confidentiality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Staff who ask patients for their preferred name and gender on intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Forms and questions that do not assume heterosexuality and permit nonbinary responses to questions about gender and orientation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provision of information and resources for sexual minority youth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A policy of openness, respect, and value of the individual patient's experience</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Waiting and exam room environments containing health promotion materials and resource information for sexual minority youth</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1018803229\"><span class=\"h2\">Privacy and confidentiality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Privacy and confidentiality are crucial when discussing potentially sensitive information with teens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Understanding legal requirements, institutional policies, and local laws can help providers educate teens about the difference between privacy and confidentiality and make responsible plans to protect sensitive health information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Privacy refers to an individual's ability to control the timing, amount, and circumstances under which information about oneself is disclosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Confidentiality pertains to the treatment of information once it has been disclosed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To illustrate with an example, a youth may have an explicit conversation with their medical provider about his or her sexual orientation and behaviors that can be kept private (ie, between the provider and the patient). However, information recorded in the medical record is available upon request by parent(s). Although most states provide adolescents with some measure of consent and confidentiality for testing and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), many states do not protect other reproductive health information (including sexual orientation and activity, pregnancy testing, contraception). Explicit assurance of privacy and confidentiality (and exceptions to privacy and confidentiality) regarding discussions and details of emerging sexuality helps teenagers understand what to expect and what types of sensitive information they may safely disclose to their healthcare provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Documentation of confidential information in the medical record is discussed separately.

Components of the adolescent psychosocial history that permit targeted anticipatory guidance and counseling for risk reduction often are compiled into acronyms that move from less sensitive to more sensitive topics, such as SHEADDSSS: <strong>S</strong>trengths, <strong>H</strong>ome, <strong>E</strong>ducation and employment, <strong>A</strong>ctivities, <strong>D</strong>rugs and tobacco, <strong>D</strong>epression and <strong>S</strong>uicidality, <strong>S</strong>afety, and <strong>S</strong>exuality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1043273533\"><span class=\"h2\">Strengths</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beginning with questions that identify the adolescent's strengths and assets (eg, supportive friends, academic achievement) may contribute to a nurturing provider-patient relationship, helping to build the adolescent's self-esteem, which may influence behavior and decrease risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/5,23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23-27</a>].

Parental caring, support, and positive response to their child's sexual orientation appear to be associated with better health outcomes for sexual minority youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Parental rejection is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including depression, suicide attempts, substance use, victimization, high-risk sexual behaviors, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and homelessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p>It is important to ask, and not make assumptions, about parent and family members' support and acceptance of the individual youth and their views on sexual minorities. Asking directly about perceived and explicit support or homophobia allows a provider to understand the family milieu and resources. Asking about methods of conflict resolution and communication within the home may help the provider to understand the potential for violence if the youth discloses an alternative sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877546137\"><span class=\"h2\">Education and employment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When asking about education and employment in the psychosocial history of sexual minority youth, it is particularly important to ask about victimization and absenteeism related to victimization. For example, &quot;What is the general attitude towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender issues at your school?&quot;, &quot;Are you being teased, bullied, or harassed at school?&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Many sexual minority youth experience discrimination and victimization at school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. School victimization due to perceived sexual minority status has been associated with social isolation, low self-esteem, depression, and suicidality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. Identification of a negative school environment and knowing what resources are available at school are necessary to intervene. (See <a href=\"#H877546161\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns#H80246789\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual minority youth: Epidemiology and health concerns&quot;, section on 'School'</a>.)</p><p>In a 2011 national survey of 8584 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students (13 to 20 years), 60 percent of students who were harassed or assaulted in school did not report the incident to school staff, believing little to no action would be taken or the situation could become worse if reported; 37 percent of students who did report an incident said that no action was taken in response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Fewer sexual minority resources were available to middle school than high schools students and students who attended public or religious school (versus <span class=\"nowrap\">private/nonreligious</span> schools), and schools located in the South, Midwest, small towns, or rural areas.</p><p>For many sexual minority youth, experience of discrimination and bias in school can lead to anticipation of discrimination in the workplace and may limit perceived career opportunities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Sexual minority status may be less important than prior experience of bias. In a survey of 119 sexual minority adults, those who experienced high levels of discrimination reported that sexual orientation negatively affected their career opportunities satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-primary-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Lack of perceived employment opportunities may lead sexual minority youth to resort to providing sex in exchange for money, housing, or drugs, increasing their risk of victimization and STIs.

Pelvic examination may be difficult and uncomfortable for individuals with gender dysphoria. It is important for the clinician to discuss the process and procedure for cervical cancer screening with asserted male patients. Involving the patient in the plans for the pelvic examination demonstrates sensitivity to gender dysphoria and allows the patient to have some control over his care. Use of a darkened room, distraction techniques, and anxiolytics may be helpful.
