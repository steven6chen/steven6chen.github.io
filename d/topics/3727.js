It is a disorder characterized by ischemic necrosis of the intestinal mucosa, which is associated with inflammation, invasion of enteric gas forming organisms, and dissection of gas into the muscularis and portal venous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although early recognition and aggressive treatment of this disorder has improved clinical outcomes, NEC accounts for substantial long-term morbidity in survivors of neonatal intensive care, particularly in premature very low birth weight infants (birth weight below 1500 g).</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of NEC are reviewed here. The pathology, pathogenesis, management, and prevention of this disorder are discussed separately.

The overall rate of NEC was about 7 percent. Rates were inversely related to BW as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BW between 401 to 750 g &ndash; 11.5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BW between 751 to 1000 g &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BW between 1001 to 1250 g &ndash; 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BW between 1251 to 1500 g &ndash; 4 percent</p><p/><p>Although unadjusted rates of NEC varied among the 362 NICUs, there were no significant differences when risk was adjusted for confounding variables. However, one limitation of this study is that it most likely included infants with spontaneous intestinal perforation, which may alter these rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intestinal perforation of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar trends were observed in two more current studies from the United Kingdom and Canada:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey from the United Kingdom of 10,946 admissions to the NICU during summer and winter study periods in 2005 and 2006, the reported prevalence rate was 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The risk of NEC increased with decreasing BW and GA with a 14 percent prevalence for infants with BW &lt;1000 g and a GA &lt;26 weeks. Males and females are affected equally. NEC affects black and white infants more than Hispanic infants, but the racial patterns reflect the populations served by neonatal centers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based Canadian study of 16,669 preterm infants (gestational age &lt;33 weeks) admitted to 25 NICUs, the incidence of NEC was 5.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Reported mortality rates range from 15 to 30 percent and also are inversely related to gestational age and birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The estimated yearly infant death rate in the United States from 1979 to 1992 was 12.4 deaths per 100,000 live births. The death rate from NEC was highest in black VLBW male infants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Term infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the majority of infants with NEC are born prematurely, approximately 13 percent of cases occur in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Term infants who develop NEC typically have a preexisting illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. This was illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, predisposing conditions were identified in 16 of 26 term infants with NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among these, 6 had congenital heart disease and 10 had other disorders, including sepsis, seizures, hypoglycemia, severe intrauterine growth restriction, hypercoagulable state, gastroschisis, and congenital herpes infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, a preexisting condition was found in all 30 infants greater than 36 weeks gestation with NEC cared for in a regional multiple-center healthcare system from 2001 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Diagnoses included congenital heart disease (n = 8), respiratory distress (n = 8), sepsis (n = 4), birth anoxia (n = 4), and polycythemia (n = 2). None of the patients were exclusively breastfed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;, section on 'Human milk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series of 39 term patients (gestational age &ge;37 weeks) born between 1990 and 2012, 15 infants were born to mothers with prenatal risk factors (eg, illegal substance use, intrapartum infection, maternal diabetes, and pregnancy-induced hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Two-thirds of the cohort also had perinatal and neonatal disorders including infection (n = 25), hypoxic event (n = 11), congenital heart disease (n = 9), and genetic disorders (n = 9). Overall mortality was 18 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of premature infants who develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are healthy, feeding well, and growing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A change in feeding tolerance with gastric retention is a frequent early sign. The timing of the onset of symptoms varies and appears to be inversely related to gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>]. Overall, 25 percent of cases present later than 30 days after birth. The median age at onset in infants with a gestational age of less than 26 weeks was 23 days, and for those with a gestational age of greater than 31 weeks, the median age at onset was 11 days.</p><p>The clinical presentation of NEC consists of systemic and abdominal signs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic signs are nonspecific and include apnea, respiratory failure, lethargy, poor feeding, or temperature instability. Hypotension resulting from septic shock may be present in the most severe cases. Twenty to 30 percent of infants with NEC have associated bacteremia, which may contribute to these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-bacterial-sepsis-in-the-preterm-infant-less-than34-weeks-gestation#H462631989\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of bacterial sepsis in the preterm infant (&lt;34 weeks gestation)&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal signs include distention, gastric retention (residual milk in the stomach before a feeding), tenderness, vomiting, diarrhea, rectal bleeding (hematochezia), and bilious drainage from enteral feeding tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Bell staging criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Bell staging criteria provide a uniform definition of NEC based upon the severity of systemic, intestinal, and radiographic findings, and are the most commonly used criteria in practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54166 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>]. These definitions are useful in comparing cases and studies; however, treatment is directed at the clinical signs rather than the particular stage of NEC. Each advancing stage includes the characteristics of the previous stage plus additional findings due to increasing severity of the disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I, or suspected NEC, is characterized by nonspecific systemic signs, such as temperature instability, apnea, and lethargy. Abdominal signs include increased gastric residuals, abdominal distention, emesis, and heme-positive stool. Abdominal radiographs may be normal or show dilation of the bowel consistent with mild ileus. Although therapy does not change, stage I cases are further divided by the absence (stage IA) or presence (stage IB) of grossly bloody stools. However, there is disagreement among experts in the field whether or not the entity described as Bells stage I is actually necrotizing enterocolitis, or nonspecific feeding <span class=\"nowrap\">intolerance/ileus</span> of the preterm infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II, or proven NEC, encompasses the signs of stage I plus absent bowel sounds with or without abdominal tenderness. Abdominal tenderness is present, and some infants have cellulitis of the abdominal wall or a mass in the right lower quadrant. Infants with stage IIA are mildly ill, whereas those with stage IIB NEC are moderately ill and also have mild metabolic acidosis and thrombocytopenia. Abdominal radiograph findings include intestinal dilation, ileus, pneumatosis intestinalis, and ascites. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal radiography'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III, or advanced NEC, is the most severe form. In stage IIIA, the bowel is intact, whereas stage IIIB is characterized by bowel perforation visualized as a pneumoperitoneum on the abdominal radiograph. Infants with advanced NEC are critically ill. In addition to the signs of less severe stages, they typically have hypotension, bradycardia, severe apnea, and signs of peritonitis (eg, abdominal distention and marked tenderness). Laboratory signs include a combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis, neutropenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).</p><p/><p>In about one-third of cases, NEC is suspected but not confirmed (stage I), and symptoms resolve gradually in these infants. In 25 to 40 percent of cases, the progression of NEC is fulminant with signs of peritonitis and sepsis, and the rapid development of DIC and shock (stage III).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is based on the presence of the characteristic clinical features of abdominal distention and rectal bleeding (heme-positive or grossly bloody stools), and the abdominal radiographic finding of pneumatosis intestinalis.</p><p>Assessment of infants with suspected NEC includes abdominal imaging, blood studies, stool analysis, and sepsis evaluation. Although the results of this evaluation often are nonspecific, certain findings are supportive of the diagnosis of NEC, and in the case of abdominal imaging (ie, pneumatosis intestinalis), may be diagnostic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic studies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal radiographs confirm the diagnosis of NEC and follow the progression of the disease. Of note, although abdominal radiography is usually useful in making the diagnosis of NEC, when there are equivocal radiographic findings, treatment decisions should be based upon clinical suspicion.</p><p>Abdominal radiographs are obtained in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In infants with more advanced illness in whom pneumoperitoneum is suspected, films also are taken in the supine cross-table lateral view or in the lateral decubitus position with the left side down to detect free air in the abdomen. After the initial evaluation, we obtain serial radiographs to follow the course of the disease, usually every 8 to 12 hours during the first few days or until the infant improves.</p><p>The following characteristic radiographic features are seen in the majority of infants with suspected NEC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78676\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78676 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal gas pattern with dilated loops of bowel that is consistent with ileus, and is typically seen in the early stages of NEC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumatosis intestinalis, the hallmark of NEC, appears as bubbles of gas in the small bowel wall, and is seen in most patients with stages II and III NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumoperitoneum typically appears when bowel perforation occurs in patients with IIIB NEC. A substantial amount of intraperitoneal air may result in the &quot;football&quot; sign on a supine radiograph. This sign consists of a large hypolucent area in the central abdomen with markings from the falciform ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sentinel loops, a loop of bowel that remains in fixed position, is suggestive of necrotic bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perforation in the absence of pneumatosis intestinalis.</p><p/><p>Portal venous gas (PVG) had been thought to be a predictor of poor outcome and an indication for surgical intervention. However, subsequent data do NOT support these assumptions. This was illustrated in a prospective study of 194 infants with NEC treated at a single center from 1991 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There was NO difference in survival rates between those patients with PVG and those without (17 versus 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Of the infants with PVG, those who were treated medically had a higher survival rate than those treated surgically (91 versus 74 percent).</p><p>Radiological findings may vary by gestational age. This was illustrated in one observational series of 202 infants with NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although intramural gas was detected in all infants &ge;37 weeks gestation with NEC, it was only present in 29 percent of those &le;26 weeks gestation. In addition, portal venous gas was more common in infants &ge;37 weeks compared with those &le;26 weeks gestation (47 versus 10 percent). Thus, abdominal radiography may not be as helpful in the most immature infants. Particularly in these infants, treatment decisions should be based upon clinical suspicion as confirmatory radiographic findings may not be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although we currently rely on radiographs, abdominal ultrasonography has been increasingly used in the diagnosis of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. The sonographic appearance of bowel wall with a central echogenic focus and a hypoechoic rim (the pseudo-kidney sign) may indicate necrotic bowel and imminent perforation. Ultrasonography also can detect intermittent gas bubbles in liver parenchyma and the portal venous system that are not detected by radiographs. Free gas, focal fluid collections, and increased bowel wall thickness and echogenicity are associated with more severe NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,29</a>].</p><p>Color Doppler ultrasonography has also been used to diagnose NEC. In a small study, color Doppler ultrasonography was more sensitive than abdominal radiography in detecting bowel necrosis and alterations in bowel wall perfusion as confirmed at laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal radiologic modality to confirm NEC in at-risk infants in all settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Contrast enema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast enemas are NOT recommended if NEC is suspected, as it may result in bowel perforation with extravasation of contrast material into the peritoneum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although blood tests are not used in the diagnostic and staging criteria for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), laboratory findings may support the diagnosis and aid in the management of infants with NEC. In particular, low platelet count, metabolic acidosis, and an increasing serum glucose are associated with NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count &ndash; A complete blood count and differential are performed when NEC is suspected. Alterations in the white blood count are nonspecific, although an absolute neutrophil count of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/microL</span> is more commonly observed in patients with NEC and is associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/1,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33</a>]. Thrombocytopenia is a frequent finding and can result in significant bleeding. In the early course of NEC, declining platelet counts correlate with necrotic bowel and worsening disease, whereas a subsequent rise in platelet counts often signals improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulation studies &ndash; Coagulation studies are not ordered routinely, but should be obtained if the infant has thrombocytopenia or bleeding, because disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a frequent finding in infants with severe NEC. DIC is confirmed by a decreased platelet count, prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, decreased serum factor V and fibrinogen concentrations, and increased fibrin split products (D-dimer). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum chemistries &ndash; Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and pH are routinely measured. An arterial blood gas analysis is performed in infants with signs of respiratory compromise. Electrolyte abnormalities often are nonspecific. However, persistence of hyponatremia (serum sodium levels of less than 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> increasing glucose levels, and metabolic acidosis are suggestive of necrotic bowel or sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Some clinicians monitor serial lactate levels to monitor metabolic acidosis as indicators of disease progression and healing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other nonspecific findings in infants with NEC include increased levels of C-reactive protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], lysosomal acid hydrolase, and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Sepsis evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sepsis evaluation (blood culture, and if indicated, cerebral spinal fluid culture) is performed when NEC is suspected because sepsis is a common concomitant finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

These organisms are identified by stool cultures, although their causative role in NEC is uncertain. Viral enteritis of infancy is characterized by frequent and sometimes bloody stools, abdominal distention, and secondary sepsis. There may be a clustering of cases within a single unit. Common pathogens include rotavirus and enterovirus.

It occurs primarily in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g) similar to NEC. It is distinguished from NEC by the clinical findings of hypotension and abdominal distension, with the classical bluish discoloration of the abdominal wall in the absence of abdominal wall erythema, crepitus, and induration commonly seen in NEC, and the absence of NEC radiographic findings of pneumatosis intestinalis, transient thickening of the intestinal wall, and fixed dilated small bowel loops. It typically occurs within the first week of life and is independent of feeding (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intestinal perforation of the newborn&quot;</a>), as discussed above, is not associated with pneumatosis, occurs within the first week of life, and is independent of feeding.

It occurs in 1 to 3 per 1000 live births. The incidence decreases with increasing gestational age and birth weight (BW), and is about 6 to 7 percent in very low birth weight infants (BW less than 1500 g). Term infants who develop NEC usually have a preexisting illness, such as congenital heart disease or sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NEC primarily occurs in healthy, growing, and feeding premature infants. It presents with both nonspecific systemic signs (eg, apnea, respiratory failure, poor feeding, lethargy, or temperature instability) and abdominal signs (eg, distension, gastric retention, tenderness, vomiting, rectal bleeding, and diarrhea). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Bell staging criteria defines the different stages of NEC based upon the severity of clinical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54166 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Bell staging criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of NEC is based upon the presence of the characteristic clinical features of abdominal distention and rectal bleeding (hematochezia), and the abdominal radiographic finding of pneumatosis intestinalis. At times, radiographic findings may be equivocal and treatment decision should be based upon clinical suspicion and findings. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Results of laboratory evaluation, including blood studies and stool analysis, are nonspecific, but may be supportive of the diagnosis of NEC. In particular, low platelet count, metabolic acidosis, and a heme-positive stool are associated with NEC. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of NEC includes other conditions that cause rectal bleeding, abdominal distension, or intestinal perforation. These include spontaneous intestinal perforation of the newborn, infectious enterocolitis, and the usually benign diagnoses of pneumatosis coli and anal fissures. NEC is differentiated from these conditions by the abdominal radiographic finding of pneumatosis intestinalis.
