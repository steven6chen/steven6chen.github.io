The sinuses are hollow areas in the bones of the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75045 \">figure 1</a>). They have a thin lining that normally makes a small amount of mucus. When this lining gets infected, it swells and makes extra mucus. This causes symptoms.</p><p>Sinusitis can happen when a child gets sick with a cold. The germs causing the cold can also infect the sinuses. Many times, the child seems to be getting over the cold but then gets sinusitis and begins to feel sick again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7405618\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of sinusitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms of sinusitis in children include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stuffy or blocked nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discharge from the nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or swelling in the face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad breath</p><p/><p>Most of the time, symptoms start to improve in 7 to 10 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7405624\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take my child to the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Take your child to the doctor or nurse if any of the following is true:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child has had a stuffy, runny, or blocked nose for more than 10 days, and it is not getting better.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child has fever higher than 102.2&ordm;F (39&ordm;C), yellow or green discharge from the nose for 3 or 4 days in a row, and looks sick.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child's symptoms get better at first but then get worse.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, sinusitis can lead to serious problems. Take your child to the doctor or nurse <strong>right away</strong> (do not wait 10 days) if he or she has any of these symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever higher than 102.2&ordm;F (39&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden and severe pain in the face and head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing or seeing double</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling or redness around one or both eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff neck</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7405630\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To reduce your child's symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your child an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) to reduce the pain. But <strong>never</strong> give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to any child younger than 18 years old. In children, aspirin can cause a life-threatening condition called Reye syndrome. When giving your child acetaminophen or other over-the-counter medicines, never give more than the recommended dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinse your child's nose and sinuses with salt water a few times a day &ndash; Ask your doctor or nurse about the best way to do this.</p><p/><p>You should <strong>not</strong> give your child cold or allergy medicines for sinusitis. Those medicines could make your child's symptoms worse. Plus, cold medicines are not safe for children younger than 6.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4498374\"><span class=\"h1\">How is sinusitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, sinusitis does not need to be treated with antibiotic medicines. This is because most sinusitis is caused by viruses &ndash; not bacteria &ndash; and antibiotics do not kill viruses. Many children get over sinus infections without antibiotics.</p><p>Some children with sinusitis do need treatment with antibiotics. If your child's symptoms have not improved after 10 days, ask the doctor if he or she needs antibiotics. If your child is put on antibiotics, make sure he or she takes them exactly as directed and finishes the whole prescription.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7405642\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child does not get better with treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child's symptoms do not start get better after 3 days of treatment, talk with his or her doctor or nurse. Your child might need a different antibiotic. If that doesn't work, the doctor or nurse might order other tests, but that is not usually needed. Tests to figure out why a child still has symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan or other imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the nose and sinuses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test to look inside the sinuses &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a thin tube with a camera on the end into the nose and up into the sinuses.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7405648\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-sinus-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute sinusitis (sinus infection) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
