The goal remains to find the best combination of immunosuppressive agents that optimizes allograft survival by preventing acute rejection while limiting drug toxicities. Although data from adult renal transplantation trials are used to help guide management decisions in pediatric patients, immunosuppression often must be modified because of the unique clinical effects of some of these agents in children, including their impact on growth and development.</p><p>An overview of immunosuppression regimens used in children undergoing renal transplantation will be reviewed here. Additional issues concerning transplantation in children as well as detailed discussions of immunosuppressive issues in renal transplantation common to both children and adults are presented separately.

In children who undergo renal transplantation, immunosuppression is divided into the three following categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction therapy &ndash; Intensive immunosuppression administered during the perioperative period to prevent acute rejection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance therapy &ndash; Immunosuppressive therapy to prevent acute rejection after the perioperative period</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of acute rejection &ndash; Immunosuppressive therapy to treat acute rejection</p><p/><p>In general, immunosuppression should be highest during the first three months after transplantation when the risk of acute rejection and allograft loss is greatest. Immunosuppression is tapered slowly to a maintenance level by 6 to 12 months post-transplantation.</p><p>The immunosuppression that is used varies among transplant centers and has evolved with the development of new medications. In addition, many centers now consider the following patient-specific factors in choosing which immunosuppressive medications to administer to the transplant recipient. In general, more intensive immunosuppression is selected for patients who are at greater risk for allograft rejection or loss.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient sensitized?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is this the first kidney transplant or a retransplant?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many acute rejection episodes has the patient had?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching or mismatching? (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA matching and graft survival in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the risk of recurrent disease?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is this an ABO incompatible transplant?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35218101\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION IMMUNOSUPPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction therapy is used to prevent T-cell activation and is administered during the perioperative period when the risk of acute rejection is highest. It generally includes the use of antibodies directed against T-cell antigens in combination with conventional agents. In adults, a large number of controlled randomized trials and meta-analyses indicate that induction therapy consisting of biologic antibodies plus conventional immunosuppressive therapy (eg, corticosteroids, antimetabolites, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcineurin inhibitor) is superior to conventional agent therapy alone in reducing renal allograft rejection and failure. In children, data are limited on the optimal induction therapy that prevents allograft rejection and failure while minimizing serious adverse effects (eg, infections and malignancies). As a result, the choice of induction therapy for children in pediatric renal transplantation remains controversial and dependent upon center preference based on patient factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'Overview of our approach to induction therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2175257\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody induction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody induction agents include specific antilymphocyte or interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antibodies (ie, antagonist) that target T-cells. Data from adult trials have demonstrated that induction therapy consisting of biologic antibodies plus conventional immunosuppressive agent therapy is superior to conventional agent therapy alone in reducing kidney allograft rejection and allograft failure.</p><p>In contrast, to date, no controlled trials in pediatric renal transplant recipients have verified the benefit of using induction antibody therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunosuppression-in-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In fact, a large controlled trial of OKT3 induction versus induction with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> in pediatric kidney transplantation showed no additional benefit to antibody induction over the use of cyclosporine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunosuppression-in-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, observational data from the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) consistently show a beneficial effect of prophylactic anti T-cell antibody therapy in pediatric renal transplant allograft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunosuppression-in-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These results are subject to confounding variables such as center effect, and the use of several different types of T-cell antibody, and other nonbiologic agents. Based upon the results from the adult trials and the NAPRTCS registry, antibody induction therapy should be used in conjunction with conventional immunosuppression in pediatric renal transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, results from two large prospective randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients showed induction therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">basiliximab</a> (anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody [IL-2R antibodies]) in patients with low to medium immunological risk on maintenance therapy (consisting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a> in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azathioprine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [MMF]) did not lead to a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of acute rejection episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunosuppression-in-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>As a result, there is presently no consensus amongst pediatric renal transplantation centers regarding the use and regimen for immunosuppressive induction therapy. Although the current choice of induction therapy is center and patient dependent, considerations in choosing the appropriate agent include the efficacy in the patient population (eg, high-risk or low-risk for graft loss recipients) and the side effect profile.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consistent evidence that shows induction therapy is beneficial or cost-effective in low to medium risk patients who receive triple therapy with calcineurin inhibitors in conventional doses, MMF, and glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction therapy appears to produce the greatest benefits in groups at high risk for allograft rejection. These high-risk groups include African Americans, recipients of kidneys with prolonged cold ischemia time, and those at high immunologic risk, particularly individuals who are presensitized. The sequential induction regimen of thymoglobulin or IL-2R blocking antibodies followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a> is recommended in these high-risk groups.</p><p/><p>A center may opt to use an IL-2 receptor antagonist for induction in the unsensitized recipient, but use antilymphocyte antibody therapy in a highly sensitized patient or a patient who has had a previous failed transplant.</p><p>Trends in induction therapy have changed over time with a shift away from the polyclonal and monoclonal antilymphocyte antibody preparations towards the IL-2 receptor antagonists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59479\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59479 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunosuppression-in-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, this trend may be reversed if new data continue to show a lack of additional benefit from IL-2 receptor antagonists.

Although there were no differences in the incidences of chronic allograft nephropathy and Epstein-Barr virus lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunosuppression-in-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], the incidence of acute rejection was noted to be lower in the group treated with rATG-thymoglobulin. This result may be due to the rATG-thymoglobulin group being a more recently treated cohort, and the outcomes of kidney transplantation have generally improved with time. However, clinical trial in adults also demonstrated lower acute rejection rates in patients who received rATG-thymoglobulin compared with those treated with ATGAM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults#H2836944811\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'rATG-Thymoglobulin versus Atgam'</a>.)</p><p>Two studies from single centers that used rATG-thymoglobulin induction in combination with steroid minimization, calcineurin inhibitor, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil maintenance immunosuppression reported good recipient and graft survival and comparable rejection rates to historic steroid-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunosuppression-in-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Currently, few pediatric transplant recipients receive OKT3 for induction therapy because there is no clear benefit of OKT3 compared with other antilymphocyte antibody preparations and it has significant adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunosuppression-in-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/2,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,13</a>]. This includes the &quot;first-dose reaction,&quot; which occurs in more than two-thirds of patients, and consists of fever, chills, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, and occasionally pulmonary edema.

With the development of new agents, the focus of the transplant community is to establish regimens that maintain excellent allograft survival rates, but with fewer toxicities (eg, infection, nephrotoxicity, malignancy, cosmetic effects, and growth impairment). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcomes-of-renal-transplantation-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcomes of renal transplantation in children&quot;, section on 'Effect of immunosuppressive regimens'</a>.)</p><p>Maintenance immunosuppression regimens generally consist of a combination of agents with different mechanisms of action.

Steroid resistant, severe, or recurrent episodes are often treated with lymphocyte-depleting antibodies. In some cases, in patients who have rejection episodes and have been adherent to their maintenance immunosuppression, alternative immunosuppressive strategies should be considered in addition to treatment of the acute rejection.

It generally includes the use of antibodies directed against T-cell antigens in combination with conventional immunosuppressive therapy (ie, corticosteroids, antimetabolites, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcineurin inhibitors).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance therapy &ndash; Immunosuppressive therapy to prevent acute rejection after the perioperative period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of acute rejection &ndash; Immunosuppressive therapy to treat acute rejection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To date, no controlled trials in pediatric renal transplant recipients have verified the benefit of using induction antibody therapy. However, based upon the results from trials in adult renal transplantation recipients and registry data from the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies, we recommend that antibody induction therapy should be used in conjunction with conventional immunosuppression in pediatric renal transplant recipients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The use of biological agents (ie, antilymphocyte antibodies and anti-interleukin 2 receptor antibodies) as induction therapy is controversial, and the current choice of induction therapy is center dependent. Considerations in choosing the appropriate biologic agent include the efficacy in the patient population (eg, high-risk or low-risk for graft loss recipients), whether they are on corticosteroid or calcineurin inhibitor minimization protocols, and the side effect profile of the selected immunosuppressive agent(s). (See <a href=\"#H35218101\" class=\"local\">'Induction immunosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the administration of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy to all pediatric renal transplant recipients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Maintenance immunosuppression regimens generally consist of a combination of agents with different mechanisms of action. The most common classes of immunosuppressive agents include corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>), antimetabolites (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil), and calcineurin inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a>). However, these drugs are associated with significant side effects, particularly prednisone and the calcineurin inhibitors. As a result, ongoing trials are directed towards identifying regimens that successfully withdraw or minimize the use of these drugs to reduce the adverse effects of these medications without increasing the risk of acute rejection. (See <a href=\"#H35218143\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance immunosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the administration of intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> to patients with acute allograft rejection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is at present no consensus for an established immunosuppressive regimen following renal transplantation in children. The immunosuppressive regimen used at Seattle Children's Hospital for patients is as follows. (See <a href=\"#H784212492\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Induction therapy includes rATG-thymoglobulin (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given intraoperatively. The number of daily doses (up to seven) is dependent on risk of graft loss (see <a href=\"#H294488932\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Methylprednisolone</a> is given before each rATG-thymoglobulin dose, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum 1 gram) before the first dose, and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> prior to each subsequent dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance therapy includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (daily dose of 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The initial treatment of a T cell-mediated acute is a three day course of pulse intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> maximum dose 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> followed by a slow taper of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>.
