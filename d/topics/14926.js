Thirty-five blood group systems are recognized by the International Society for Blood Transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The major blood group systems with clinical significance are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106849\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106849 \">table 1</a>) and discussed in more detail below.

In cases in which a single nucleotide difference results in two different antigens, the convention is for these to be designated with a superscript (eg, Fy<sup>a</sup>, Fy<sup>b</sup>). Every blood group antigen belongs to a blood group system. Three hundred forty-two red cell antigens are recognized by the International Society for Blood Transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RBC phenotype</strong> &ndash; RBC phenotype refers to the combination of antigens on the RBC surface or to the process of detecting these antigens by serologic testing using reagent antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RBC genotype</strong> &ndash; RBC genotype refers to the genetic sequences at the loci for blood group antigens or to the process of predicting these antigens through DNA testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Null phenotype</strong> &ndash; Null phenotype for a blood group system (possible for most blood group systems) refers to the absence of antigens for that system. The null phenotype may be due to inactivating mutations that prevent transcription of the gene product necessary for antigen expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1126436680\"><span class=\"h1\">SETTINGS IN WHICH BLOOD GROUPS PLAY A ROLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood type is used clinically in pretransfusion testing, <span class=\"nowrap\">organ/tissue</span> transplantation, evaluation of transfusion reaction, and determining the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Some hemolytic anemias are associated with certain blood group antigens. </p><p>Some blood group antigens (or their absence) appear to have been selected during evolution, such as antigen phenotypes that micro-organisms cannot use to enter the RBC. Additional information about historical contexts and specific blood groups is presented in several review articles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1010190102\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood component transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incompatibility between a blood transfusion recipient and donor is a cause of potentially serious transfusion reactions. Routine pretransfusion testing for RBC, platelet, and plasma transfusion typically involves determination of ABO and Rh(D) type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106849\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106849 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RBCs</strong> &ndash; For RBC transfusion, the patient&rsquo;s RBCs are typed and the patient&rsquo;s plasma is tested for the presence of antibodies that could cause hemolysis of the transfused blood, such as those directed against antigens in the ABO, Rh, Duffy, Kidd, Kell, MNS, and Lutheran blood groups. Antibodies to additional RBC antigens may be detected during compatibility testing (crossmatching) with a specific unit of blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion#H27221955\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;, section on 'Pretransfusion testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Platelets</strong> &ndash; Platelets express ABO (but not Rh) antigens on their surface; these ABO antigens are absorbed from the plasma onto the platelet surface. Rarely, an individual may have platelets that express high levels of ABO antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Some transfusion services monitor platelet transfusions to limit the amount of ABO incompatible plasma administered with the platelet product, and some avoid giving platelets with high titers of anti-A and anti-B to A and B individuals. When Rh(D)-negative women of childbearing age are given platelet transfusions, platelets from Rh(D)-negative donors are used in order to avoid potential co-transfusion of a small amount of Rh(D)-positive RBCs in the platelet product. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H558381883\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'ABO, Rh, and HLA matching'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma</strong> &ndash; Plasma contains antibodies to ABO antigens. Plasma for transfusion can either be from a donor who shares the same ABO type as the recipient (ABO identical or ABO matched) or it can be ABO compatible (eg, patient with type A blood can receive plasma from a donor who is type A or type AB, neither of which will contain antibodies to A). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H24873625\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'ABO matching'</a>.) </p><p/><p>We advise that any individual with a history of a clinically significant antibody should receive blood that lacks the relevant antigen, whether or not the antibody is detectable on subsequent testing. The rationale is that some antibodies may decrease to undetectable levels but may be boosted upon re-exposure to the antigen. Antibodies to Kidd blood group antigens (anti-Jk<sup>a</sup> and anti-Jk<sup>b</sup>) are one setting in which this phenomenon is seen. (See <a href=\"#H60\" class=\"local\">'Kidd antibodies'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3402390765\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic cell and solid organ transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoietic cells can be transplanted from a donor of any blood type to a recipient of any blood type, regardless of compatibility, because the donor hematopoietic cells will give rise to a new blood type and a new immune system that are compatible with each other. Measures to reduce hemolysis and improve platelet survival during the immediate post-transplant period (when donor and recipient blood cells and circulating antibodies in the plasma are both present) are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99896 \">table 2</a>) and discussed separately.

Routine transplantation practice involves the use of organs that are ABO identical with the recipient. Compatibility for other (non-ABO) blood group antigens is not performed. In certain cases non-ABO identical transplants can be performed (eg, group O donor organ transplanted to group A, B, or AB recipient). </p><p>In selected cases, transplantation of an ABO incompatible organ can be performed (eg, from a living kidney donor; for fulminant hepatic failure), often using a desensitization or immunosuppression protocol. This subject and other exceptions are discussed separately.

ABO and Rh are generally the most familiar, because they define the blood type. The ABO and Lewis, P1, and I antigens are most similar to each other structurally because they are formed from small carbohydrates on glycoprotein or glycolipid surfaces. These carbohydrate epitopes are created by post-translational modifications through the actions of glycosyltransferase enzymes. The tissue expression of these antigens is thus controlled by variable expression of the glycoproteins as well as the glycosyltransferase enzymes. In contrast, other major blood group antigens, including Rh, are highly immunogenic proteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">ABO blood group system</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2769413149\"><span class=\"h3\">ABO antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/616093&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWMR4G7aO+HJ5IswLYEKZOwKXwbzPouzUm3W8e1UOqpVN&amp;TOPIC_ID=7924\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ABO blood group system</a> is responsible for four major RBC phenotypes: A, B, O, and AB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106849\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106849 \">table 1</a>). The distribution of phenotypes varies by ethnicity; an example of estimated frequencies in a United States population is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106852 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>The A and B antigens are defined by the immunodominant sugars (n-acetylgalactosamine for the &quot;A&quot; antigen and D-galactose for the &quot;B&quot; antigen); these are carbohydrates that are added on top of the carbohydrate backbone known as the &quot;H&quot; antigen. The glycosyltransferase enzymes responsible for adding these sugars are encoded by the <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/110300&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWIKrH2Yngv4VJSss1VE/N6dmDvt6shlp1cDrSDNzZlD0&amp;TOPIC_ID=7924\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ABO</a> gene. In group O individuals, a variant in the <em>ABO</em> gene causes a frameshift and production of a protein incapable of modifying the H antigen. In A and B individuals, one or more sugars are added onto the H backbone depending on the combination of alleles inherited.</p><p>The H antigen is a fucosyltransferase encoded by the <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/211100&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWAFmExAUY6g02WAY90umIDYp+Vn42EeNfnql9lAP8ORi&amp;TOPIC_ID=7924\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FUT1</a> gene. There are several unusual phenotypes within the ABO system resulting from a lack or alteration of fucosyltransferase activity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bombay phenotype</strong> &ndash; In the <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/616754&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWEET7cBOBRlQ5drxe6vV6e06HZeTH2Vq3a/m+1eTxenI&amp;TOPIC_ID=7924\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Bombay phenotype</a>, fucosyltransferase activity is lacking. Since the H antigen is required for the addition of the A and B antigens, A and B also cannot be produced, regardless of the ABO genotype. In these individuals, RBCs lack A, B, and H antigens, and antibodies to A, B, and H are produced. As a result, these individuals are at risk for a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) if transfused with RBCs of any ABO type other than Bombay. Crossmatching of blood from an individual with this phenotype will show hemolysis with all group O screening cells and panel cells, alerting the blood bank to the need for further investigation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Bombay phenotype is found almost exclusively in individuals from India, with an incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10,000</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

If an individual with the Bombay phenotype needs blood in an acute emergency and blood from a Bombay phenotype donor is not available, artificial blood could be used instead.

Weak subgroups are relatively rare, but when encountered they may make determination of ABO type uncertain. In such cases, it is advisable to transfuse group O RBCs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired B antigen</strong> &ndash; In some individuals, certain bacteria (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em> K-12, <em>Clostridium tertium</em>) can produce and release a deacetylase enzyme into the circulation that converts the A1 antigen into a B-like antigen. Thus, individuals with A1 (which accounts for 80 percent of A phenotypes) are at risk for the acquired B antigen phenotype in the setting of expansion of these bacterial populations, as may occur in the setting of a necrotic tumor or bowel obstruction. Once the infection is successfully treated, the patient's ABO group will return to group A1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Individuals with the acquired B antigen should never be transfused with AB or B blood, because their naturally occurring anti-B alloantibody (see <a href=\"#H4055399491\" class=\"local\">'ABO antibodies'</a> below) is likely to clear the transfused cells from the circulation at a rapid rate.

When the infection is successfully treated, the patient's I antigen reverts to normal and the previously increased levels of anti-I destroy a portion of the patient's own RBCs until the antibody level has diminished.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In rare instances of patients with autoantibodies to I with an increased thermal range (ie, &gt;31&deg;C), a blood warmer may be required. The patient's core body temperature should be maintained as close to 37&deg;C as possible in order to avoid cold-induced exacerbation of hemolysis.

These include M and N, which are located on glycophorin A; and S and s, located on glycophorin B, as well as many high prevalence antigens, the most notable of which is U. <em>MN</em> and <em>Ss</em> are closely linked, and antigens in this system generally will be inherited together.</p><p>Glycophorin A and B are both sialoglycoproteins. The sialic residues are the primary determinant of the net negative charge of the RBC membrane. Glycophorin A associates with band 3 in the RBC membrane. Glycophorin A has a sialic acid-dependent site for <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> invasion and a receptor for certain viruses and <em>E. coli</em> species. Glycophorin A also can act as a complement receptor.

It occurs in &lt;1 percent of most populations, including Caucasians. However, the prevalence is 6, 7, and 9 percent in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Thai populations, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">MNS antibodies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-M</strong> &ndash; Anti-M can be naturally occurring. It is usually an IgM or cold reactive IgG antibody and will sometimes react better if the patient's serum is acidified. The antibody rarely causes a transfusion reaction, unless it is reactive at body temperature. HDFN due to anti-M has only rarely been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-N</strong> &ndash; Anti-N is generally considered to have little if any clinical significance.

The antibody is almost always IgM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-En(a)</strong> &ndash; Anti-En<sup>a</sup> can occur in the extremely rare case of the En(a-) phenotype (complete absence of glycophorin A). Anti-En<sup>a</sup> can cause severe HTRs and HDFN. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-Mur</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> Anti-Mur is an antibody directed against the low frequency antigen MUR; it has been reported to cause mild and severe HDFN. The gene encoding MUR antigen is more common in Asian populations; thus, cases of otherwise unexplained HDFN in an Asian newborn should be examined for evidence of MUR incompatibility between the mother and father of the newborn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-S and anti-s</strong> &ndash; Anti-S will frequently be found as an underlying alloantibody in patients with warm autoantibodies. Both anti-S and anti-s can cause HTR, although the majority are mild to moderate in severity. Anti-S and anti-s are mainly IgG, and thus can cross the placenta and cause HDFN, although severe cases are rare. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-U</strong> &ndash; Anti-U can present as a relatively common serologic problem, especially in Blacks, who have a higher incidence of the U-negative phenotype (absence of glycophorin B). Anti-U can cause both severe HTRs and severe HDFN. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If no anti-U is available to screen for compatible RBC units for a patient with anti-U and a relatively large Black donor population exists, soybean lectin may be used for screening. Soybean lectin will react with U-negative RBCs, which contain reduced amounts of sialic acid.

This protein is a metalloendopeptidase that may have a role in activating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inactivating bioactive peptides. The most readily recognized antigens in this system are K (also called KEL1) and its alternate allele k (also called Cellano or KEL2); Kp<sup>a</sup> (KEL3) and Kp<sup>b</sup> (KEL4); and Js<sup>a</sup> (KEL6) and Js<sup>b</sup> (KEL7). Microbial infection will sometimes cause transient depression of Kell system antigens (particularly Kp<sup>b</sup>). The Kell proteins require intact disulfide bonds to maintain antigenic integrity.</p><p>Expression of the Kell antigens also requires the XK protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106903\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106903 \">figure 1</a>), encoded by a separate <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/314850&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWFLrNbZYmVQB0Ej+kafKm7tINLjmISMrThq5BUi1O+lq&amp;TOPIC_ID=7924\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">XK</a> gene. The XK gene appears to be closely linked with the locus for X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in males; however, there is no evidence to suggest a pathophysiologic role. XK is a transmembrane transporter that is linked to Kell by a disulfide bond. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>McLeod</strong> &ndash; The McLeod phenotype is associated with uniformly weak K system antigens due to mutations in <em>XK, </em>the gene product of which is required for appropriate membrane anchoring of the glycoprotein carrying the Kell antigens as noted above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106903\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106903 \">figure 1</a>).

Mutations in the <em>XK</em> gene, can be associated with the McLeod syndrome, a rare X-linked syndrome characterized by chorea, other neurologic deficits, and myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

It is important to note that this enzyme treatment can destroy Kell system antigens, and care must be taken to select K1-negative units for transfusion in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion#H1493568680\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;, section on 'Daratumumab'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h3\">Kell antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-K is capable of causing severe HTR and HDFN. Bacteria can elicit production of anti-K, probably due to cross-reactive antigens. Anti-k is one of the most common antibodies directed against high frequency antigens (the population frequency of k-negative individuals is approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">1/500)</span>. Anti-Js<sup>b</sup> is seen primarily in African Americans. Anti-Js<sup>a</sup> and anti-Kp<sup>a</sup> are directed against low frequency antigens in the random donor population. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HTR</strong> &ndash; Antibodies to Kell antigens can cause HTR. In individuals who have CGD and the McLeod phenotype, transfusion can induce the production of an anti-Km alloantibody. These individuals can receive McLeod or K<sub>0</sub> blood. Patients who have the CGD and McLeod phenotype can also form an alloantibody called anti-KL, which consists of anti-Km and anti-Kx (Kx is an antigen on the XK protein). These individuals can only be transfused with blood from ABO compatible donors who also have the McLeod phenotype. Individuals who are K-null or Kmod can also produce an antibody called anti-Ku. These individuals must receive only K<sub>0</sub> blood, which is exceedingly rare and can only be procured through donor centers connected with rare donor registries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anti-k, anti-Js<sup>b</sup>, anti-Js<sup>a</sup>, anti-Kp<sup>a</sup>, and anti-Kp<sup>b</sup> can cause mild to moderate HTR as well. Formation of anti-Js<sup>a</sup> in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) who are receiving blood primarily from Black donors may reduce the available donor pool by approximately 30 percent (the frequency of the Js<sup>a</sup> antigen in Blacks). Because of the scarcity of reagent grade anti-Js<sup>a</sup>, the patient's serum may need to be used for finding Js<sup>a</sup>-negative donor units, providing the antibody is reactive stronger than 1+ in the antiglobulin phase of testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HDFN</strong> &ndash; Anti-K is capable of causing severe HDFN and is responsible for a relatively large portion of clinically significant non-Rh HDFN. The K antigen is produced early in fetal development and is expressed on bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells; thus, antibodies to K can cause suppression of normal erythropoiesis in addition to hemolysis of mature RBCs. This bone marrow suppression is thought to account for the severity of anemia in Kell-associated HDFN. Anti-k, anti-Js<sup>b</sup>, anti-Js<sup>a</sup>, anti-Kp<sup>a</sup>, and anti-Kp<sup>b</sup> can cause mild to moderate HDFN (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy#H1594361\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of non-Rhesus (D) red blood cell alloantibodies during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Kell'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn#H1826932948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal diagnosis and management of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn&quot;, section on 'Postnatal management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>AIHA</strong> &ndash; Approximately 1 in 250 patients with warm-reacting AIHA will have autoantibody directed against Kell blood group system antigens. Sometimes patients with AIHA who express the Kp<sup>b</sup> antigen can have transient depression of antigen expression (eg, due to concurrent infection), making an autoantibody to Kp<sup>b</sup> &quot;appear&quot; to be an alloantibody. This can create a dilemma as to whether the patient should receive Kp(b-) blood. Radiochromium red cell survival studies may be useful in determining the antibody's clinical significance at a particular point in time.

DARC is encoded by the <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/613665&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWIPiOZ6p4E8krGjpdjgHd7XGLtgmGDcu737KLEPyTfly&amp;TOPIC_ID=7924\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ACKR1</a> gene. Individuals may express any combination of Fy<sup>a</sup> and Fy<sup>b</sup>; those that are Fy(a-b-) are also referred to as being homozygous for the Fy allele. This allele results from a polymorphism in the <em>ACKR1 </em>promotor that disrupts transcription factor binding and blocks expression in erythroid cells.</p><p>DARC is a multi-pass membrane glycoprotein that acts as a chemokine receptor for certain pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, RANTES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Duffy antigens are also used by malaria parasites (<em>Plasmodium vivax</em> and <em>P. knowlesi</em>) to enter the RBC. As a result, approximately 70 percent of West African Blacks are Fy(a-b-), which is protective against invasion of these malaria species. The merozoites can attach to Fy(a-b-) RBCs, but cannot enter the cell and eventually detach, leaving the RBC markedly deformed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
