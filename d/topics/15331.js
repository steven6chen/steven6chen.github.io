The material is either spat out or re-swallowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rumination syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed as gastroesophageal reflux disease or vomiting, resulting in a delay in diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This topic will review the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and management of rumination syndrome. An approach to patients with nausea and vomiting and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease are discussed in detail separately.

In a study that surveyed 2163 children and adolescents, 110 (5 percent) fulfilled clinical criteria for rumination syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are limited data on the prevalence of rumination syndrome in adults. In two population-based studies, rumination syndrome had a prevalence of 0.8 to 0.9 percent of adults in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In patients with fibromyalgia or eating disorders, the prevalence of rumination syndrome may be as high as 7 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3325916428\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rumination syndrome has been associated with anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and constipation from a rectal evacuation disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>]. While some studies have suggested that rumination syndrome occurs predominantly among children and adults with development delay, this has not been substantiated by other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2634050783\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of rumination syndrome is unclear, but unperceived abdominal wall activation in the postprandial period appears to be a key pathogenetic feature. The retrograde flow of ingested gastric content into the mouth in patients with rumination syndrome occurs due to a combination of raised intra-abdominal pressure coupled with negative intrathoracic pressure, resulting in a permissive esophagogastric gradient. On postprandial esophageal high resolution impedance manometry, rumination follows gastric pressurizations exceeding 30 mmHg, which is associated with lower and upper esophageal relaxation at the time of gastric pressurization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113600 \">figure 1</a>). This indicates that raised intra-abdominal pressure alone cannot explain rumination and that upper and lower esophageal sphincter function also likely play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esophageal-multichannel-intraluminal-impedance-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-manometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution manometry&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Typical findings during a gastroduodenal manometry include a characteristic spike pattern recorded simultaneously across all sensors termed the &quot;R&quot; wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113600 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This spike in intraluminal pressure is thought to occur due to activation of abdominal wall musculature. Postprandial activation of the abdominal wall has also been observed during electromyography recordings and correlate with regurgitation episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113600 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. One study suggested that the reflux of gastric content into the esophagus in rumination is preceded by an elevation of the gastroesophageal junction into the thorax creating a false hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, the significance of this observation remains unknown, particularly as it has also been described in healthy people during physical activity. The majority of patients with rumination syndrome appear to have normal gastric accommodation and emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471178872\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rumination syndrome is characterized by rapid onset of regurgitation, usually within 10 minutes of finishing a meal. Episodes often persist for one to two hours after the meal, and the regurgitant consists of partially digested food that is recognizable in its taste to ingested food. Regurgitation is effortless and is often triggered by a sensation of discomfort (pressure, pain, burning) in the abdomen that is relieved by regurgitation.</p><p>Episodes are usually not preceded by retching. The material is consciously spat out or re-swallowed. Regurgitation occurs after most, if not all, meals. Patients often adapt their eating behaviors to compensate for this, and may avoid eating in social situations. </p><p>Patients frequently report associated dyspeptic symptoms including epigastric fullness or burning, and nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. Overt pain is rarely a feature. Weight loss has been observed in approximately 20 to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>]. Significant weight loss, electrolyte abnormalities, dental erosions, and malnutrition are rare in the absence of a co-existing eating disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3126485271\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67691851\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rumination syndrome should be suspected in patients with effortless postprandial regurgitation without retching. A clinical diagnosis of rumination syndrome requires the fulfillment of symptom-based diagnostic criteria and a limited evaluation to exclude a mechanical obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113604 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113602 \">table 2</a>). We perform high resolution impedance pH manometry to confirm the diagnosis of rumination syndrome.

Regurgitation, unlike vomiting, is effortless, may not be associated with nausea, and is not preceded by retching or heaving. Vomitus, unlike regurgitate, in patients with rumination syndrome, cannot voluntarily be kept in the mouth or re-swallowed. Patients with rumination syndrome often report a triggering event before the onset of the symptoms of rumination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In children and adolescents with symptoms suggestive of rumination syndrome, an eating disorder should be excluded based on the history.

Upper endoscopy is usually normal in patients with rumination syndrome. In rare cases, patients may have evidence of esophagitis. We perform biopsies to exclude other disorders (eg, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, celiac disease, and <em>H. pylori</em> infection). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3916491171\"><span class=\"h3\">High resolution impedance pH manometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic findings of rumination syndrome on postprandial high resolution impedance manometry are reflux events extending to the proximal esophagus that are closely associated with an increase in gastric pressure to &gt;30 mm Hg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113600 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

A diagnostic cutoff for gastric pressure increase &gt;25&nbsp;mmHg, associated with retrograde bolus flow into the proximal esophagus, has been proposed as diagnostic cut off for rumination syndrome in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3178754461\"><span class=\"h3\">Other tests</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastroduodenal manometry</strong> &ndash; Gastroduodenal manometry was historically used to diagnose rumination syndrome, but is cumbersome, invasive, and is not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>]. The hallmark of rumination on gastroduodenal manometry is a postprandial &quot;R-wave&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113600 \">figure 1</a>). This spike in intraluminal pressure is thought to occur due to activation of abdominal wall musculature.

The majority of patients with rumination syndrome have normal gastric accommodation and emptying. In the author&rsquo;s clinical experience, the test often fails because the patient regurgitates the meal during the study period. (See <a href=\"#H2634050783\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2396390419\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few other gastrointestinal disorders which present with frequent, effortless postprandial regurgitation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Achalasia</strong> &ndash; Some patients with achalasia and poor gastric accommodation have post-prandial regurgitation. However, the predominant symptom in patients with achalasia is dysphagia which is not a feature of rumination syndrome. Achalasia can be distinguished from rumination syndrome by esophageal manometry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H386844726\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Esophageal manometry'</a> and <a href=\"#H3916491171\" class=\"local\">'High resolution impedance pH manometry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</strong> &ndash; Regurgitate in rumination syndrome lacks a sour, bitter, or acid taste reported in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Unlike GERD, rumination syndrome episodes are not nocturnal. Medications that suppress gastric acid production, such as proton pump inhibitors, typically do not improve symptoms in patients with rumination syndrome. GERD can be distinguished from rumination syndrome by impedance pH manometry by detecting gastric straining preceding or during reflux events that extend to the proximal esophagus.

These include education, treatment of underlying mood disorder, and behavior modification with diaphragmatic breathing.

The aim of education is to enhance the patient's understanding of their disease and to encourage patients to take an active role in the management of their condition. A multidisciplinary approach, involving gastroenterologists and psychologists, is necessary, especially in patients with underlying depression, anxiety disorder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> refractory symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-treating-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to treating generalized anxiety disorder in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3420809286\"><span class=\"h3\">Diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of therapy for rumination syndrome is diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113705\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113705 \">figure 2</a>). Diaphragmatic breathing reduces postprandial intragastric pressure and increases esophagogastric junction zone pressure, restoring the gastroesophageal pressure gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Using this technique, patients inhale by contracting the diaphragm and expanding the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> &ndash; Patients are instructed to place one hand on the abdomen and one on the chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113705\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113705 \">figure 2</a>). We then instruct patients to slowly inhale through the nose, and during inhalation only the hand on the abdomen should rise, and the hand on the chest should move minimally. Patients then slowly exhale via the mouth. Each inhalation or exhalation should be slow and complete with a goal of six to eight respirations per minute. Patients are initially taught in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Once they gain practice, the technique is re-enforced in semisupine or sitting position. Some patients require several sessions to learn the technique. We typically instruct patients to perform diaphragmatic breathing exercises immediately after a meal and continue for 10 to 15 minutes or longer until the sensation of regurgitation resolves. Diaphragmatic breathing can be combined with an electromyography or high resolution impedance manometry to provide visually guided biofeedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. However, it is unclear if biofeedback improves effectiveness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effectiveness</strong> &ndash; Diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing may be effective in the treatment of rumination syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/2,10,14,15,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,14,15,28</a>]. A randomized trial that included 24 patients with rumination syndrome confirmed by gastroduodenal manometry were assigned to either diaphragmatic breathing with biofeedback or premeal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simethicone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simethicone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients in the diaphragmatic breathing group were trained to modulate abdominothoracic muscle activity using electromyographic guided biofeedback in three sessions over 10 days. Patients were instructed to perform diaphragmatic breathing exercises for five minutes before and after each meal. At 10 days, diaphragmatic breathing with biofeedback, but not placebo, resulted in a significant reduction in rumination episodes as compared with baseline (74 versus 1 percent). Postprandial abdominal symptoms decreased as compared with baseline, but there was no difference between groups. Patients in the placebo group who failed to improve during the 10 day period subsequently received diaphragmatic breathing training with biofeedback and were advised to continue exercises over time. Among 21 total patients who were trained in diaphragmatic breathing with biofeedback, there was a significant and progressive reduction in the number of daily rumination episodes over six months. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555594285\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory symptoms</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2219850501\"><span class=\"h3\">Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We reserve the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> for patients with symptoms refractory to initial management. Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist that raises lower esophageal sphincter tone and suppresses transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations. In an open label trial, 16 adult patients with clinically suspected rumination syndrome were treated with baclofen (10 mg three times daily) for one week. In 12 patients who completed the study, treatment with baclofen was associated with a significant reduction in the number of postprandial flow events and symptoms as compared with baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, long-term data on efficacy and tolerability are lacking. Baclofen crosses the blood-brain barrier and causes a variety of central nervous system-related side effects. Side-effects primarily include somnolence, confusion, dizziness, lightheadedness, drowsiness, weakness, and trembling. We usually begin by giving 10 mg at bedtime, which can be increased slowly to 20 mg three times daily while carefully monitoring for side effects. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3941922920\"><span class=\"h3\">Therapies of uncertain benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several approaches that have been used to treat patients with rumination syndrome that we do not recommend, due to lack of data demonstrating efficacy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prokinetics</strong> &ndash; In one study in which 21 adults with rumination syndrome were treated with levosulpiride, a selective dopamine D2-receptor antagonist with prokinetic activity, in combination with supportive psychotherapy, over an eight-month period; 38 percent reported an improvement in symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rumination-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1273210076\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of rumination syndrome is unclear, but unperceived abdominal wall activation in the postprandial period appears to be a key pathogenetic feature. The retrograde flow of ingested gastric content into the mouth in patients with rumination syndrome occurs due to a combination of raised intra-abdominal pressure coupled with negative intrathoracic pressure, resulting in a permissive esophagogastric gradient. (See <a href=\"#H2634050783\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rumination syndrome can affect both children and adults. It has been associated with anxiety, depression, and constipation secondary to a rectal evacuation disorder. The estimated prevalence of rumination syndrome is 0.8 to 0.9 percent in adults in the general population. In patients with fibromyalgia or eating disorders, the prevalence of rumination syndrome may be as high as 7 to 8 percent. (See <a href=\"#H799267114\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features of rumination syndrome include rapid onset of regurgitation usually within 10 minutes of finishing a meal. The regurgitated material is similar to ingested food. Regurgitation is effortless and is not preceded by retching. The material is either spat out or re-swallowed. Regurgitation occurs after most, if not all, meals. Patients frequently report associated dyspeptic symptoms including epigastric fullness or burning, and nausea. (See <a href=\"#H471178872\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rumination syndrome should be suspected in patients with effortless postprandial regurgitation without retching. A clinical diagnosis of rumination syndrome requires the fulfillment of symptom-based diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113604 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113602 \">table 2</a>). High resolution impedance manometry testing is an important adjunct for the clinical diagnosis. It serves to rule out achalasia, and postprandial evaluation can be used to objectively confirm rumination syndrome. In addition, we also perform an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with suspected rumination syndrome to rule out a structural esophagogastric disorder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diagnostic findings of rumination syndrome on postprandial high resolution impedance manometry are reflux events extending to the proximal esophagus that are closely associated with an increase in gastric pressure to &gt;30 mm Hg. (See <a href=\"#H67691851\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3916491171\" class=\"local\">'High resolution impedance pH manometry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management of rumination syndrome consists of education, treatment of underlying mood disorder, and behavior modification with diaphragmatic breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing reduces postprandial intragastric pressure and increases esophagogastric junction pressure, restoring the gastroesophageal pressure gradient. We reserve the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> for patients with symptoms refractory to initial treatment.
