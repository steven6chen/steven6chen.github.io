Long-term use of MHT for prevention of disease is not currently recommended.</p><p>One of the greatest concerns of women who are considering MHT is the relationship between hormone use and breast cancer. Data from the WHI suggest a small increase in risk with combined estrogen-progestin therapy, but a reduction in risk with short-term unopposed estrogen therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Women's Health Initiative'</a> below.)</p><p>The impact of exogenous estrogen, alone or combined with a progestin, on breast cancer risk will be reviewed here. The relationship between endogenous hormones and breast cancer, a general discussion of the risks and benefits of MHT, and an overview of menopausal symptom management are discussed separately.

The increase in risk was first seen in year 3 in women who had previously used menopausal hormones, but not until year 4 in women with no previous use.</p><p>From an individual perspective, a critical issue is the <strong>absolute risk</strong> of developing breast cancer. In the combined estrogen-progestin WHI trial, there were eight excess cases per 10,000 person-years at an average of 5.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>After the active intervention arms were stopped in the WHI, several updates with longer follow-up have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. During the intervention phase, there were 206 and 155 cases of invasive breast cancer in the combined hormone therapy and placebo groups, respectively (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

As noted above, the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, using WHI data, estimated the excess risk of breast cancer related to hormone use. For unopposed conjugated estrogen, they estimated there would be 2.5 fewer cases of breast cancer per 1000 women (in their 50s) taking hormones for five years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87938 \">figure 2</a>).

By the end of the follow-up period, combined therapy, when compared with placebo, significantly increased both the cumulative frequency of abnormal mammograms (35 versus 23 percent, respectively) and the need for breast biopsies (10 versus 6.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In contrast, the use of unopposed estrogen increased the rate of mammograms requiring short-interval follow-up (cumulative rate by the end of the trial 39.2 versus 29.6 percent for unopposed estrogen therapy versus placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but not abnormal mammograms.</p><p>Stopping MHT (either combined therapy or unopposed estrogen) short term does <strong>not</strong> reduce the rate of abnormal mammograms. In a separate, randomized trial of 1704 postmenopausal women taking MHT who were due for an annual mammogram, suspending MHT for one to two months reduced breast density slightly, but it did not significantly reduce mammography recall rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most studies, the risk of breast cancer does not appear to be increased in women who take combined estrogen-progestin therapy for less than four or five years, but then increases with longer duration of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. The analysis of epidemiologic studies cited above found that the relative risk (RR) of developing cancer was 1.35 for women who were current hormone users and had taken hormones for five years or longer compared with never users (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63013\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63013 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A similar timeframe was noted in the WHI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69819\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69819 \">figure 1</a>), although the increase in risk was seen after only three years in women who had previously used menopausal hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Of note, most available data, including the WHI, are based upon oral conjugated estrogens. It is not known if different types of estrogens or different routes of estrogen administration would be associated with different risk profiles.</p><p>For unopposed estrogen, there did not appear to be increased risk of breast cancer in the WHI. However, in an updated report from the Nurses' Health Study of 28,835 women who had undergone hysterectomy, long-term, but not shorter-term, use of unopposed estrogen was associated with a statistically significant increase in breast cancer risk (RR for current use &gt;20 years = 1.42, 95% CI 1.13-1.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The risk of estrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">receptor-positive/progesterone</span> receptor-positive <span class=\"nowrap\">(ER+/PR+)</span> cancers became statistically significant after 15 years of unopposed use (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.07). Similar results were noted in another prospective cohort study, the Million Women Study (MWS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the MWS also observed an increased risk of breast cancer with less than five years of use, which is in contrast to the WHI and many other studies.</p><p>For past users, duration of use does not appear to be strongly related to breast cancer risk. In the combined analysis of epidemiologic studies, women who had stopped MHT more than five years previously were not at increased risk compared with never users, regardless of the duration of previous use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there have not been enough data on long-term past users; there may still be a risk associated with past use if the duration was long enough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150020558\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of progestins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The randomized WHI study showed that conjugated estrogen plus MPA modestly increased breast cancer risk, compared with estrogen alone. Many of the earlier epidemiologic studies have grouped together unopposed estrogen and combined estrogen-progestin users. The majority of studies that have distinguished between these groups have reported a greater risk of breast cancer in those receiving combined therapy compared with unopposed estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/1,2,13,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,13,16-20</a>].</p><p>There has also been a suggestion that progestin given continuously with estrogen may be associated with higher risk than regimens in which the progestin is given in a cyclic fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], but this has not been reported in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>].

Support for this hypothesis is derived from the observation that the proliferative activity of the breast in premenopausal women is highest during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, a time of increasing progesterone secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72415 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, women treated with combined estrogen-progestin therapy have greater increases in mammographic density and more cell proliferation in benign breast biopsies than those taking unopposed estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and in vitro studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] have found differing effects of progesterone on breast cell proliferation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150020565\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of progestin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of progestin may also affect breast cancer risk. A synthetic progestin, MPA, was used in the WHI trial and was associated with excess breast cancer risk. Limited observational data suggest that natural micronized progesterone may not be associated with additional risk. In a prospective cohort study of approximately 80,000 women, menopausal hormone regimens containing estrogen plus a synthetic progestin were associated with an excess breast cancer risk, while regimens containing estrogen plus natural progesterone were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

As an example, in the prospective Nurses' Health Study, the risk of breast cancer was significantly increased in women who took MHT for more than five years but did not consume alcohol (relative risk [RR] 1.32) and for those who drank at least 1.5 to 2 drinks per day but did not take MHT (RR 1.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. For women who used MHT for more than five years <strong>and</strong> drank at least 1.5 to 2 drinks daily, the RR was even higher at 1.99.

It is likely that these observational studies did not account completely for residual confounding, with hormone users being overall healthier and at lower risk of recurrence than nonusers.</p><p>Two randomized, clinical trials have been conducted among breast cancer survivors, and the results are conflicting. The larger study was the Hormonal Replacement Therapy After Breast Cancer - Is It<strong> </strong>Safe? (HABITS) trial with follow-up data on 442 women randomized to either MHT (the majority used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> with or without norethisterone acetate depending upon the presence of a uterus) versus nonhormonal symptom management. The HABITS trial was stopped early due to an increase in breast cancer events in the MHT arm.</p><p>With median follow-up of four years, new breast cancer events occurred almost twice as often in the hormone group compared with the nonhormone group (39 of 221 versus 17 of 221, hazard ratio [HR] 2.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The cumulative incidence of a breast cancer event in the hormone and nonhormone groups at five years was estimated at 22 and 8 percent, respectively.</p><p>A similar trial in Stockholm was started at the same time as HABITS and also terminated early based upon the results of the HABITS trial and difficulties in recruitment. Unlike the HABITS trial, after 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in new breast cancer events overall, with 60 in the MHT group and 48 in the controls (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.9), but there <strong>was </strong>an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer with MHT (RR 3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Possible explanations include the use of different progestins (norethisterone acetate in HABITS, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [MPA] in Stockholm study), the small number of events in both trials, and a lower-risk patient population with greater use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> in the Stockholm trial compared with HABITS. Although the data are not entirely consistent, the increase in risk observed in the HABITS trial is of great concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Thus, we agree with expert guidelines that recommend the use of nonestrogen therapies for controlling symptoms before considering MHT in these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
