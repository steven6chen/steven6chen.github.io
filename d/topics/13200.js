PCSK9 binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) on the surface of hepatocytes, leading to the degradation of the LDL-R and higher plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Antibodies to PCSK9 interfere with its binding of the LDL-R leading to higher hepatic LDL-R expression and lower plasma LDL-C levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109034 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>There are several strategies to lower free plasma PCSK9, including antisense, silencing ribonucleic acid (RNA), and monoclonal antibody strategies. PCSK9-antibodies are the first of these therapies approved for clinical use. These antibodies are specific for PCSK9 and do not bind to other members of the PCSK enzyme family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alirocumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alirocumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evolocumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">evolocumab</a> are fully humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind free plasma PCSK9, promoting degradation of this enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. As a result, less free PCSK9 is available in plasma to bind to LDL-R. This results in a higher fraction of LDL-R recycling towards the hepatocyte surface. As a direct consequence, the liver has the capacity to remove more LDL-C from the circulation, resulting in lower LDL-C plasma levels. </p><p>Another potential method of interfering with PCSK9 is to block its synthesis, which is dependent on messenger RNA. A study of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule, which can direct sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA for PCSK9, is ongoing. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study of healthy adult volunteers with serum LDL-C levels of &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (116 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> who received a single dose of one such siRNA (ALN-PCS), treatment with the highest dose lead to a 70 percent mean reduction in circulating PCSK9 and a mean 40 percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline relative to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3737725125\" class=\"local\">'Ongoing investigation'</a> below.)</p><p>Other mechanisms, besides LDL-C lowering, by which PCSK9 antibodies might improve cardiovascular outcomes have been postulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These include a reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress within atherosclerotic plaques and inhibition of prothrombotic pathways. For patients with an acute coronary syndrome, these effects might be of particular value.</p><p>Circulating levels of PCSK9 are upregulated in the presence of statins, suggesting that inhibiting the PCSK9 pathway may complement the LDL-C lowering effect of statins (see <a href=\"#H1605226578\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063920136\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EFFECT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While post-hoc analyses of early randomized trials suggested a mortality benefit to these agents, the longest term (2.2 years) study (FOURIER) found no mortality benefit.

Despite the lack of a mortality benefit in FOURIER, the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke was significantly lowered.</p><p>Clinical relevance of the inhibition of proprotein convertase <span class=\"nowrap\">subtilisin/kexin</span> type 9 (PCSK9) has been substantiated by Mendelian randomization studies, in which PCSK9<em> </em>loss-of-function mutations were associated with both reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, as well as a significantly lower cardiovascular event risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].
