(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Myocardial ischemia and infarction'</a>.)</p><p>Coronary artery thrombosis is the final pathogenic mechanism of most cases with ACS, as documented by angiographic and pathologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. For example, coronary artery thrombi are found in 50 to 75 percent of cases of sudden cardiac death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of platelets in coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The formation of an intraluminal clot is thought to result from the loss of integrity of a protective covering over an atherosclerotic plaque. In healthy arteries, a single layer of endothelial cells separates the blood from potentially thrombogenic components of the arterial medial layer. With atherogenic plaque in the underlying intima, there is loss of integrity of the protective covering, referred to as plaque rupture or erosion. This disruption allows blood to come in contact with the highly thrombogenic contents of the necrotic core of the plaque and luminal thrombosis to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Intraluminal thrombosis after exposure of blood to calcified nodules has also been observed. Other mechanisms of ACS, such as a supply-demand mismatch, have been postulated.</p><p>Plaque rupture or erosion often occurs at sites where luminal stenosis is angiographically modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Autopsy studies of sudden coronary death victims have shown that approximately 40 percent of plaque ruptures occur at lesion sites with less than 50 percent diameter stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In instances when rupture or erosion does not lead to thrombotic occlusion of the vessel, such an event may not necessarily cause symptoms and plaque healing results in plaque progression and greater luminal narrowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>This topic focuses on the contribution of plaque rupture to the development of ACS as well as potential strategies to detect and treat vulnerable plaques. The underlying pathology and pathogenesis of coronary plaque progression, including rupture, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of the vulnerable plaque&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452783\"><span class=\"h1\">PLAQUE FEATURES RESPONSIBLE FOR ACUTE THROMBOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute intraluminal thrombosis is characterized by layered platelet aggregates with variable amounts of fibrin, red blood cells, and acute inflammatory cells. Insights into the mechanisms of coronary thrombosis have come from detailed analyses of plaque morphologies in cases of sudden death and acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3,10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-15</a>]. Pathogenic mechanisms responsible for acute coronary thrombosis are plaque rupture, plaque erosion, and calcified nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72618\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72618 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452790\"><span class=\"h2\">Plaque rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plaque rupture is the most common morphology associated with acute coronary thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72618\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72618 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71847 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80581\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80581 \">figure 3</a>). The morphology of plaque rupture shows an intraluminal thrombus overlying a thin disrupted fibrous cap covering an atherosclerotic plaque. The cap is infiltrated by macrophages and T-lymphocytes on an advanced lesion with a relatively large necrotic core (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61067\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61067 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The fibrous cap consists mainly of type I collagen with varying degrees of macrophages and lymphocytes, whereas the smooth muscle cells component within the cap is absent or sparse. Although it is widely accepted that fibrous cap rupture occurs at its weakest point often near shoulder regions, autopsy studies using serially cut sections demonstrate an equal number of ruptures occurring at the mid-portion of the fibrous cap. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque#H13450322\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of the vulnerable plaque&quot;, section on 'Thin-cap fibroatheroma (vulnerable plaque)'</a>.) </p><p>A breach in the fibrous cap allows circulating cellular and noncellular elements of blood to come in direct contact with the highly thrombogenic components of the necrotic core and is thought to be directly responsible for the actual development of the thrombus. Historically, the necrotic core was thought to be the main source of the tissue factor; however, it is now believed that circulating monocytes, instead of macrophages alone, supply tissue factor that trigger and propagate acute thrombi overlying unstable coronary atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At the rupture site, the luminal thrombus often is platelet-rich thereby giving rise to a grossly white appearance (white thrombus), while at the proximal and distal ends near the sites of propagation it appears red (red thrombus) as it is composed of layers of fibrin and red blood cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of platelets in coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Platelet adhesion and aggregation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76054075\"><span class=\"h2\">Plaque erosion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plaque erosion represents the second most prevalent underlying morphology of acute coronary thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque#H13450341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of the vulnerable plaque&quot;, section on 'Plaque erosion'</a>.)</p><p>The characteristics of the overlying thrombus differ significantly from those seen with in patients with plaque rupture. Autopsy studies of sudden death victims have shown that greater than 85 percent of thrombi in erosions exhibited late stages of healing characterized by inflammatory cell lysis, invasion by smooth muscle cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endothelial cells, or organized layers of smooth muscle cells and proteoglycans with varying degrees of <span class=\"nowrap\">platelet/fibrin</span> layering, whereas in ruptures only one-half of thrombi show healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Postmortem studies have shown that coronary thrombi superimposed on eroded plaques contain a higher density of myeloperoxidase-positive cells than thrombi superimposed on ruptured plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Systemic myeloperoxidase levels are also elevated in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) presenting with eroded plaque as compared to those presenting with rupture, suggesting that elevations in selective inflammatory biomarkers may reflect specific acute coronary events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>An intense accumulation of extracellular matrix molecules such as hyaluronan and versican (proteoglycan) are observed at the sites of plaque erosion whereas there is relatively little accumulation of proteoglycans and hyaluronan at plaque rupture sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is hypothesized that a selective accumulation of hyaluronan in eroded plaques may promote the de-endothelialization and platelet aggregation. Hyaluronan can directly promote the polymerization of fibrin, which may facilitate smooth muscle cell migration and plaque progression. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452804\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcified nodule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The calcified nodule represents the least frequent underlying pathology of luminal thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This term is reserved for fibrocalcific plaques with little or no underlying necrotic core with disruption of the luminal surface and thrombosis attributed to eruptive dense calcified nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72618\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72618 \">figure 1</a>). These occur in heavily calcified arteries and often show large plates of calcified matrix with surrounding areas of fibrosis, inflammation, and neovascularization. Although the precise nature of this lesion remains incompletely understood, fragmentation of the calcified plates can contribute to the nodular calcification where even sometimes bone formation can be observed with interspersed fibrin. These lesions are generally more prevalent in older males with tortuous coronary arteries, and chronic renal failure. The calcified nodule erodes into the lumen and the overlying collagen is thinned along with endothelial loss allowing the bare calcium to be in contact with the flowing blood and thrombus formation to occur.</p><p>Additional information about the prevalence, distribution, and outcomes of patients with calcified nodules comes from PROSPECT study (see <a href=\"#H13452912\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Three-vessel gray-scale and virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed in the proximal-mid segments of all three coronary arteries in 697 patients with ACS who underwent stenting. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, 314 nodules were found in 250 of 1573 analyzable arteries, with a prevalence of 17 percent per artery and 30 percent per patient. Two or more nodules were found in 3 percent of arteries and 12 percent of patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The calcified nodules were located &lt;40 mm from the ostium of the coronary artery in about 85 percent of the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries; they were more evenly distributed along the length of the right coronary arteries. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with calcified nodules were significantly older and had more plaque volume and thick-cap atheroma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with calcified nodules had fewer cumulative major non-culprit adverse events during a median follow-up of three years (7 versus 14 percent).</p><p/><p>Caution must be exercised, however, when interpreting these results, as most of the IVUS-detected calcified nodules in this study do not have thrombus, whereas the previously reported calcified nodules in the pathologic studies require the presence of luminal thrombus. &ldquo;Non-thrombotic calcified nodules&rdquo; should have been discriminated from &ldquo;calcified nodules,&rdquo; and the non-thrombotic calcified nodules have been described as &ldquo;nodular calcification&rdquo; by our group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the PROSPECT study, patients with &ldquo;IVUS-detected nodular calcification&rdquo; had fewer cardiac events than those without, suggesting that these lesions are not high-risk plaques predictive of future events. However, prognostic significance of identifying &quot;calcified nodules&quot; and &quot;nodular calcification&quot; should be confirmed by future studies utilizing other imaging modalities that enable more accurate detection of thrombus and nodules of calcification. &#160; &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452847\"><span class=\"h1\">PLAQUE MORPHOLOGY IN ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452854\"><span class=\"h2\">Sudden cardiac death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In autopsy studies of patients with sudden cardiac death, thrombus has been reported in 50 to 75 percent of cases. The underlying pathologic lesions are plaque rupture (55 to 65 percent), erosion (30 to 40 percent for erosion), and calcified nodules (2 to 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452861\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute myocardial infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), an autopsy study has shown that approximately 75 percent of cases are due to plaque rupture, and remaining 25 percent are attributed to plaque erosion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This finding has been confirmed by clinical studies utilizing high-resolution (10 to 15 &mu;m) imaging modality optical coherence tomography (OCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes using OCT, plaque rupture was in 47 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Studies using intravascular ultrasound also report an incidence of plaque rupture more frequently in patients with STEMI than in those with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (46 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. One OCT study has reported that the incidence of plaque rupture in <span class=\"nowrap\">NSTEMI/unstable</span> angina is 47 percent, whereas in STEMI it is 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravascular-ultrasound-optical-coherence-tomography-and-angioscopy-of-coronary-circulation#H321552326\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and angioscopy of coronary circulation&quot;, section on 'Optical coherence tomography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452869\"><span class=\"h2\">Unstable angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of plaque rupture in unstable angina is lower than with sudden cardiac death or acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In a quantitative comparison of the amount of narrowing by atherosclerotic plaques in the major epicardial coronary arteries at autopsy in cases of sudden coronary death, acute MI, and unstable angina, each of the major epicardial coronary arteries was divided into 5 mm long segments and histologic sections were prepared for each of the 4016 segments from 80 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. The proportion of severe cross-sectional area narrowing (&gt;75 percent) was greatest in unstable angina (48 percent) as compared to sudden coronary death (36 percent) and acute MI (34 percent). These findings suggest that patients with fatal unstable angina have more extensive severe narrowing than those with sudden coronary death or acute MI. However, the fact that unstable angina patients had more severe stenoses does not necessarily mean that acute thrombosis was not the immediate cause of acute events including death. These studies date back to the time when saphenous vein graft was the main treatment for symptomatic coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, today most patients with angina do not die acutely from their disease. Many patients die of heart failure as a result of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Some, in whom angina has stabilized die of extracardiac causes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452876\"><span class=\"h2\">Age and sex differences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autopsy studies in both sudden coronary death and acute MI have revealed that plaque erosion is the primary lesion in patients under the age of 50 years and premenopausal women. In women older than 50 years, 80 percent of coronary thrombi occur from plaque rupture; when they occur in women younger than 50 years, there is a strong association with hyperlipidemia and smoking. </p><p>Although plaque ruptures occur in men of all ages, their relative incidence in sudden coronary death decreases with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174918233\"><span class=\"h2\">Other correlates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In deaths attributed to plaque rupture, approximately 70 percent of cases show the presence of thin-cap fibroatheromas remote from the actual rupture site. On the contrary, the incidence of thin-cap fibroatheromas is markedly less (30 percent) where deaths are associated with flow limiting stenosis or erosions.</p><p>The majority of thin-cap fibroatheromas occur predominantly in the proximal portion of the three major coronary arteries; the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery is the most frequent location (43 percent) followed by the proximal right coronary artery (20 percent) and left circumflex artery (18 percent) in acute coronary syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174918240\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeat plaque ruptures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plaque rupture with luminal thrombus may lead to ischemic symptoms. Total occlusion is often detected as ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram, while nonocclusive thrombosis may result in NSTEMI or unstable angina. While plaque rupture may lead to either death or MI, a single episode may occur without causing symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Plaque rupture with healing may be a repeated event at the same location. The lesion may exhibit multiple layers of necrotic cores separated by layers of collagen. These repeated thrombotic events contribute to gradual luminal narrowing and plaque progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This significant increase in plaque burden and luminal narrowing due to previous repeated thrombosis usually occurs in the absence of cardiac symptoms.

Autopsy data showed that 61 percent of hearts from sudden coronary death victims have healed plaque ruptures, where the incidence is around 80 percent in stable plaques with severe stenosis, and 75 percent in plaque rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The presence of angiographic complex lesions is associated with rapid progression of coronary stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. </p><p>A substantial proportion (40 percent) of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) have angiographic evidence of multiple complex lesions; this has been termed &ldquo;multiple plaque instability&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This situation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Angioscopic studies support this concept, by showing the presence of multiple yellow plaques, ie, vulnerable plaques, throughout the coronary-tree in patients with acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Furthermore, three-vessel intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging demonstrated that culprit plaque rupture, remote plaque rupture, and multiple plaque rupture were all more frequent in patients with acute MI as compared to those with stable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, in morphologic autopsy studies the incidence of multiple rupture sites in an individual is less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Other clinical studies utilizing IVUS have shown that the presence of plaque rupture in patients with acute MI is associated with increased C-reactive protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Moreover, in patients with first anterior acute ST elevation MI (STEMI), IVUS-identified plaque rupture was seen in 59 percent of cases while no such rupture was identified in the rest (41 percent). The vessel with rupture had larger size and had greater positive remodeling and led to larger infarct size and a higher incidence of no-reflow phenomenon following percutaneous coronary intervention as compared to those without rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This finding suggests that if plaque rupture is identified by IVUS it is more likely that the patients will have greater biomarker rise and a larger infarct and that the necrotic core is more likely to embolize because of greater vessel size and necrotic core that is responsible for the no-reflow phenomenon.</p><p>An optical coherence tomography (OCT) study in patients with acute coronary syndromes with plaque rupture has revealed that the site of plaque rupture at the shoulder region and was more frequently observed in patients with exertion-triggered symptom onset (93 percent) as compared to those with rest-onset (57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This study also showed that the median value of disrupted fibrous cap thickness was significantly greater in exertion-triggered plaque rupture (90 &micro;m) than rest-onset plaque rupture (50 &micro;m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, autopsy studies of sudden coronary death have shown that there were borderline difference in mean minimum thickness of fibrous cap between plaque ruptures associated with exertion (5.6 &micro;m) and those not related to exertion (9.9 &micro;m), while no difference was observed for mean maximal thickness of the fibrous cap (exertion; 27.9 versus rest; 30.8 &micro;m) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, the relationship between fibrous cap thickness and the mechanism of plaque rupture may be multifactorial and remains poorly understood. </p><p>Another study reported that <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT/optical</span> frequency domain imaging may potentially misdiagnose thin-cap fibroatheroma despite these imaging modalities having high resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The diagnostic accuracy of optical frequency domain imaging alone to identify thin-cap fibroatheroma (as defined pathologically) is limited (positive predictive value = 60.9 percent, k = 0.664; area under the curve = 0.88) mainly because of signal interference from macrophages. The addition of integrated backscatter intravascular ultrasound to optical frequency domain imaging improved the accuracy for thin-cap fibroatheroma detection. Therefore, it is important to consider the possibility of misdiagnosis in plaques thought to be thin-cap fibroatheroma by optical coherence tomography or optical frequency domain imaging.</p><p>OCT has also been used to study the relationship between plaque rupture and TIMI grade. In patients with STEMI who were treated with fibrinolysis, patients with impaired coronary flow (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow grade &le;2) had a higher incidence of plaque rupture as detected by optical coherence tomography than those with TIMI flow grade 3 (70 versus 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, mean minimal fibrous cap thickness was significantly less in patients with TIMI flow grade &le;2 as compared to those with TIMI flow grade 3 (48 versus 87 &micro;m), and minimal cap thickness was an independent determinant of TIMI flow grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This study suggests that the morphological characteristics of the culprit lesion in STEMI are associated with coronary flow after thrombolysis and may be related to the thrombus burden prior to fibrinolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452891\"><span class=\"h1\">VULNERABLE PLAQUES AND FUTURE RUPTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since plaque rupture accounts for approximately 55 to 75 percent of acute thrombi in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/3,15,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15,21,22</a>], early recognition of the thin-cap fibroatheroma might lead to early treatment of potentially fatal lesions.</p><p>Extensive efforts have been devoted to identify these rupture-prone &ldquo;vulnerable plaques.&rdquo; Advances in imaging technologies allow us to evaluate several morphologic features of coronary plaques in relation to the development of ACS in vivo, whereas the strategies to detect and treat vulnerable plaques for the prevention of plaque rupture need further refinements. </p><p>Retrospective studies have shown that most atherosclerotic plaques responsible for future acute coronary events have angiographically non-critical stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This phenomenon can be partly explained by positive arterial remodeling, which may represent one important feature for detecting lesion vulnerability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. The absence of severe narrowing in rupture-prone plaques, as well as the lack of ability to detect vulnerable morphologic features by means of angiography, has led to the use of various newer imaging modalities to identify vulnerable plaques. Several relevant studies from the perspective of preventing plaque rupture will be discussed here. </p><p>The conventional belief has been that plaque rupture of mild stenoses can lead to ACS and most ACS events are not related to plaque size and the degree of luminal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, it has been shown that rapid and sudden plaque progression can occur before ACS events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In one study, the average diameter stenosis that resulted in later ACS events was 36.5&plusmn;20.6 percent on angiography &gt;3 months before ACS events, whereas on angiography within next three months before the ACS event it was 59.1&plusmn;31.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Similarly, in another study, angiography performed within one week before myocardial infarction showed the mean diameter stenosis of 71&plusmn;12 percent, while in patients who received angiography 6 to 18 months before their event it was 30&plusmn;18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, a study using coronary angiography after successful fibrinolysis or thrombus aspiration in patients with ACS reported the average luminal stenosis was 61&plusmn;17 and 66&plusmn;12 percent, respectively, and a different postmortem study demonstrated &gt;70 percent of plaque ruptures involved &gt;75 percent cross-sectional area narrowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. Moreover, in a previous study a subset of individuals in whom serial coronary angiograms were performed at four-month intervals within one year showed rapid progression of plaque and &gt;70 percent of these patients developed ACS events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Collectively, these studies support the concept that rapid lesion progression may occur prior to some ACS events rather than their occurrence from plaques that have only minimal stenosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452905\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of vulnerable plaque by CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) angiography is emerging as a promising approach for the noninvasive assessment of coronary artery stenosis and plaque characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/56-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-60</a>].</p><p>One clinical study has reported a potential usefulness of CT angiography to identify vulnerable plaques that have not yet ruptured in patients who have not experienced an acute coronary event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Among a total of 1059 patients who underwent CT angiography, two important CT characteristics, positive remodeling, and low-attenuation plaque, were identified in 45 patients, and in another 27 patients only one feature was present. Of the 45 patients with these two characteristics, 10 (22.2 percent) developed ACS over a mean follow-up of 27 months, whereas one patient (3.7 percent) with a single feature developed ACS. In contrast, of the 820 patients who were negative for both features, only four (0.5 percent) developed ACS. This study suggests that coronary lesions showing both positive remodeling and low-attenuation plaques on CT angiography are at a higher risk of future acute coronary events. </p><p>Considering the radiation exposure, use of contrast media, and cost, CT angiography is not recommended for screening. However, recent advances in CT technology employing a larger number of slices, prospective electrocardiogram-gating scan, and dual-source CT may diminish limitations of this technology and facilitate its application for screening as well as risk assessment of ACS in the future. In addition, a study reported that significant stenoses (&gt;70 percent luminal stenosis) as well as positive remodeling and low attenuation plaque detected by CT were an independent predictors of future ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In the same study, serial CT angiography was performed in 449 patients and plaque progression was evaluated. Outcome of fatal and nonfatal ACS was recorded at 3.9 &plusmn; 2.4 years. In patients with serial CT angiography, plaque progression (PP) was also an independent predictor of ACS (with high-risk plaque [HRP], 27%; without HRP, 10%; compared with HRP <span class=\"nowrap\">[-]/PP[-],</span> 0.3%). Therefore, a combination of high-risk plaque (positive remodeling and low attenuation plaque), significant stenoses, and follow-up plaque progression are important CT characteristics for predicting future events. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452912\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the thin-cap fibroatheroma has been thought to be a precursor lesion of acute plaque rupture, prospective evaluation of the natural-history of thin-cap fibroatheromas has not been achieved.

These patients underwent three-vessel coronary angiography and gray-scale and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasonographic imaging after percutaneous coronary intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>The three-year cumulative rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (death from cardiac causes, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization due to unstable or progressive angina) was equally attributable to recurrence at the site of culprit lesions (13 percent) as well as to nonculprit lesions (12 percent). Multivariate analysis showed that a baseline plaque burden of 70 percent or greater, a minimal luminal area of 4.0 mm<sup>2</sup> or less, and the presence of thin-cap fibroatheroma as detected by radiofrequency intravascular ultrasonography were independent predictors of subsequent non-culprit-related major adverse cardiovascular events.</p><p>However, among 595 thin-cap fibroatheromas in non-culprit lesions at baseline, the major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in only 26 lesions at a median follow-up of 3.4 years (estimated Kaplan-Meier event rate, 4.9 percent). Even when all three predictors described above were present, the event rate increased to only 18.2 percent.</p><p>A serial virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) study (a proposed method for tissue characterization based on analysis of radiofrequency signals from the IVUS) has demonstrated that most thin-cap fibroatheromas as detected by VH-IVUS healed during 12-month follow-up, whereas new thin-cap fibroatheromas also developed overtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Given the dynamic nature of coronary atherosclerosis as shown by this serial VH-IVUS study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], it is possible that some thin-cap fibroatheromas at baseline in the PROSPECT study could have changed to thick-cap fibroatheromas during the follow-up period and conversely, some atherosclerotic lesions that were not detected as thin-cap fibroatheromas at baseline may have evolved overtime. Nevertheless, the results of the PROSPECT study suggest that the risk of plaque rupture in thin-cap fibroatheroma may not be high, and that refinements of strategies to detect and treat vulnerable plaques at higher risk for thrombotic complications are required.
