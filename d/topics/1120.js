The initial goal is to identify patients who have a serious or even life-threatening etiology for their symptoms and require urgent intervention. Additional issues in pregnant women include consideration of the impact of physiologic changes related to pregnancy, causes of acute <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain that may be more common due to the pregnant state or related to obstetrical complications, and the impact of the disease process on the fetus. Indicated diagnostic imaging and interventions should be performed since delay in diagnosis and treatment can increase maternal and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/newborn</span> morbidity and mortality.</p><p>This topic will review issues specific to the diagnostic evaluation and management of acute <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain in pregnant and postpartum women. The approach to acute <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain in other populations is discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1975404015\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES OF PREGNANCY THAT IMPACT DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy complicates the differential diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain because physiologic changes associated with pregnancy can mimic clinical features of <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/surgical</span> disorders associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain, thus creating diagnostic uncertainty. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early in pregnancy, stretching of the round ligament is a normal benign process that may be associated with mild pain (see <a href=\"#H1302966244\" class=\"local\">'Round ligament'</a> below). In the second half of pregnancy, especially the third trimester, <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> discomfort may be related to normal fetal position or movement, normal intermittent uterine contractions (Braxton-Hicks uterine contractions [ie, contractions not associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">labor/cervical</span> changes]), or normal uterine enlargement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, pain that is moderate or severe, associated with other symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, headache, fever), or confined to the upper abdomen suggests a disease process. The presence of peritoneal signs (rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding) is never normal in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These patients require prompt maternal-fetal evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting is a common feature of early pregnancy, and usually abates by 20 weeks of gestation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>). Nausea and vomiting is not a normal manifestation of pregnancy when it occurs with <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain, fever, diarrhea, headache, or localized <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> findings on physical examination. Nausea and vomiting in the second half of pregnancy should be considered abnormal and requires further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus becomes an abdominal organ, enlarging beyond the pelvis by 12 weeks of gestation. This enlargement may make it difficult to localize pain as it can impede physical examination, affect the normal location of pelvic and abdominal organs, and mask or delay peritoneal signs (rebound, guarding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The normal laxity of the abdominal wall in pregnancy may also diminish peritoneal signs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The enlarged uterus may compress the urinary tract, leading to hydroureter and hydronephrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and thus mimic some signs of nephrolithiasis.

This physiological change resolves with a change in position, but symptoms may be falsely attributed to internal bleeding from an acute disease process (eg, ruptured liver or spleen). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes#H1747300227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes&quot;, section on 'Postural hypotensive syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high maternal progesterone concentration during pregnancy decreases lower esophageal sphincter tone, small bowel and colonic motility, gallbladder emptying, and ureteral tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These physiologic changes are also important in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, cholelithiasis, and nephrolithiasis, all of which may be associated with abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic changes in hematologic parameters may mimic infection and occult hemorrhage, making diagnosis of these disorders more difficult:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>White cell counts increase to a normal range of 10,000 to 14,000 cells per mm<sup>3</sup> during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and in labor, the white cell count may be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 cells per mm<sup>3</sup>, returning to normal prepregnancy levels at approximately one week postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, bandemia is not a normal variant of pregnancy and its presence suggests infection until proven otherwise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A larger increase in plasma volume than in red cell volume results in physiologic anemia. The modest decrease in hemoglobin concentration (normal hemoglobin &ge;10.5 to 11.0 g per dL) coupled with the normal modest increase in heart rate (by 10 to 15 beats per minute) can be mistaken for signs of mild hemorrhage.

Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring is usually appropriate in pregnancies that have reached a gestational age with a reasonable chance of extrauterine survival (&ge;22 weeks of gestation). An abnormal fetal heart rate may be the direct consequence of a pregnancy-related cause of <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain (eg, placental abruption) or it may be an indirect consequence of maternal compromise (eg, hypotension, infection). In either case, fetal resuscitation is indicated, and urgent delivery may be appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonstress-test-and-contraction-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonstress test and contraction stress test&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the medical and surgical history, pregnant women should be asked about their past and current obstetrical history, as pregnancy complications may manifest as <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain (eg, preeclampsia may be associated with placental abruption or hepatic bleeding, previous cesarean delivery may be associated with uterine rupture) and complications often recur in subsequent pregnancies.</p><p>They should also be asked whether they have any vaginal bleeding or leaking of fluid. Bleeding in the first half of pregnancy may be related to miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Placental abruption and labor are common causes of <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain in the second half of pregnancy and often accompanied by vaginal bleeding and rupture of the fetal membranes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the etiology and evaluation of vaginal bleeding in pregnant women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-prelabor-rupture-of-membranes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The uterine examination should evaluate size (correlates with gestational age), tone, tenderness, and, in the second half of pregnancy, frequency of contractions. The uterus is normally nontender and soft, like any other relaxed muscle. A rigid or tender uterus in the second half of pregnancy suggests placental abruption, intrauterine infection, uterine rupture, or possibly labor. (See <a href=\"#H2677879\" class=\"local\">'Second half of pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>Cervical <span class=\"nowrap\">dilation/effacement</span> and whether the fetal membranes are intact should be assessed. Obstetric and non-obstetric disorders may cause uterine contractions, which may result in cervical change (labor). Rupture of membranes often leads to initiation of labor and may be associated with intrauterine infection or placental abruption. (See <a href=\"#H2677879\" class=\"local\">'Second half of pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15373027\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory tests can help narrow the differential diagnosis. In general, we suggest the following, unless a specific diagnosis is strongly suspected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with differential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver and pancreatic function tests (aminotransferases, bilirubin, amylase, lipase)</p><p/><p>Women with hemodynamic instability should have blood sent for coagulation studies and type and crossmatch. Electrolytes and renal function tests can be useful in women who are vomiting or anorectic. In the presence of fever or unstable vital signs, blood and urine cultures are performed, and may be helpful subsequently to confirm suspected infection and tailor antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15373132\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic imaging should be performed as indicated since delay in diagnosis and treatment can increase maternal and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/newborn</span> morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Ultrasound is typically the first-line modality for diagnostic imaging of the <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis</span> in pregnant women since it is widely available, portable, nonionizing, and its diagnostic performance is often adequate.</p><p>When ultrasound findings are equivocal or uncertain, the choice of the second-line modality depends on the differential diagnosis and should consider availability, diagnostic performance, and fetal radiation exposure. When indicated, use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferable to computed tomography (CT) because it avoids ionizing radiation and, for diagnosis of many disorders, performs as well as or better than CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, prompt diagnosis should not be delayed if MRI is not readily accessible. It is important to note that gadolinium crosses the placenta and may have potential harmful fetal effects. Therefore, the use of gadolinium is not recommended unless the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the potential risks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2678326\"><span class=\"h3\">Ionizing radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns about the possible fetal effects of ionizing radiation should not prevent performance of medically indicated diagnostic procedures during pregnancy using the best available modality for the clinical situation. A delay in diagnosis can increase the risk of an adverse maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal outcome.</p><p>When procedures requiring ionizing radiation are necessary (eg, trauma, bowel obstruction), radiologists should be familiar with various techniques beyond shielding the abdomen that can be employed to minimize the radiation dose. Almost all diagnostic radiological procedures are associated with exposures that are below the threshold for congenital malformations, growth restriction, or developmental delay. Whether there is a small increase in risk of carcinogenesis is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chest and abdominal radiographs are commonly used in evaluation of adults with abdominal pain. The estimated fetal absorption per chest radiograph is &lt;0.01 mGy (&lt;0.001 rad); this dose is well below doses that have been associated with any short- or long-term adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The estimated fetal absorption for abdominal radiographs is 1 to 4.2 mGy (0.1 to 0.42 rad), which is also below doses that have been associated with short- or long-term adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15373161\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopy is sometimes indicated in the evaluation of acute <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain, especially when the diagnosis is not clear after less invasive evaluations and the differential diagnoses include potentially life-threatening or organ-threatening disorders. It is usually performed in the first or second trimester, but is usually technically possible even in the early third trimester. Based on retrospective evaluation and survey data, laparoscopic surgery for evaluation of <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain in pregnancy appears to be as safe as laparotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-surgery-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When surgery is planned, the appropriate services (Obstetrics, General Surgery, Anesthesia, Pediatrics) should be consulted. Management of pregnant women undergoing surgery may require modifications to the approach used in nonpregnant women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal in the evaluation of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain is to quickly identify those who have a serious or even life-threatening etiology for their symptoms and require urgent intervention. Signs and symptoms that suggest a possible serious disease process include vaginal bleeding, new onset hypertension, hypotension, moderate or severe pain, vomiting, fever, and history of recent trauma.</p><p>We generally assess for pregnancy-related causes of pain first since these disorders are more likely to impact both mother and fetus. Vaginal bleeding and hypertension are key signs of a serious pregnancy-related cause of abdominal pain, but may be absent. A simple approach to differential diagnosis of serious pregnancy-related causes of abdominal pain is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112276\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112276 \">algorithm 1</a>). Hypotension suggests severe hemorrhage; in the absence of vaginal bleeding, the patient should be evaluated for rupture of an intraabdominal blood vessel or vascular organ (eg, perforated ulcer, splenic rupture). Patients who have experienced trauma should have a full trauma work-up (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>), with attention to pregnancy-related considerations.

Rarely, an ectopic pregnancy occurs concurrently with an intrauterine pregnancy; these heterotopic pregnancies can be difficult to diagnose. A pregnancy conceived via assisted reproductive technology (eg, in vitro fertilization [IVF]) is a strong risk factor.</p><p>Clinical manifestations are usually related to free blood in the peritoneal cavity due to extrauterine pregnancy rupture or bleeding, and vary depending upon the location. Abdominal pain is a common symptom of all types of extrauterine pregnancy; vaginal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting may also occur. Blood in the peritoneal cavity can be identified by ultrasound examination of the pelvis and abdomen or culdocentesis (rarely performed). Patients may present with tachycardia, hypotension, low grade temperature, and a mild elevation in the white cell count.</p><p>The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is usually based upon results from ultrasound examination in the early first trimester and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone testing. Rarely, ectopic pregnancies progress to the second or third trimester; these pregnancies are typically attached to abdominal viscera (uterine serosa, adnexa, parametrium, liver, spleen, bowel, omentum).</p><p>All pregnant patients who present with lower abdominal pain with or without vaginal bleeding should undergo ultrasound examination to determine the location of the pregnancy, unless an intrauterine location has already been documented.

The most frequent initial symptoms are nausea or vomiting (approximately 75 percent of patients), abdominal pain (particularly epigastric, 50 percent), anorexia, and jaundice. As discussed above, nausea and vomiting during the second half of pregnancy should be considered abnormal and requires further evaluation. Approximately one-half of patients have signs of preeclampsia at presentation or at some time during the course of illness.</p><p>The diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy is usually made clinically based upon the setting, presentation, and compatible laboratory and imaging results. Laboratory test findings may show elevated aminotransferases, elevated bilirubin, thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, low glucose levels, increased uric acid levels, increased creatinine levels, and elevated white cell count. Imaging tests of the liver are primarily used to exclude other diagnoses, such as a hepatic infarct or hematoma, although some authors have reported finding fat on ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Hepatic rupture is rare.

The most common symptom of appendicitis (ie, right lower quadrant pain) occurs maximally within a few centimeters of McBurney's point (1.5 to 2 inches from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) on a straight line from the ASIS to the umbilicus) in the vast majority of pregnant women, regardless of the stage of pregnancy. The clinical diagnosis should be strongly suspected in pregnant women with classic findings: abdominal pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, right lower quadrant tenderness, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> fever, and leukocytosis with left shift. However, pregnant women are less likely to have a classic presentation of appendicitis than nonpregnant women, especially in late pregnancy. The location of the appendix migrates a few centimeters cephalad with the enlarging uterus, so in the third trimester, pain may localize to the mid or even the upper right side of the abdomen, and tenderness at that point may be less prominent than in nonpregnant women.</p><p>Graded compression ultrasonography is the first-line imaging modality. The primary goal of imaging is to reduce delays in surgical intervention due to diagnostic uncertainty. A secondary goal is to reduce, but not eliminate, the negative appendectomy rate.

The right ovarian vein is more commonly involved than the left (80 versus 6 percent); bilateral involvement occurs in 14 percent of cases. Pelvic tenderness may reflect OVT or an alternative diagnosis such as endometritis. Nausea, ileus, and other gastrointestinal symptoms may occur, but are usually mild, which may be helpful in distinguishing right-sided OVT from appendicitis, pyelonephritis, or other processes.

(See <a href=\"#H1975404015\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic changes of pregnancy that impact differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the usual diagnostic evaluation of adults with abdominal pain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>), key points in evaluation of pregnant women include assessment of gestational age and fetal heart rate, past and current obstetrical history, vaginal bleeding, amniotic fluid leakage, and cervical and uterine status. (See <a href=\"#H15372999\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the evaluation is to quickly identify those who have a serious or even life-threatening etiology for their symptoms and require urgent intervention. Signs and symptoms that suggest a possible serious disease process include vaginal bleeding, new onset hypertension, hypotension, moderate or severe pain, vomiting, fever and history of recent trauma. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt consultation with an obstetrician should be sought when a pregnant patient with abdominal pain is evaluated in the emergency department. We generally assess for pregnancy-related causes of pain first since these disorders are more likely to impact both mother and fetus. Vaginal bleeding and hypertension are key signs of a potentially serious pregnancy-related cause of abdominal pain, but may be absent. A basic initial approach to differential diagnosis of serious pregnancy-related causes of abdominal pain is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F112276\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112276 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and constipation can be a normal part of pregnancy, peritoneal signs (rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding) are never normal in pregnant women. Nausea and vomiting are not normal manifestations of advanced pregnancy (after 20 weeks) and, when they occur with abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, headache, or localized abdominal findings, require a thorough evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H1975404015\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic changes of pregnancy that impact differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Requisite diagnostic imaging and interventions should be performed as indicated since delay in diagnosis and treatment can increase maternal and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/newborn</span> morbidity and mortality. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examinations are the most useful tests for evaluation of abdominal pain in pregnant women. These examinations are safe for the fetus and perform well for making and excluding most diagnoses associated with abdominal pain. When indicated, chest and abdominal plain films result in very low fetal absorption of ionizing radiation, and below doses that have been associated with short- or long-term adverse effects. Magnetic resonance imaging does not involve ionizing radiation and thus is preferable to computed tomography, which exposes the fetus to higher doses of ionizing radiation than plain films.
