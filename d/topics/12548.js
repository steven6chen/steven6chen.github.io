The extent of enzyme inhibition varies among the different NSAIDs, although there are no studies relating the degree of COX inhibition with antiinflammatory efficacy in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two related isoforms of the COX enzyme have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]: COX-1 (PGHS-1) and COX-2 (PGHS-2). They possess 60 percent homology in those amino acid sequences apparently conserved for catalysis of arachidonic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. The most important differences between the two isoforms are the regulation and expression of the enzymes in various tissues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-1 is expressed in most tissues, but variably. It is described as a &quot;housekeeping&quot; enzyme, regulating normal cellular processes (such as gastric cytoprotection, vascular homeostasis, platelet aggregation, and kidney function), and it is stimulated by hormones or growth factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the brain, in the kidney, in bone, and probably in the female reproductive system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Its expression at other sites is increased during states of inflammation or, experimentally, in response to mitogenic stimuli. As an example, growth factors, phorbol esters, and interleukin (IL)-1 stimulate the expression of COX-2 in fibroblasts, while endotoxin serves the same function in <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both COX isoforms are regulated by physiologic stimuli, including shear stress in the vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and ovulation and implantation in the female reproductive tract of rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the human kidney, in nonphysiologic states such as diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, bone fracture, and heart failure, increased expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein has been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The clinical relevance of this is not yet clear.</p><p/><p>Thus, differences in the extent to which a particular NSAID inhibits an isoform of COX may affect both its activity and toxicity. It has been proposed that the perfect NSAID would inhibit the inducible COX-2 isoform (thereby decreasing inflammation) without having any effect on the constitutive COX-1 isoform (thereby minimizing toxicity). Such an agent would maximize effectiveness without inducing toxicity, particularly gastroduodenal erosions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most traditional NSAIDs are nonselective inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All three were approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, while rofecoxib and celecoxib were also approved for use in acute pain. Rofecoxib was withdrawn worldwide by the manufacturer due to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events seen in a placebo-controlled trial. Valdecoxib was also withdrawn from the United States and European Union markets in April 2005. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other selective COX-2 inhibitors that are being actively investigated include etoricoxib and lumiracoxib. Parecoxib, a water soluble prodrug that is metabolized to valdecoxib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], seems unlikely to be commercially developed following the withdrawal of valdecoxib.</p><p>The selective COX-2 inhibitors demonstrate at least a 200- to 300-fold selectivity for inhibition of COX-2 over COX-1 at the defined therapeutic doses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82145 \">figure 2</a>). They provide comparable analgesia to the nonspecific NSAIDs among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and several benefits, particularly a reduction in gastroduodenal toxicity (since COX-1 is involved in gastric cytoprotection). However, the one remaining agent in this class, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, never received approval from the FDA to be marketed as safer on the gastrointestinal system. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have not been approved for use in children.</p><p>An overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors will be presented here. Their use in specific disorders is discussed separately. (See appropriate topics).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal benefit with the selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors is the production of comparable analgesia and antiinflammatory effects to the nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but with fewer symptomatic gastric and duodenal ulcers and a decrease in gastrointestinal symptoms. An additional possible benefit is protection against the development of colon cancer; this has yet to be clearly shown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia and antiinflammatory activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Celecoxib</a> was approved based upon the results of five clinical trials (some of which have been published only in preliminary form) involving more than 5200 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in which its efficacy and toxicity were compared with nonselective NSAIDs and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. One of the published studies included a total of 688 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who completed a controlled trial comparing various doses of celecoxib with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> or placebo for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. All doses of celecoxib and naproxen improved signs and symptoms of arthritis compared with placebo. Similar results were found in a second study of 655 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which compared the efficacy and gastrointestinal toxicity of celecoxib versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Celecoxib</a> is also as efficacious as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoprofen</a> in ankylosing spondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-treatment-of-ankylosing-spondylitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rofecoxib had equivalent efficacy in patients with osteoarthritis to that of nonselective NSAIDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>], and to that of the selective COX-2 inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Rofecoxib (12.5 mg daily) was both more efficacious and had a more rapid onset of action than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabumetone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabumetone</a> (500 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Its efficacy was similar to that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, as noted above, rofecoxib was withdrawn worldwide by the manufacturer due to increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.</p><p>Valdecoxib had approximately the same efficacy in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>; American College of Rheumatology 20 percent (ACR20) response rates of about 50 percent were noted for both agents from week 2 through week 12 compared with 30 to 36 percent for placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Valdecoxib doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg per day were equally efficacious. Likewise, valdecoxib appears to be equivalent in efficacy to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> as assessed in a study of 722 patients with RA who were randomly assigned to valdecoxib (either 20 or 40 mg per day) or diclofenac (75 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, like rofecoxib, valdecoxib has been removed from the market due to an apparent increase in the risk of cardiovascular events and allergic reactions associated with its use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lumiracoxib is a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor that is efficacious at doses of 100 mg to 400 mg daily for osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. It does not contain a sulfonamide or sulfone moiety. It is approved for use in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Etoricoxib is another highly selective COX-2 inhibitor. In a randomized trial that compared etoricoxib (30 mg daily) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (800 mg three times daily) and with placebo in 528 patients with osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], a beneficial effect of treatment was apparent by two weeks of treatment. Etoricoxib was significantly more effective than placebo and similar to ibuprofen in the amount of pain relief and improvement in patient global assessment. Drug-related adverse events were significantly more frequent in those receiving ibuprofen when compared with the placebo group, but there was no significant difference between the ibuprofen and etoricoxib groups. Larger long-term studies are underway to address the cardiovascular safety of etoricoxib.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in gastroduodenal toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy and relative reduction in gastroduodenal toxicity of all of the selective COX-2 inhibitors when compared with nonselective NSAIDs. Detailed information regarding these trials is presented elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-inhibitors-and-gastroduodenal-toxicity-major-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 inhibitors and gastroduodenal toxicity: Major clinical trials&quot;</a>). The range of findings can be briefly summarized by the following observations, which address the relative frequency of ulceration detected by surveillance endoscopy and of adverse clinical gastrointestinal events:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Representative of the results from surveillance endoscopy is a trial in which 688 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned to various doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, or placebo for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. All doses of celecoxib and naproxen improved signs and symptoms of arthritis compared with placebo. The incidence of endoscopically determined gastroduodenal ulcers among patients taking celecoxib was similar to that of those taking placebo (approximately 4 percent) and significantly lower than that of those taking naproxen (26 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58850 \">figure 3</a>). However, it is not clear that endoscopic results are a surrogate for an endpoint that includes ulcer complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcer symptoms and complications were the focus of a prospective trial (CLASS study) involving 8059 patients that found <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> to be significantly associated with a reduced incidence of a combined outcome (symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications) compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, celecoxib was associated with a decrease in liver toxicity, hypertension, and edema compared with the nonselective NSAIDS. At the final study endpoint (one year), there was no statistically significant reduction in ulcers and their complications among patients taking celecoxib. There was substantial patient dropout, making the final study time point difficult to interpret.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effect of rofecoxib on adverse clinical gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers) was evaluated in a trial (VIGOR study) of 8076 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were randomly assigned to rofecoxib or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At a median follow-up of nine months, significantly fewer events occurred in the rofecoxib group (2.1 versus 4.5 per 100 patient-years, relative risk [RR] 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.6).</p><p/><p>A possible concern of selective COX-2 inhibition is the potential to delay healing of gastric erosions or ulcers, an effect that has been observed in mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although neither a clinically significant nor statistically significant delay in healing of ulcers was observed in the clinical trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, approximately 40 percent of the patients included in the trials were required to be free of ulcers prior to study entry. In addition, studies on rofecoxib excluded patients with active peptic ulcer disease. Thus, it is still unclear whether the COX-2 inhibitors may induce damage to the gastrointestinal tract, even though there may be no effects on COX-1 activity in vivo at any therapeutic dose. Instead, the observed gastrointestinal effects of the Selective COX-2 inhibitors may be due to the drug effect on healing of ulcers induced through other pathologic effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of low-dose aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential gastroduodenal sparing effect with selective COX-2 agents may be counterbalanced by toxicity from concurrent low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. As an example, similar rates of ulcers and ulcer complications were noted among those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> plus low-dose aspirin as were those among patients receiving a nonselective NSAID plus aspirin (2.02 and 2.12 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, the value of selective COX-2 inhibitors in patients who require aspirin therapy for cardiovascular protection is less clear. If one decides to pursue use of an NSAID or selective COX-2 inhibitor in a patient requiring concomitant aspirin therapy, then consideration should be given to using a proton pump inhibitor prophylactically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#H1898937\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer&quot;, section on 'Bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>The effect of combining a COX-2 inhibitor with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> was investigated in a large study that compared rofecoxib with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The combination of rofecoxib (25 mg per day) and aspirin was not associated with an increased incidence of dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, other gastrointestinal symptoms, or a significantly different rate of discontinuation when compared with the use of rofecoxib alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Unfortunately, the relative risk of serious adverse side effects in those using the selective COX-2 inhibitor alone or with aspirin could not be definitively addressed due to the small number of such events (11 in 5557 patients followed for three months) and the post hoc nature of the analysis of the aspirin versus non-aspirin-using subgroups.</p><p>A similar abrogation of the gastrointestinal sparing effect was seen when lumiracoxib was combined with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible prevention of colon cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have documented an association between the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other NSAIDs and a reduced risk of colorectal adenomas; this reduction in risk extends to colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The evidence supporting these associations is provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Role in prevention of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One possible mechanism by which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> NSAIDs may prevent colon cancer is the inhibition of COX-2. Studies in human colon cancer have shown increased COX-2 expression when compared with the adjacent colonic mucosa; similar observations have been made in experimental models of colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. COX-2 expression may also increase the metastatic potential of colon cancer cells and possibly influence patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In one study, for example, COX-2 expression was determined in 76 patients with a variety of stages of colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Ten-year survival was significantly higher in patients with the lowest levels of COX-2 staining (68 versus 35 percent).</p><p>These findings suggest that COX-2 activation may promote tumor growth. Consistent with this hypothesis is a study in which human colon cancer cells that expressed high levels of COX-2 were implanted into nude mice; treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduced tumor formation by 85 to 90 percent and inhibited colony formation of cultured cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This benefit was not seen with tumor cells that lacked COX-2.</p><p>There may also be an interaction between COX-2 inhibition and the induction of apoptosis. In one report, the ras mutation (found in 50 percent of colorectal carcinomas) made rat intestinal epithelial cells more resistant to spontaneous apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The ras-transformed cells also had increased expression of COX-2. Administration of a COX-2 selective antagonist impaired the growth of these cells by both inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. However, in another study, a different COX-2 selective antagonist induced apoptosis in a colorectal cancer cell line that lacked detectable COX-2 expression, suggesting that COX-2 selective NSAIDs may induce apoptosis via mechanisms that do not involve COX-2, or it may be the result of a combination of these effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>A controlled trial involving 83 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) suggested that one of the COX-2 inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> 400 mg twice daily) was associated with a 28 percent reduction in rectal polyps. These data led a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel to recommend the drug for approval in patients with phenotypic expression of FAP (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-adenomatous-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis&quot;</a>). The data from the selective COX-2 inhibitor non-familial adenomatous polyp prevention trials APPROVe and APC are still awaited.</p><p>However, increased rates of cardiovascular events have been noted in some primary prevention trials that utilized the selective COX-2 inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> and rofecoxib. The cardiovascular risks associated with COX-2 selective agents, including the results of the polyp prevention trials, are presented in detail separately.

Since production of the potent prostanoid, thromboxane A2, is dependent upon COX-1, inhibition of COX-2 alone should produce little or no effect upon platelet function.

However, the 400 mg twice-daily dose is reserved for patients with familial colonic adenomatous polyposis, and this dose has been shown to decrease both the incidence and size of these polyps.

Risk factors for NSAID-related gastroduodenal toxicity include age &gt;65 years, use of an anticoagulant (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, low molecular weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>), prior gastrointestinal bleed, active peptic ulcer disease, and concomitant use of oral glucocorticoids. If any of these risk factors are present, then one should reconsider whether NSAID therapy is advised and consider other analgesic options (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, low-potency opioids, joint protection with a cane or brace, musculoskeletal injections, or orthopedic interventions). If NSAID therapy is being considered in a patient with risk factors for NSAID-related gastroduodenal toxicity, there are three safer options: an NSAID with a proton pump inhibitor, an NSAID with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, or a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor (with or without a proton pump inhibitor). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with known coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease who require concomitant therapy with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> should only receive a selective COX-2 inhibitor after full disclosure of their possible cardiovascular risks. The safety of nonselective NSAIDs in this patient group has not been established, but they may pose similar cardiovascular risks to the selective COX-2 inhibitors. Patients receiving low-dose aspirin may require prophylaxis to prevent gastroduodenal damage.
