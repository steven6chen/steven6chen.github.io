For depressed patients, there is time for clinicians, patients, and families to discuss the use of medications and for patients and families to review the information to make informed decisions. Although suicidal behavior is a medical emergency, the emergent administration of antidepressants has no role in the acute management of suicidal youth because antidepressants generally do not take effect for at least two to four weeks.

Education is part of obtaining assent from patients and informed consent from the parents or guardians. </p><p>Education about pharmacotherapy should be developmentally appropriate for the patient's level of understanding. In addition, education involves the families as partners of the treatment team and helps them understand the symptoms, causes, and treatment of depression; identify and manage dysphoria in the patient; address psychosocial deficits; and learn the importance of adherence with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinical features and diagnosis of depression are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric unipolar depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Discussion about the safety of antidepressants should include the United States Food and Drug Administration boxed warning in medication package inserts regarding suicidal ideation and behavior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54498\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54498 \">table 7</a>). The warning requires clinicians to discuss its content before prescribing the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. One of the driving forces behind this warning was that parents have the right to know about potential side effects, and a sense that clinicians were not properly monitoring the use of these medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of antidepressants on suicide risk in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'FDA black box warning'</a>.)</p><p>Patients and families should also be educated about the high risk of morbidity and mortality from untreated depression. Following the advent of boxed warnings about antidepressants and suicidal ideation and behavior, studies of antidepressants in pediatric patients have concluded that the benefits of antidepressants under ordinary clinical circumstances outweigh the potential risk of suicidal ideation and behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The adverse effects of untreated depression include the risk of suicide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal behavior in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patient and family education about aspects of depression that are not specifically related to pharmacotherapy are discussed elsewhere in this topic and in other topics.

Clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of unipolar major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>) or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91114\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91114 \">table 2</a>) by ensuring that the diagnostic criteria (including functional impairment) are met and that other psychiatric disorders (eg, bipolar disorder or psychotic prodrome) are excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In addition, patients often have significant symptoms of depression with functional impairment that warrant pharmacotherapy, but fail to meet the full criteria for major depression. The term &quot;Other specified depressive disorder&quot; is used to describe this condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric unipolar depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosing depressive disorders'</a>.)</p><p>Confirming the diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorders includes ruling out bipolar disorder by checking for a past history of mania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106 \">table 8</a>) and hypomania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107 \">table 9</a>), as well as a family history of bipolar disorder. Episodes of major depression usually precede the onset of manic and hypomanic episodes in bipolar disorder; thus, youth who initially present with a depressive syndrome may actually have bipolar disorder. Patients with known bipolar disorder should not receive antidepressant monotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness#H6530627\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness&quot;, section on 'Major depression'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis#H190481623\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the evaluation should address comorbidity such as substance use disorders.

For pediatric patients who are candidates for an SSRI, no pretreatment laboratory evaluation is necessary other than a urine pregnancy test in postpubertal females who are not using reliable contraception. The effects of SSRIs in pregnancy are discussed separately.

For patients with a personal history of cardiac disease or a family history of premature (&lt;40 years of age) cardiac problems, a pediatric cardiology consult is warranted before starting tricyclics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In youth who are candidates for treatment with tricyclics, the pretreatment physical examination and laboratory tests include weight, blood pressure, pulse, and a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Tricyclics should not be initiated unless these parameters are within the normal limits for the child's age, sex, and height. Additional baseline tests include a pregnancy test for postpubertal females who are not using reliable contraception. &#160;</p><p>Additional information about the baseline cardiac evaluation that is performed prior to initiating tricyclics and the effects of tricyclics in pregnancy are discussed separately.

The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire has a separate form that is completed by the patient and the parent; the questionnaire is validated for both children and adolescents and is in the public domain. However, there is no evidence that using such scales improves outcomes in pediatric depression. Additional information about measurement based care is discussed separately in the context of adults.

The schedule is based upon the severity of the depressive syndrome, level of social support, and the presence of comorbidity, adverse effects, and stressors (eg, break-up with girlfriend, death of a close relative, or poor school performance). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358130\"><span class=\"h3\">Tricyclics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricyclics are rarely used to treat pediatric depression.

If cardiac parameters are outside the normal limits for age, sex, and height during therapy with tricyclics (particularly patients who are hypotensive or tachycardic), patients should have their dose decreased and testing repeated (in two weeks for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> and one week for all other tricyclics).

In addition, we suggest that clinicians adjust the dose, or switch to a different SSRI or a drug from a different antidepressant class, consistent with guidelines from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63001\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63001 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358151\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCONTINUING PHARMACOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacotherapy for pediatric depression generally lasts for at least 6 to 12 months after remission.

A taper of approximately 25 to 50 percent per week provides a gradual decrease that allows the body time to adjust to the lower dose. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> 200 mg per day can be decreased to 150 mg per day for week one, 100 mg per day for week two, 50 mg per day for week three, and 25 mg per day for week four, after which the medication is stopped. </p><p>Abrupt discontinuation of SSRIs can cause a discontinuation (withdrawal) syndrome marked by: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myalgias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea</p><p/><p>Discontinuation symptoms may occur after just six to eight weeks of therapy.
