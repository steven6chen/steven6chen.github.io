Sore throat usually resolves on its own without complications in adults, although it is important to know when to seek medical attention.</p><p>Viruses can cause a sore throat and other upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold. Sore throat caused by a virus is not treated with antibiotics but instead may be treated with rest, pain medication, and other therapies aimed at relieving symptoms.</p><p>Strep throat is a particular kind of pharyngitis that is caused by a bacterium known as group A <em>Streptococcus </em>(GAS). Strep throat is treated with a course of antibiotics.</p><p>A topic that discusses sore throat in children is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sore throat in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SORE THROAT SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral pharyngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with a sore throat have a virus. The most common viruses are those that cause upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The common cold in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of a viral infection can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A runny or congested nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritation or redness of the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough, hoarseness, or soreness in the roof of the mouth</p><p/><p>Some viruses cause a fever and can make you feel quite ill.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Strep throat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of adults with a sore throat have strep throat.

There is no specific treatment for a sore throat caused by usual cold viruses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Is it strep or not?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A combination of symptoms (fever, enlarged glands in the neck, white patches on your tonsils, and no cough) can help in determining if you have strep. If you have two or more symptoms, a rapid test or throat culture may be done. People with fewer than two symptoms usually do not need testing or treatment for strep throat, though they may benefit from treatment with modalities for symptom reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapid test determines if there are <em>Streptococcus </em>bacteria on a throat swab. The test may be done in a clinician's office, and the results are available within a few minutes. The test is accurate in most cases, although a small percentage of tests are falsely negative (the bacteria are present but the test is negative) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sore-throat-in-adults-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Throat culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A throat culture involves swabbing the throat, sending the swab to a laboratory, and waiting 24 to 48 hours for the results. Throat cultures are slightly more accurate than the rapid test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF SORE THROAT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sore throat treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics do not help throat pain caused by a virus and are not recommended. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for viral illness can unnecessarily expose patients to side effects like diarrhea, rash, or more serious allergic reactions. Sore throat caused by viral infections usually lasts four to five days. During this time, treatments to reduce pain may be helpful. Several therapies can help to relieve throat pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent such as ibuprofen or naproxen (Motrin or Aleve) have been shown to provide fast and effective relief of sore throat pain.</p><p>Oral steroids are not routinely used because steroids come with (potentially serious) side effects, the benefit in treating sore throat pain is limited, and over-the-counter treatments help most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral rinses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salt-water gargles are an old standby for throat pain. It is not clear that salt water works to relieve pain, but it is unlikely to be harmful. Most recipes suggest <span class=\"nowrap\">1/4</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> teaspoon (1.5 to 3.0 g) of salt per one cup (8 ounces or 250 mL) of warm water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Sprays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sprays containing topical anesthetics (eg, benzocaine, phenol) are available to treat sore throat. However, such sprays are no more effective than sucking on hard candy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Lozenges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of lozenges (cough drops) containing topical anesthetics are available to treat throat pain or relieve dryness. Lozenges may persist longer in the throat than sprays or gargles and, thus, may be more effective for symptom relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sore-throat-in-adults-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Other treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other treatments that may help with throat pain include sipping warm beverages (eg, honey or lemon tea, chicken soup), cold beverages, or eating cold or frozen desserts (eg, ice cream, popsicles).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health food stores, vitamin outlets, and internet websites offer alternative treatments for relief of sore throat pain. We do not recommend these type of treatments due to the risks of contamination with <span class=\"nowrap\">pesticides/herbicides,</span> inaccurate labeling and dosing information, and a lack of studies showing that these treatments are safe and effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Strep throat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although strep throat typically resolves on its own within two to five days, treatment with antibiotics is recommended for adults whose rapid test or throat culture is positive for strep throat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sore-throat-in-adults-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Penicillin, or an antibiotic related to penicillin, is the treatment of choice for strep throat. It is usually given in pill or liquid form two to four times per day for 10 days. A one-time injection of penicillin is also available. People who are allergic to penicillin are given an alternate antibiotic. It is important to finish the entire course of treatment to completely eliminate the infection.</p><p>If symptoms do not begin to improve or worsen by three days of antibiotic treatment, you should see your doctor or nurse again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Return to work/school</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have been diagnosed with strep throat, stay home from work or school until you have completed 24 hours of antibiotics. Within 24 hours of beginning antibiotic treatment, you will feel better and will be less contagious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sore-throat-in-adults-beyond-the-basics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>If you have a sore throat (not diagnosed as strep), you may participate in your usual activities as soon as you feel well, though practical prevention measures such as good hand washing and cough etiquette should be observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SORE THROAT PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hand washing is an essential and highly effective way to prevent the spread of infection. Wet your hands with water and plain soap, and rub them together for 15 to 30 seconds. Pay special attention to the fingernails, between the fingers, and the wrists. Rinse your hands thoroughly, and dry them with a clean towel.</p><p>Alcohol-based hand rubs are a good alternative for disinfecting hands if a sink is not available. Hand rubs should be spread over the entire surface of hands, fingers, and wrists until dry and may be used several times. These rubs can be used repeatedly without skin irritation or loss of effectiveness. Hand rubs are available as a liquid or wipe in small, portable sizes that are easy to carry in a pocket or handbag. When a sink is available, visibly soiled hands should be washed with soap and water.</p><p>Wash your hands after coughing, blowing the nose, or sneezing. While it is not always possible to avoid being near a person who is sick, avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth to prevent the spread of infection.</p><p>In addition, tissues should be used to cover the mouth when sneezing or coughing. These used tissues should be disposed of promptly. <span class=\"nowrap\">Sneezing/coughing</span> into your sleeve (at the inner elbow) is another way to contain sprays of saliva and secretions and will not contaminate your hands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4013\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
