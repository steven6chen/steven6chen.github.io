They may involve one, two, or more chromosomes and may involve only part of a chromosome or the whole chromosome. Congenital anomalies, growth deficiency, and intellectual disability are findings often present in individuals with chromosome abnormalities, although some cytogenetic aberrations have little to no clinical effect. Rapid progress in human cytogenetics has demonstrated a causal relationship between various chromosomal abnormalities and their phenotypic manifestations. In addition, the specific chromosomal etiologies of a wide variety of syndromes have been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromosomal-translocations-deletions-and-inversions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromosomal translocations, deletions, and inversions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews the most common chromosomal abnormalities and discusses when to refer a <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/parent</span> for a genetic evaluation. Diseases caused by point mutations and other small genetic defects are discussed elsewhere.

Cytogenetic abnormalities are more common in spontaneous abortions (50 percent of fetal deaths &lt;20 weeks) than in stillbirths (6 to 13 percent of fetal deaths &ge;20 weeks). A 1998 multicenter survey of 103,069 live births in the United States identified major chromosomal abnormalities in 1 in 140 live births (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52347 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities is dependent upon the sample and population studied and the type of diagnostic testing used. As an example, the incidence is lower among live births than among abortuses, second trimester fetuses, or stillbirths. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) remains the most common chromosomal abnormality among liveborn infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities by conventional karyotyping has several limitations compared with a subsequently developed technique based upon microarray analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. As an example, analysis of macerated fetuses and nonviable tissues from spontaneous abortions and stillbirths has low yield. In addition, chromosome banding techniques can only detect major structural abnormalities. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) can detect smaller copy number variations (eg, DNA gains and losses) and has a higher yield when performed on fetal tissue from pregnancy losses. Thus, aCGH may become the preferred type of testing to analyze fetal loss as it becomes more readily available, less costly, and easier to perform. The use of aCGH in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and postnatal evaluation of pregnancy loss is discussed in detail separately.

A comparison of amniocentesis and liveborn data regarding the incidence of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75423 \">table 2</a>). The maternal age-specific rate of trisomy 21, as well as other chromosomal abnormalities, is approximately 30 percent higher when diagnosed in the early second trimester by amniocenteses than when diagnosed after birth. These differences can be explained, in part, by an increased late spontaneous fetal loss rate (after the early second trimester) for fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>A European study of 21 population-based registries for the epidemiologic surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT) that included 6.1 million births from 1990 to 2009 revealed an increase in total prevalence of trisomy 21 over time to 22 in 10,000 (1 in 455) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This change was attributed to an increase in the proportion of births in population to mothers aged 35 years and older from 13 percent in 1990 to 19 percent in 2009. At the same time, the live-birth prevalence of trisomies 13, 18, and 21 remained stable overall (1 in 20,830 for trisomy 13, 1 in 9614 for trisomy 18, and 1 in 890 for trisomy 21). The stable live-birth prevalence compared with the rise in total prevalence is most likely due to increased prenatal screening and pregnancy termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], as well as an increase in fetal loss rate in trisomy pregnancies with advancing maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>There is no national registry for Down syndrome or other birth defects in the United States. Thus, the exact number of trisomy 21 live births in the United States is unknown. Data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated an increase of trisomy 21 live births by 24 percent, from 1 in 1053 during the period from 1979 to 1983 to 1 in 847 from the years 1999 to 2003. In comparison, a decrease in trisomy 21 live births, from 1 in 900 in 1989 to 1 in 1070 in 2006, was seen in data based upon birth certificates from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The highest prevalence reported was from the 1998 multicenter United States survey, with a rate of 1 in 730 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Data from spontaneous abortuses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-half of spontaneous abortions have an abnormal chromosomal complement (on Giemsa [G]-banded karyotyping), which is the probable etiology of the pregnancy loss.

The cause of trisomy 16 in almost all zygotes is nondisjunction in maternal meiosis I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Embryos with full trisomy 16 are spontaneously aborted or have arrested development between 8 to 15 weeks' gestational age. Some survive beyond this gestational age and are diagnosed prenatally by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis. These surviving embryos are virtually always mosaic as a result of trisomy rescue, a process in which one of the trisomic chromosomes is lost during mitotic cell division [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Data from stillbirths and neonatal deaths</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stillbirth in the United States is defined as a fetal loss at a gestational age greater than 20 weeks, whereas neonatal death refers to death occurring within the first four weeks after a live birth.</p><p>In one series, karyotyping of a combined group of 823 stillbirths and neonatal deaths found a major chromosomal abnormality in 6.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The frequency of abnormal karyotype in macerated stillbirths (deaths occurring during pregnancy), nonmacerated or fresh stillbirths (deaths occurring during labor or delivery), and neonatal deaths was approximately 12, 4, and 6 percent, respectively. The abnormalities reported were mostly comprised of trisomies 18, 13, and 21; sex chromosome aneuploidy; and unbalanced translocations. The frequency of chromosomal abnormality in this combined group was approximately 10-fold higher than the incidence of 0.7 percent observed in live births. In another series of 750 intrauterine fetal deaths, chromosomal abnormalities visible on G-banded karyotyping were identified in 38 and 5 percent of fetuses with and without morphologic abnormalities, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In fresh stillbirths with chromosomal abnormalities, sex chromosome abnormalities were observed in 20 percent, autosomal trisomies in 70 percent, and balanced structural rearrangements in 10 percent. In neonatal deaths, the type and frequency of chromosomal abnormalities were broader: monosomy X (7 percent), other sex chromosomal abnormalities (10 percent), autosomal trisomies (55 percent), triploidy (3 percent), balanced structural rearrangement (7 percent), unbalanced structural rearrangement (16 percent), and other unspecified chromosome abnormality (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetuses with congenital anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities visible by G-banded karyotyping in fetuses with congenital anomalies ranges from 2 to 35 percent, with the highest rate in fetuses with multiple anomalies as opposed to an isolated anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk of chromosomal abnormality also varies according to the type of isolated anomaly.

In approximately 90 percent of cases, the extra chromosome 21 originates from the mother. This explains, in part, why the risk of this type of Down syndrome increases with advancing maternal age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75423 \">table 2</a>). The recurrence rate is approximately 1 percent in younger women; the maternal age-related risk is used if it is greater than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

A slightly higher rate (approximately 11 percent) of a paternally derived extra copy of chromosome 21 is seen in cases of trisomy 21 diagnosed prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In Down syndrome patients with an unbalanced Robertsonian translocation, the entire long arm of one chromosome 21 is translocated to the long arm of an acrocentric chromosome (ie, chromosome 13, 14, 15, 21, or 22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The most common form of this translocation involves chromosomes 14 and 21 [46,der(14;21)(q10;q10),+21]. These individuals have 46 chromosomes, but one chromosome 14 contains the long arms of both chromosomes 14 and 21. Therefore, they actually have three copies of the long arm of chromosome 21 (two normal chromosome 21s and a third long arm translocated to chromosome 14), which results in Down syndrome. Trisomy 21 resulting from a Robertsonian translocation is not related to maternal age.</p><p>A parental carrier of a balanced Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 21, eg, 45,der(14;21)(q10;q10), has an observed risk as high as 15 percent of having an offspring born with an unbalanced translocation resulting in Down syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81746 \">figure 1</a>). The risk is highest if the mother, rather than the father, is the translocation carrier (10 to 15 versus 2 to 5 percent). However, the majority of translocations resulting in Down syndrome occur de novo, with only 3 to 4 percent having a familial etiology.

The inv dup(15) markers are classified as two subtypes based upon breakpoint on the long (q) arm: a small inv dup(15) with the break at 15q11 and a large inv dup(15) containing the <span class=\"nowrap\">Prader-Willi/Angelman</span> critical region (PWACR), with the break at 15q12 or q13. The small inv dup (15)(q11) can be inherited or de novo. In two large studies, the inv dup(15) accounted for 57 and 25 percent of all markers detected in 39,105 and 100,000 prenatal diagnoses, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].</p><p>The majority of carriers have a normal phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>], with some exceptions<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].
