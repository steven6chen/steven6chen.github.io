Treatment is aimed at relieving local symptoms and preventing thromboembolic complications.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins are reviewed here. Phlebitis and thrombosis involving upper extremity veins most often occurs in the context of upper extremity venous cannulation, and is discussed separately.

Superficial phlebitis is usually an initial clinical diagnosis, referring to the clinical findings of pain, tenderness, induration, and erythema along the course of a superficial vein. It is due to inflammation, which may be accompanied by thrombosis, and less commonly, infection of the vein. If thrombus is apparent as a thickened cord or subsequently identified with imaging studies (often the case), the terms superficial thrombophlebitis or superficial vein thrombosis are preferred. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25234576\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial thrombophlebitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The more frequent use of duplex ultrasound has allowed the distinction of thrombophlebitis from phlebitis by confirming the presence or absence of thrombus within a vein. Although the term superficial thrombophlebitis can refer to any vein, in the lower extremity, we prefer to limit this term to the presence of symptoms of venous inflammation and confirmed thrombosis of the tributary veins, reserving the term superficial vein thrombosis for inflammation and thrombosis of the axial veins (eg, great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25234582\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial vein thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recognition that thrombosis of the axial veins (eg, great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein) can lead to thromboembolism, particularly when the more proximal vein is affected, has led to the use of the term &quot;superficial vein thrombosis&quot; (SVT) in the medical literature to connote a similar level of seriousness that is attached to the term &quot;deep vein thrombosis.&quot; Although the phlebitis term is lacking here, the presence of symptoms of inflammation is understood as these larger veins uncommonly thrombose without associated symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins is relatively common, and may be much more common than previously believed. In the past, phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins were diagnosed on primarily clinical grounds. With the more frequent use of duplex ultrasound, venous thrombosis is more readily identified. Thrombosis of the great or small saphenous veins (ie, superficial vein thrombosis [SVT]) appears to be more prevalent than deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. SVT more commonly involves the great saphenous vein compared with the small saphenous vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Whether a diagnosis of SVT of the lower extremity increases the risk for thrombotic events other than DVT or pulmonary embolism is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In a cohort study from the Danish National Registry, the risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, and death were increased following a diagnosis SVT over a median seven years follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The highest risk was in the first three months following a diagnosis of SVT (AMI: hazard ratio [HR] 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.5; stroke: HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.8-3.8; death: HR 3.5, 95% CI 3.1-4.0).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins is associated with conditions that increase the risk of clotting, including those that lead to venous stasis, abnormalities of coagulation or fibrinolysis, and endothelial dysfunction. Venous stasis can be due to acute venous disease (eg, deep vein thrombosis, vein injury), chronic venous disease (eg, varicose veins, chronic venous insufficiency), venous procedures (eg, sclerotherapy, surgical ablation, venipuncture), immobilization (eg, postoperative, trauma), pregnancy, obesity, infection, intravenous therapy, or drug abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Risk factors for venous thrombosis are discussed in detail elsewhere. The most common factors associated with lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis are briefly discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Superficial vein thrombosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606696068\"><span class=\"h2\">Varicose veins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins is most likely to occur in varicose veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Varicose veins account for up to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Risk factors for superficial thrombophlebitis among those with varicose veins include trauma to the abnormal veins and lack of physical activity due to venous stasis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vein excision/ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombophlebitis of the superficial lower extremity veins can develop following open surgical, chemical, or endovenous ablation of incompetent veins. Following open vein excision, the residual end of an avulsed vein segment undergoes spasm and thrombosis. Thrombus may extend retrograde into an adjacent patent vein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-techniques-for-lower-extremity-vein-ablation#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical techniques for lower extremity vein ablation&quot;, section on 'Superficial thrombophlebitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liquid, foam, and glue sclerotherapy techniques for the treatment of lower extremity veins&quot;, section on 'Thrombus'</a>.)</p><p>Following endovenous ablation (ie, radiofrequency ablation, endovenous laser ablation), treatment of the vein segment leads to obliteration of the lumen by fibrosis, usually without significant thrombosis. For some patients, superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) can occur in the treated segment if the amount of energy delivered was not adequate, or potentially above the treated segment when there is stasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovenous-laser-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease#H715136924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovenous laser ablation for the treatment of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;, section on 'Postoperative duplex ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiofrequency-ablation-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;, section on 'Postoperative duplex ultrasound'</a>.) </p><p>Varying degrees of pain and inflammation occur depending upon the device used to effect closure. Radiofrequency ablation is associated with a lower incidence of clinically significant SVT compared with laser ablation; some device (energy delivered) laser wavelengths may cause less of a reaction. The technical aspects and complications of lower extremity venous ablation are discussed elsewhere.

The use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives and estrogen therapy also increase the risk for thrombophlebitis, SVT, and venous thromboembolism.

In the absence of varicose veins, phlebitis and thrombosis of the lower extremity superficial veins may be a marker for a hypercoagulable state or malignancy, for which the patient should be evaluated. </p><p>A history of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as well as current DVT increases the risk for SVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Conversely, a history of SVT increases the risk for future DVT. In a study using data from the multiple environmental and genetic assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis (MEGA) study, patients with a remote history of SVT had an increased risk of developing DVT (odds ratio [OR] 6.3, 95% CI 5.0-8.0) and pulmonary embolism (OR 3.9, 95% CI 3.0-5.1), but thrombophilia was only weakly associated with superficial thrombophlebitis, implicating stasis from varicose veins and obesity as more important factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

SVT associated with catheter use is due to a combination of endothelial injury and venous stasis. The upper extremity veins are affected far more commonly than lower extremity veins due to the frequency with which the upper extremity is used for access compared with the lower extremity.

Pulmonary embolism due to superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) alone is rare, and it is more likely there is a coexistent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The degree of inflammation (ie, phlebitis) varies depending on the length of the vein affected. In addition, there is often a palpable, sometimes nodular cord, due to thrombus within the affected vein. Persistence of this cord when the extremity is raised suggests the presence of thrombus. Low-grade fever may be present in uncomplicated superficial thrombophlebitis, but high fever should increase suspicion for suppurative superficial thrombophlebitis.

Most feel that duplex examination is essential for patients with suspected superficial vein thrombosis (SVT; ie, thrombus within the axial veins, either the great or small saphenous veins) due to the high rate of concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as well as to accurately make the diagnosis and define that anatomic extent of the thrombus so the patient can be reevaluated should they demonstrate clinical signs of propagation. (See <a href=\"#H75313480\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H75313669\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75312732\"><span class=\"h2\">Duplex ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplex ultrasound identifies the presence, location, and extent of vein thrombosis (superficial or deep vein thrombosis). Duplex can also help identify other pathology that may be a source of the patient's complaints (eg, popliteal cyst, muscle mass) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Duplex ultrasound is appropriate to confirm clinical findings for most patients presenting with symptoms consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis, though some patients with isolated findings remote from the great or small saphenous veins may be initially observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75313480\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A decision to obtain a duplex ultrasound depends upon the likelihood that the information obtained will change clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Under most circumstances, duplex is performed to evaluate for DVT. SVT can progress to involve the deep veins at any level in the lower extremity, though the risk of DVT progressing from the great saphenous (at the saphenofemoral junction) and small saphenous (at the saphenopopliteal junction) is greater than with the perforating veins.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with isolated uncomplicated phlebitis not affecting the great or small saphenous vein, and no other risk factors for DVT, the likelihood of venous thromboembolism is low and additional studies are generally not required. The patient should be treated symptomatically and undergo repeat clinical examination within 7 to 10 days to evaluate for resolution or progression. Resolution may take two to six weeks. Any worsening of clinical symptoms in spite of treatment or clinical progression of signs of phlebitis on physical examination should prompt evaluation with duplex ultrasound. Clinical progression includes worsened pain, increased swelling, or extension of a region of erythema or palpable cord. (See <a href=\"#H606699637\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic care'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Repeat duplex'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients may complain of pain along the known course of a superficial vein (eg, inner medial thigh) but have minimal physical findings (ie, no palpable cord or erythema) to support a clinical diagnosis of superficial thrombophlebitis or SVT. However, it is important to remember that the superficial veins in obese patients can be situated several centimeters below the surface of normal appearing skin. Although these patients likely have phlebitis and thrombosis of the superficial veins, they may have DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/11,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21-23</a>]. Duplex imaging is indicated in such cases to establish the diagnosis and to exclude the presence of DVT. It is important to note that even in a thin or normal-sized individual, SVT in the proximal great saphenous vein may not have the classic overlying erythema due to the depth of the vein in the proximal thigh. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinical symptoms that are clearly along the course of the great or small saphenous vein and indicative of SVT should undergo duplex examination to exclude extension into the deep venous system. Given their common risk factors, the association of superficial and deep venous thrombosis is not surprising. For patients with SVT in proximity (&le;5 cm) to the deep vein system, there is a high prevalence of concomitant proximal DVT. The risk of pulmonary embolism is also higher when SVT is present in the proximal great saphenous vein. Coexisting DVT is diagnosed with ultrasound in 6 to 53 percent of cases of SVT, with the highest risk occurring when the proximal great saphenous vein is involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/11,21-25,37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21-25,37-41</a>]. The physical findings can lag the proximal extent of thrombosis as detected by duplex scan. As an example, duplex scan may identify thrombus encroaching upon the saphenofemoral junction in a patient with an erythematous, hot tender cord confined to the course of the saphenous vein below the knee, and without symptoms in the thigh.

Direct extension of thrombus from the superficial to deep veins at confluences (eg, saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junctions) or via perforating veins can occur, and these regions should be evaluated at initial duplex examination, and at any follow-up examinations. When superficial and deep vein thrombosis exist as a contiguous finding on duplex ultrasound, it may be difficult to determine whether the superficial or deep venous system was affected first. Superficial vein thrombosis may represent a retrograde extension of thrombus from the deep veins to the superficial veins, which can occur in patients with venous valvular incompetence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/11,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21-23</a>].</p><p>Findings of perivenous fluid collections or air in the tissues indicated the presence of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Repeat duplex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data evaluating the cost effectiveness of serial duplex examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Depending upon physician and patient preference, we suggest subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> 2.5 mg daily, an intermediate subcutaneous dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dalteparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dalteparin</a> 5000 units every 12 hours, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> 40 mg daily), or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a> (10 mg daily), for a duration of 45 days. Briefer periods of anticoagulation appear to be too short to prevent recurrence in the long run [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A high rate of recurrent superficial phlebitis has been reported following early discontinuation of anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H75313669\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Most trials that have evaluated anticoagulation for SVT of the lower extremity have found a benefit, but these studies are small, with methodologic weaknesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/27,50,64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,50,64-67</a>]. Compared with placebo, NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, and LMWH have all been found to reduce thrombus extension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrence of phlebitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/27,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,68</a>]. A significant reduction in the incidence of pulmonary embolism for any of these agents has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/2,27,48,61,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27,48,61,69</a>]. The largest trial, the Comparison of ARIXTRA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>) in lower Limb Superficial Thrombophlebitis with placebo (CALISTO) trial, randomly assigned 3002 patients to receive fondaparinux (2.5 mg subcutaneous daily for 45 days) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Patients had duplex-confirmed thrombophlebitis over an at least 5-cm segment of vein. Patients with anatomic or medical risk factors for thromboembolism (eg, involvement of the great saphenous vein within 3 cm of the saphenofemoral junction, recent surgery, prior phlebitis or deep vein thrombosis, cancer) were excluded. Interval duplex examination was performed at the discretion of the physician. Similar to other trials, significant reductions were seen in the treatment group compared with placebo for the incidence of thrombus extension (0.3 versus 3.4 percent), recurrence of phlebitis (0.3 versus 1.6 percent), and deep vein thrombosis (0.2 versus 1.2 percent). The incidence of pulmonary embolus was also reduced in the treatment group compared with placebo (0 versus 0.3 percent); however, the absolute risk reduction was minimal at -0.3 (95% CI 0.6-0.0). </p><p>In this trial, it is important to note that most of these patients were <strong>low</strong> risk (anatomic or medical criteria) for DVT, and less than 5 percent of patients developed thrombus extension or deep vein thrombosis. In a post hoc analysis, the outcomes of 109 patients with symptomatic thrombus extension among the 1500 patients in the placebo arm were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The risk of subsequent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was similar whether the extension occurred to &le;3 cm or &gt;3 cm from the saphenofemoral junction (9.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">[5/54]</span> versus 8.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">[5/56]</span> percent, respectively). In those with extension &le;3 cm, DVT occurred in four patients and pulmonary embolism in one, and in those with extension &gt;3 cm, deep vein thrombosis occurred in three patients (proximal in one and distal in two) and pulmonary embolism in two patients. A cost model derived from the CALISTO trial data and other studies found that treatment of isolated phlebitis and thrombosis of the superficial veins with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> for 45 days was not cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. </p><p>In addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> and a variety of low-molecular-weight heparins in various dosing regimens and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a> have been evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/2,27,64,69,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27,64,69,72</a>].

Higher-dose unfractionated heparin (10,000 to 12,500 units twice daily) compared with the lower doses (5000 units twice daily) has a significantly lower incidence of saphenous thrombus extension (3.3 versus 20.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/66,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,73</a>]. The reported incidence of bleeding complications with LMWH or subcutaneous heparin has been low, likely due to the fact that patients with an increased risk for bleeding (eg, previous peptic ulcer, poorly controlled hypertension, renal insufficiency) have generally been excluded from study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50</a>]. </p><p>Direct factor Xa inhibitors have been used for the prevention and treatment of DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/72,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,74</a>] and may offer a less burdensome and less expensive oral treatment option for SVT as well.

No differences were found for the primary efficacy outcome at 45 or 90 days (composite of symptomatic DVT or pulmonary embolism, progression or recurrence of superficial vein-thrombosis, and all-cause mortality; hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% CI 0.6-6.4; p = 0.0025 for noninferiority at 45 days; HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5&ndash;2.2; p = 0.0047 for noninferiority at 90 days), or for the individual endpoints. There were no major bleeds in either group, but more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in the rivaroxaban group (3 versus &lt;1 percent). High risk was defined as age &gt;65, male sex, previous thromboembolism, or prior superficial vein thrombosis, cancer, autoimmune disease, or involvement of nonvaricose veins.
