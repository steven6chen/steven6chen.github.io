An important goal of all physicians who care for patients with severe renal dysfunction should be to preserve and protect the central veins, a task that is not easily accomplished. The development of this problem in the dialysis patient is a serious issue, and it has a greater impact compared with stenosis of a peripheral vein because the central veins represent the final common pathway for blood flow from the periphery to the heart. If central stenosis is allowed to progress, the arteriovenous hemodialysis vascular access may eventually be lost. In addition, the development of central vein obstruction obviates the possibility of creating a new vascular access on the affected side. An unfortunate consequence of the loss of central vein patency for the patient is diminished life expectancy. </p><p>Central vein stenosis associated specifically with hemodialysis access is reviewed here. General issues related to catheter-induced upper extremity venous thrombosis are reviewed separately. Thrombosis observed in patients with hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis arteriovenous graft dysfunction and failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the precise mechanisms by which central vein stenosis (CVS) occurs are not known, current concepts in its pathophysiology follow the response to vessel injury model, emphasizing the process of trauma, inflammation, intimal hyperplasia, and a fibrotic response. It is very likely that the exact mechanism can vary depending on the situation and may be multifactorial in many cases. Regardless of the inciting cause, the end result is the same. There is an upregulation of proinflammatory transcription factors and profibrotic genes, which in turn causes smooth muscle proliferation and thickening of the venous intima. The resulting venous outflow obstruction causes venous hypertension and threatens fistula and arm function. Certain inferences can be drawn from factors that are associated with the pathophysiology of central vein stenosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vein injury &ndash; Central vein stenosis in the dialysis patient is most commonly associated with the presence of an intraluminal foreign body, either a central venous catheter (CVC) or the leads associated with a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED). These lie in direct contact with the wall of the central veins, and the constant movement of these associated with the dual processes of breathing and the cardiac cycle causes endothelial injury. Pathological examinations of central veins obtained at autopsy have shown that even short-term catheters are associated with foci of local intimal injury with endothelial denudation and adherent thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This injury appears to be aggravated if the route followed by the device is characterized by one or more curves, accounting for a higher incidence of central vein stenosis with subclavian or left internal jugular vein placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation &ndash; Data suggest that inflammation plays a role in CVS. The pathology associated with this lesion is characterized by neointimal hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is a common response to vessel injury and is closely related to vessel injury and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. There is also an increased incidence of central vein stenosis in patients having had catheter-related infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Although not shown to be directly related to CVS, the mere presence of a CVC in the absence of infection has been shown to be associated with an increased level of systemic inflammation as indicated by increases in inflammatory markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamics &ndash; Abnormal hemodynamics and turbulent blood flow very likely play at least a contributing role in the development of CVS. This has been shown to be a major contributor to the development of venous stenosis in peripheral veins of patients with an arteriovenous dialysis access. It has been suggested that the same mechanism is at play in the central veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A significant number of CVS cases are seen in which there is no antecedent history of a central venous intraluminal device having been placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Turbulent blood flow has been offered as an explanation for the development of the lesion in these cases. Indirect evidence supporting the ideological role of hemodynamics is derived from studies that have shown flow reduction to be effective in stabilizing recurrent symptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uremia &ndash; It has been suggested that the uremic state itself may predispose to the development of the neointimal hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Turbulent blood flow associated with the creation of an arteriovenous dialysis access is a major stimulant to the development of neointimal hyperplasia. However, early stages of the lesion have been shown to be present in the peripheral veins of chronic renal disease patients prior to the creation of a peripheral access. Although studies of central veins in these patients have not been reported, the endothelial dysfunction associated with uremia is systemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H705459948\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of central vein stenosis (CVS) in the dialysis population is not known. The lesion is detected either as an incidental finding when a venogram is performed or because the patient has typical signs or symptoms. If neither of these occurs, the lesion generally goes undetected. Another issue affecting reported incidence rates is the denominator that is used to calculate the percentage of occurrence (eg, is it based upon total dialysis patients examined or upon the number of patients having had prior catheters?). Several factors exert a major influence on the incidence of this pathology, including the frequency with which the population in question is exposed to central venous catheters or to transvenous leads of a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) and the specific vein into which these devices have been inserted. It is not surprising that the reported incidence represents a broad range of 3 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8,13,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,18-22</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 47 patients with a dysfunctional arteriovenous fistula were evaluated with an upper extremity venogram. Of these cases, 24 had a history of a central venous catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. CVS was observed in 12 cases. Only six of these were symptomatic with swelling of their access arm. All 12 patients had a history of an ipsilateral CVC. The 50 percent incidence observed would have been reduced to 12.8 percent had the evaluation been based upon the presence of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 133 patients in a dialysis cohort of 235 cases had venography to evaluate arteriovenous hemodialysis access dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of this group, 100 patients had a peripheral vein stenosis and 55 (41 percent) had central vein stenosis. Both lesions were present in 42 cases. Only 11 of these patients had symptoms of arm edema that would have suggested the presence of central vein stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 69 consecutive patients undergoing placement of right internal jugular vein tunneled catheters, 30 percent (14 of 46 cases) of whom had not had previous catheters, showed evidence of stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angulation of the central veins that was sufficiently severe to alter or abandon the catheter insertion procedure []. This same approximate incidence in asymptomatic patients was also confirmed in a later study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H204765299\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central venous catheters (CVCs) are the most common cause of central vein stenosis (CVS). However, other devices, such as cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) leads and upper extremity peripherally inserted central lines (PICCs), may also be frequent causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H204765325\"><span class=\"h2\">Central venous catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency with which these devices cause CVS varies according to the vein used for catheter introduction, the type of catheter that is used, the duration of catheter use, and the number of catheters that are placed. In a study of 30 patients, the prevalence of CVS among patients with history of 0 to 1, 2 to 3, and &ge;4 central venous catheters was 3.4, 29, and 54 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The incidence of subclavian vein stenosis is higher with temporary hemodialysis catheters compared with tunneled catheters, which is not surprising since these catheters are relatively stiffer and result in a greater degree of mechanical injury to the vein. Although central vein stenosis is most commonly related to prior central catheters, transvenous leads associated with CIEDs can also be problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/25-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-33</a>]. </p><p>Although even a short-term catheter can result in central vein stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], there appears to be a definite relationship between the duration of catheter use, numbers of prior catheters, and the development of venous stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. In one study, a statistically significant relationship was shown between CVS and increasing cumulative days with an indwelling catheter (210 versus 120 [odds ratio] OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.70&ndash;7.2) and a history of multiple catheter insertions (2.46 versus 1.35 catheters) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>It should also be kept in mind that although central catheter use is the major cause of this problem, not all patients with these catheters develop CVS. In one study in which 111 patients were evaluated with a venogram, 76 percent of patients who had no evidence of a central vein problem had a prior central catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81925159\"><span class=\"h3\">Insertion site and lesion location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although no placement site is exempt, the incidence of CVS varies depending upon the vein used for placement. The right internal jugular vein is associated with the lowest incidence. This has been attributed to the fact that a catheter inserted at this site follows a straight course to the right atrium, which may minimize endothelial injury. In one study, 50 patients with a right internal jugular catheter were compared with 50 who had a subclavian catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Venography revealed more stenoses in the subclavian group (42 percent) compared with the internal jugular group (10 percent).</p><p>CVS can occur anywhere within the central veins. In one study in which 55 hemodialysis patients with CVS were evaluated with venography, the most common location for a lesion involved the subclavian-cephalic arch junction (38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This was followed by the brachiocephalic veins (29 percent), the subclavian vein only (24 percent), and the superior vena cava (9 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55688303\"><span class=\"h4\">Peripheral insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although subclavian and internal jugular cannulation sites are more commonly blamed for central vein stenosis, peripheral insertion sites for central venous catheters are associated with a high incidence of venous stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are not recommended for patients at risk for or with known mid-stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), stage 4 and 5 CKD, or end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Rather, a small-bore central catheter in the internal jugular vessels should be used instead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Such catheters can last longer than PICC lines, can be easily replaced, and have fewer complications during the period of use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3103752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Central catheters and devices'</a>.)</p><p>In a study in which venography was performed before and after insertion of PICCs in 150 patients, 7.5 percent of patients with previously normal central veins developed angiographic abnormalities after PICC placement (central veins stenosis in 4.8 percent, central venous occlusion in 2.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nontunneled catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To minimize the risk of developing CVS, the use of a short-term temporary catheter is frequently advocated; however, even this approach can lead to problems. The propensity for these catheters to cause central vein stenosis, as well as the marked increase in the incidence of catheter-related infection, limits the duration of their use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H79683463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Duration of use'</a>.)</p><p>In a prospective study, 57 patients with nontunneled dialysis catheters were studied with venography at the time of catheter removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Although the mean dwell time for the catheters was only 21 days, eight patients (14 percent) had central vein stenosis; in two, the stenosis was &gt;50 percent luminal narrowing. There were no differences with respect to rates of stenosis between those with right internal jugular vein and right subclavian vein catheters. It should be noted, however, that this little relationship has not been consistent. In another study, exposure to a nontunneled catheter was not associated with an increased risk of CVS; 55 percent of patients with a nontunneled catheter had CVS compared with 45 percent who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The duration of catheter use was 210 days for the total group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81924511\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac implantable electronic devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic kidney disease have a high incidence of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In the United States Renal Data System database, more than 25 percent of cardiac deaths are attributable to arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. As a result of these problems, there is a frequent need for the placement of a CIED such as a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or cardiac resynchronization device. Because transvenous placement of the electrical leads associated with these devices is the most common method of insertion, this has given rise to the second most common cause of CVS. Unlike a CVC, the CIED is long-term and cannot be removed to ameliorate the problem.</p><p>Studies of non-ESRD patients have demonstrated the development of central vein stenosis among patients with CIEDs. In a group of 229 patients, 64 percent developed central vein stenosis six months after placement of a transvenous pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another study, venography was performed in 100 patients with a CIED who were candidates for a generator change, lead revision, or device upgrade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Transvenous leads had been in place for an average of eight years. The incidence of venous obstruction in these cases was 26 percent, with 9 percent having total obstruction and 17 percent exhibiting partial obstruction defined as &gt;70 percent. In a similar study, bilateral venography was performed in 105 patients who were candidates for generator replacement after having had their first CIED for an average of 47 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Venous obstruction of various degrees was found in 25 percent of the patients. Complete occlusion was found in 9 percent, severe stenosis (&gt;75 percent diameter reduction) in 6 percent, and moderate stenosis (50 to 75 percent diameter reduction) in 10 percent of the patients. </p><p>While this complication is generally asymptomatic in most patients, this is not the case in the dialysis patient. In this population, CIED transvenous lead-associated CVS can be a major problem. Additionally, because of the abnormal hemodynamics associated with increased blood flow through the central veins, the incidence of CVS appears to be higher. In one retrospective study, 495 patients had CIEDs with transvenous leads over a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In this group, 20 dialysis patients were identified, and 14 had an arteriovenous access in the arm ipsilateral to the device. Ten of these (70 percent) developed symptoms of CVS. All 10 symptomatic patients required ligation of their access to control symptoms. In another retrospective study of 590 hemodialysis patients, 43 were found to have a CIED with transvenous leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Of these cases, 34 (79 percent) underwent venography, 21 had CVS, and significantly more had CVS compared with those without a CIED (62 versus 32 percent). Ten of the 21 patients with CIED-associated CVS became catheter dependent for dialysis after device insertion.</p><p>CIED transvenous lead-associated CVS can have a disastrous effect on the hemodialysis patient. The loss of an access ipsilateral to this complication generally means a loss of the extremity of future access creation. This, along with the potential complications of worsening of tricuspid insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] and spreading infection from an infected dialysis access to the transvenous leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>], has prompted the suggestion that transvenous leads be avoided in these patients in favor of epicardial leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>In the past, the transvenous placement of CIED leads became the treatment of choice because of the morbidity and mortality associated with surgical lead implantation. However, new minimally invasive surgical techniques have been introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. </p><p>In a study involving patients who were eligible for cardiac resynchronization therapy, epicardial lead placement (n = 9) was compared with transvenous lead placement (n = 12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The primary endpoint was a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume index at six months. The secondary endpoints included 30-day mortality rate, measures of clinical improvement, one-year electrical lead performance, and one-year survival rate. The relative improvement of left ventricular end-systolic volume index from baseline to six months was similar between the arms (28.8 percent for the transvenous versus 30.5 percent for the epicardial arm). There were no significant differences in the secondary endpoints between the two groups. </p><p>Another study was conducted to compare the value of epicardial (EPI group) versus transvenous (ENDO group) CIED lead placement in patients in whom transvenous leads had been removed because of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. A comparable cohort of 80 cases was included in each group. Patients were followed for a period of 12 months. All CIEDs were successfully implanted. In the EPI group, two patients developed significant pericardial bleeding. Mortality was 0 percent in the ENDO group and 2.5 percent in the EPI group. At one year, there were no infection recurrences in either group and mortality was equal. </p><p>Even though the placement of epicardial leads requires a surgical procedure and can be associated with a degree of increased morbidity, they are particularly attractive for the dialysis patient because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with the loss of dialysis access that can be associated with transvenous leads in these patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H204766105\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter-related infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A relationship between CVS and catheter-related infection has also been reported. It should be noted that accurate evaluation of the relationship between catheter-associated infection and CVS is difficult because of multiple confounding variables. Although there is inflammation associated with a catheter infection and the infection can spread to involve the vessel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], a CVC is removed immediately upon the recognition of the infection. This contributes to the CVC either being in place for a shorter period of time (tendency to decrease the incidence) or being inserted multiple times (tendency to increase the incidence). </p><p>In one report involving nontunneled catheters, the incidence of infection among those who developed CVS was two times that of cases that did not (8 of 10 versus 10 of 30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another report from the same group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], CVS was three times more common among patients with previous catheter-related infection (75 versus 28 percent). However, this relationship has not been consistently reported. In a retrospective evaluation of 500 consecutive patients who had a central line, the incidence of culture-proven bacteremia in the total group was 39.4 percent and 23.6 percent for symptomatic CVS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Both infection and CVS developed in 12.6 percent. Cases with infections occurring within 90 days of CVC placement were significantly less likely to develop CVS compared with those who developed infection later (5.9 versus 22.8 percent). However, no significant difference in the overall bacteremia rate per 1000 catheter-days was reported between patients with and without CVS (2.62 versus 2.35). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234101779\"><span class=\"h2\">External compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all central vein problems are due to intraluminal pathology. There are situations in which the problem is related to external compression from adjacent structures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234101771\"><span class=\"h3\">Ectatic aortic arch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most frequent instances of external compression occurs when there is ectasia of the aortic arch or its branches. When this occurs, a deformity of the left brachiocephalic vein may be seen on imaging. The deformity is characteristic in its location and overall shape. The edges are more abrupt and straighter, rather than tapering in a manner that is associated with an intraluminal lesion. That this deformity can cause a true obstruction can be confirmed by the presence of collateral veins peripheral to the deformity. It is important that this situation is recognized for what it is; attempts to dilate the vein with an angioplasty balloon will have no effect. Some have suggested stenting in cases with significant symptoms; however, placement may be difficult owing to the large size of the vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H204766781\" class=\"local\">'Stenting'</a> below.)</p><p>In one study, 48 cases were reviewed retrospectively looking for extrinsic compression of the left brachiocephalic vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Presence of collaterals was noted as well as the presence of any intrinsic stenosis of the left brachiocephalic or subclavian veins. Some degree of extrinsic compression was observed in 21 patients (44 percent). Twelve (25 percent) had mild compression, six (13 percent) had moderate compression, and three (6 percent) had severe compression. Collateral veins were seen in 11 of 21. All three patients with severe extrinsic compression were symptomatic and were treated with stent placement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234101757\"><span class=\"h3\">Costoclavicular junction compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant number of central vein stenotic lesions occur at the junction of the first rib and the clavicle, the costoclavicular junction. It is felt that some, if not many, of these are related at least in part to external compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. This situation is very similar to that which exists in thoracic outlet syndrome. The subclavian vein is vulnerable as it passes next to the intersection of the clavicle and first rib. Excessive bulk of the anterior scalene muscle (which lies behind the subclavian vein), the subclavius muscle underlying the clavicle, and the costoclavicular ligament may all further reduce the costoclavicular space in the anterior portion of the thoracic outlet. Management of this problem will be discussed under surgical management below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis#H351070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary (spontaneous) upper extremity deep vein thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis'</a> and <a href=\"#H1234105312\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234101750\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many central vein stenosis (CVS) lesions in the hemodialysis patient are asymptomatic, the clinical picture of the symptomatic lesion is quite typical and diagnostic if the lesion is ipsilateral to the arteriovenous access. The symptomatic patient characteristically develops ipsilateral arm edema, which is often progressive and can become severe. Frequently, swelling of the ipsilateral shoulder, breast, neck, and face develops as the arm edema progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/26,28,30,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,30,59</a>]. </p><p>Severe extremity edema can cause considerable patient discomfort and increase the patient's risk for serious complications, such as skin ulceration and infection. Dialysis therapy becomes increasingly difficult due to problems with cannulation. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is an uncommon complication of either SVC stenosis or obstruction or bilateral brachiocephalic vein narrowing or occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/40,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,60</a>]. This clinical syndrome comprises edema of both upper extremities, face, and neck, along with multiple dilated collateral veins over the chest and neck. The syndrome can appear acutely, making emergent treatment necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In addition, features not generally associated with central vein occlusion can occur in special situations. Pleural effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>], subarachnoid hemorrhage with myoclonic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], unilateral high-pressure glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], unilateral conduction hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], cerebral infarct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>], and bleeding esophageal varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] have all been reported. These unusual conditions are the result of increased venous pressure, venous engorgement, and the development of collateral venous drainage around the central venous lesion. Their occurrence in a patient with severe central vein stenosis or occlusion associated with a marked increase in venous pressure peripheral to the stenosis should arouse suspicion that the dialysis access may be involved. </p><p>Often, especially in thin-chested individuals with a subclavian lesion, a localized thrill can be felt over the anterior chest just below the clavicle, and a localized bruit is frequently evident at that spot. Additionally, subcutaneous collateral veins over the arm and chest are frequently evident. Physical examination of a patient with a cephalic arch lesion and a subclavian lesion may be indistinguishable except for arm swelling. If that is present, stenosis of the subclavian or a vein that lies more centrally should be suspected. As with any venous obstruction, when the central veins develop stenosis, collaterals begin to develop. Depending somewhat upon the site of the lesion, these may connect to the veins of the chest wall and through the intercostal veins to the azygos system, or they may drain through the jugular veins or the middle thyroid vein to bypass the blockage. With obstruction of the superior vena cava, the azygos vein can become enlarged enough to be visible on chest radiograph. With the development of collaterals, it is possible for the obstruction to be decompressed. In this instance, the symptoms abate, and if flow is adequate, the access can continue to function adequately. These patients typically have numerous large venous collaterals over their neck, chest, and possibly on the abdomen.</p><p>The arteriovenous dialysis access can be markedly affected in the patient with significant CVS. Unlike stenosis in a peripheral vein, which causes significant hyperpulsatility in the access, CVS generally causes only minimal or no increase in intensity of the pulse. The greater distance, along with the elastic compliant nature of the veins, serves to dampen the pulse. Fluid accumulation in the subcutaneous tissue makes it more difficult to palpate the access and increases the skin-to-access distance, which in some cases can exceed the length of the dialysis needle. With increasing degrees of edema of the extremity, cannulation of the access becomes increasingly difficult. With increasing resistance as the severity of the lesion progresses, intra-access pressure rises, resulting in dilatation of the vein. In the patient with an arteriovenous fistula, the increase in size can reach aneurysmal proportions, resulting in what has been referred to as a megafistula. Access blood flow decreases with increasing downstream resistance. This affects the efficiency of dialysis, and, as it progresses, it can eventually lead to access thrombosis. In most instances, a thrombosed arteriovenous access does not contain a large volume of clot and the thrombus is limited to the access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. However, markedly dilated veins associated with a CVS can result in a very large clot volume that can extend up to the site of the lesion. Thrombectomy is difficult in these cases, and there are anecdotal reports of fatal pulmonary embolism associated with thrombectomy attempts.</p><p>The mechanism for this symptom complex is venous hypertension, which results from the markedly increased pressure and blood flow generated by the arteriovenous access. It is unusual for arm edema to occur with even a total obstruction of a peripheral vein (defined as a vein outside of the bony thorax). This is due to the fact that these lesions do not result in a total obstruction to venous outflow from the extremity; there are other veins to which flow can be diverted, avoiding the development of venous hypertension. It is not until the dialysis outflow reaches the central veins that it is channeled into a single common pathway. When the central veins are obstructed, the increased resistance to flow affects all of the venous structures in the extremity. This global increase in venous pressure causes the exudation of fluid into the tissue. Occasionally, in a patient with both a central and peripheral lesion, the peripheral stenosis appears to prevent the markedly increased central venous pressure that would otherwise result from the central location. In this setting, symptoms may appear only after the peripheral lesion has been treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H204766401\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not all central vein stenoses (CVSs) are hemodynamically significant, significant lesions can usually be diagnosed by physical examination. Central venous obstruction should be suspected in any dialysis patient who presents with any of the symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs discussed above. The presence of massive arm edema in the access arm is virtually pathognomonic of central vein stenosis. However, venography is required for diagnosis and localization of the lesion, which may be observed in the subclavian veins, brachiocephalic veins, and even the superior vena cava. At the first sign of extremity edema ipsilateral to an arteriovenous access, the patient should be referred for angiographic evaluation. Delay can result in the lesion progressing to the point that it becomes untreatable, resulting in the loss of the access and rendering the extremity unusable for future access placement. </p><p>The question arises as to making the diagnosis of CVS in the absence of an ipsilateral arteriovenous access. Duplex ultrasound has been used extensively to evaluate venous anatomy. The main disadvantage is its inability to image the central veins. However, right and left subclavian and internal jugular venous spectral Doppler waveforms can be analyzed for indirect evidence of stenosis or occlusion in the nonvisualized central portion of the subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein, and superior vena cava. This can be inferred by detecting typical patterns of diminished respiratory phasicity and diminished transmitted cardiac pulsatility in the subclavian and jugular veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. </p><p>Venography is considered the gold standard for evaluating venous anatomy and is widely used but is an invasive procedure. Computed tomography (CT) venography also has been recommended for use in selected cases where establishing a diagnosis is critical. In a study of 40 patients, the sensitivities and a specificities of CT venography for the detection of subclavian and superior vena cava stenosis were 88.2 and 97.5 percent, and 88.8 and 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance angiography and even three-dimensional magnetic resonance studies have been used to evaluate the central veins of dialysis patients suspected of having problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. However, the administration of gadolinium during magnetic resonance imaging has been strongly linked to an often severe disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with moderate-to-severe renal disease, particularly those requiring dialysis. As a result, it is recommended that gadolinium-based imaging be avoided in dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key indication for treatment of central vein stenosis (CVS) is the presence of pathophysiology, not abnormal anatomy. To qualify for endovascular intervention, a venous stenosis with a &gt;50 percent decrease in the luminal diameter must be associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">clinical/physiological</span> abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Several treatment options are available depending upon the location and nature of the lesion. </p><p>There are no trials comparing endovascular intervention with surgery, and wide variability has been reported for outcomes of endovascular intervention. Critical review of these reports reveals that this is most likely the result of inconsistent inclusion criteria, such as location, length, and severity of the venous obstruction. Additionally, very little attention has been paid to differences in the morphology or etiology of the lesions treated. Nevertheless, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stent placement for angioplasty failure has been adopted as the standard for treatment of CVS. This approach is preferred because of its minimally invasive nature compared with surgery for these lesions. (See <a href=\"#H55692217\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1234105312\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55690909\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications to intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic treatment of a stenosis that fulfills the anatomic criteria (&gt;50 percent diameter reduction) but is <strong>not</strong> associated with a hemodynamic, functional, or clinical abnormality is not warranted and should <strong>not</strong> be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/75-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-78</a>]. This is especially important for central venous lesions. Asymptomatic CVS, even if greater than 50 percent, does not require treatment and is better managed by simple observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The success of a conservative approach to asymptomatic lesions was demonstrated in a retrospective study of 86 lesions in 35 patients in which the natural history of high-grade (&gt;50 percent) asymptomatic central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients and the outcome of treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were documented. Differences in rate of lesion progression between treated and untreated patients were tabulated. Twenty-eight percent of lesions (24 of 86) were not treated, while the remainder (62 of 86) were treated with angioplasty. No untreated lesion progressed to symptoms, stent placement, or additional stenosis. Eight percent (six cases) of treated cases were followed by stenosis or symptom escalation; one patient developed arm swelling, four required stents, and four developed additional stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55692217\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55689922\"><span class=\"h2\">Angioplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies evaluating angioplasty for the treatment of central vein stenosis (CVS) are small and retrospective, with reported technical success rates ranging from 70 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/15,20,80-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20,80-86</a>]. The primary and cumulative patency rates for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) treatment of CVS vary widely. Reported six-month primary patency rates are 23 to 63 percent, and six&ndash;month cumulative patency rates range between 29 and 100 percent. The reported 12-month primary patency rates range from 12 to 50 percent with cumulative patency rates between 13 and 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/15,20,80-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20,80-86</a>].</p><p>A major problem with lesions in the central veins is that many are elastic. It has been postulated that there are actually two types of lesions based upon their response to angioplasty, elastic and inelastic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In one series, <span class=\"nowrap\">21/28</span> (70 percent) showed &ge;50 percent improvement in the luminal diameter and <span class=\"nowrap\">7/21</span> (23 percent) showed no improvement due to elasticity of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Subsequently, 81 percent of the successful PTAs restenosed at an average of 7.6 months while 100 percent of elastic lesions occluded in an average of 2.9 months. The authors proposed stenting for the elastic lesions. (See <a href=\"#H81926204\" class=\"local\">'Stenting for failed angioplasty'</a> below.)</p><p>In summary, technical failures will occur in 10 to 30 percent of patients treated with PTA for CVS. There are patients with CVS who have elastic lesions that will be unresponsive to PTA. It is also apparent that multiple repeated interventions with close surveillance are required with PTA to maintain patency and prevent occlusion over the long term. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H204766781\"><span class=\"h2\">Stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stents have evolved through three generations (stainless steel stents, nitinol stents, and stent grafts), and although the reported data for each have shown considerable overlap in patency rates, there is a general impression on the part of many interventionalists that results have progressively improved with each new generation. However, reports in which stainless steel and nitinol stents have been compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/87-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-90</a>] have failed to detect a difference. </p><p>Bare metal stents have come to be referred to as simply stents.

It should be noted that in most instances, these stenting procedures should be classified as salvage procedures, assuming that the cases were done for the recommended indications. That being the case, comparison with PTA results is not really appropriate. The comparison would have to be with similar PTA failure cases that were not stented. No such comparisons have been reported. Primary stenting is discussed below.

Unfortunately, these results have not been replicated by others. More typical results for the use of stainless steel stents for treating central venous stenosis are exemplified in a study of 20 cases (also using Wallstent) in which primary patency rates at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 90, 67, 42, and 25 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Very few studies, however, have focused upon CVS. In one study, 18 patients with CVS and 12 with central vein occlusion were treated with a stent graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].

Primary assisted patency rates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 100, 100, 80, and 75 percent, respectively. Patients who had not undergone a previous procedure had a significantly shorter time to repeat intervention compared with those who had undergone PTA or stent placement previously. Patients with central venous occlusive lesions had a significantly shorter primary patency interval compared with those with stenoses.

Based upon observational data that stenting does not improve long-term central vein patency and likely necessitates more reinterventions, we suggest that stenting should not be used as the primary intervention; rather, it should be reserved for cases of PTA-resistant lesions and recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H81926204\" class=\"local\">'Stenting for failed angioplasty'</a> above.).</p><p>A possible exception to this recommendation is a procedure referred to as recanalization (also sharp-needle recanalization). In this procedure, a CVS that is a total obstruction is crossed by penetration with a sharp device. In this instance, there is no true vessel wall. A stent is placed to reconstitute the vascular lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. There are only anecdotal reports of these cases in the literature.</p><p>There is considerable overlap when comparing patency rates of primary angioplasty versus primary stent placement for treating central venous stenosis, suggesting no advantage. In addition, secondary interventions appear to be the rule even for stenting, and assisted primary patency rates are generally comparable.

The alternative of surgery may not be a good choice for one of several reasons. Banding of the access to reproduce blood flow and pressure has been shown to be effective in eliminating or at least markedly reducing the patient's symptoms. Balloon-assisted banding has been used for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>This is a combined endovascular-surgical procedure in which a 4-mm (sizes ranging from 3 to 5 mm have been used) angioplasty balloon is used as a mandrel for sizing the lumen created by the banding, which is done through a surgical incision made adjacent to the perianastomotic portion of the dialysis access. The goal of the procedure is to produce a controlled decrease in blood flow and pressure. The primary risk of the procedure is thrombosis of the access due to the reduced level of blood flow produced. As one would expect, the risk is greater in cases in which the initial blood flow is in a lower range (less than 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span>.</p><p>In one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], 22 patients with uncontrollable symptoms related to central vein stenosis were treated with this technique. The mean blood flow in this group of cases was 1640 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> (range 870 to 4200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span>. The mean blood flow following banding was 820 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> (412 to 2050 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span>. Symptoms resolved in 20 cases and were markedly improved in the other two. Two of the arteriovenous fistulas failed, one at eight months postprocedure and the other at 13 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126365015\"><span class=\"h2\">AV fistulas versus AV grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective study was performed to determine if there was a difference between arteriovenous (AV) fistulas and synthetic grafts in the results that could be obtained with therapy for central venous stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. This study showed that the intervention-free survival for CVS was longer in patients with autogenous fistulas compared with grafts and in patients who did not previously undergo hemodialysis catheter insertion. The study cohort consisted of 38 patients (22 with fistulas and 16 with grafts). Eighty-nine interventions were performed; 83 were angioplasties and six were stent placements. Previous catheter placement on the side of the CVS occurred in 29 of the 38 patients (76 percent). Technical and clinical success of the interventions was 93.3 and 94.4 percent respectively. The intervention or primary patency rates&plusmn;standard errors at three, six, and nine months in the fistula group were 88.5 percent&plusmn;4.8, 59.4 percent&plusmn;7.6, and 46 percent&plusmn;7.9, respectively. In the graft group, the rates were 78.1 percent&plusmn;7.3, 40.7 percent&plusmn;9, and 16 percent&plusmn;7.3, respectively. With multivariate analysis, intervention patency remained significantly longer for fistulas (p = 0.014) and in patients who did not have a previous catheter (p = 0.001). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234105312\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is not usually needed; however, in selected cases surgery can play an important role in the treatment of central venous stenosis (CVS) associated with hemodialysis access. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous bypass<strong><em> &ndash; </em></strong>When the CVS is actually a total occlusion that cannot be crossed with a guidewire, the patient is faced with the problem of intractable venous hypertension with its attendant symptoms or loss of the access unless the access can be decompressed via a surgical bypass. This is a good option because it obviates the symptoms of venous hypertension while preserving dialysis access. There are several types of bypass that can be done. If the obstruction is within the subclavian vein, the simplest approach is to create a cephalic vein or axillary vein to internal jugular vein bypass of the obstructed subclavian segment via a polytetrafluoroethylene bridge graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/41,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,107</a>]. With an obstruction more centrally, within the brachiocephalic, this ipsilateral option is not available. However, in these cases it may be possible for the surgeon to create a bypass to the contralateral jugular system. In selected cases, a bypass to the right atrial appendage has been created to successfully salvage the vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>]. In order to justify this major surgery, the patient should have severe symptoms of central venous obstruction with access malfunction and an absence of alternative access sites. In one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>], 11 patients with complete central vein occlusion aged 20 to 70 (mean 46) years underwent atrial appendage to maintain arteriovenous access in patients. All were cases with no other upper extremity access options. Three bypasses were performed with autogenous vein, and eight were performed with polytetrafluoroethylene. There was one early mortality due to sepsis, and early morbidity was limited to one patient with a symptomatic pericardial effusion. Mean follow-up was 16 (range 3 to 43) months. Sixty-seven and 33 percent of arteriovenous fistulas remained functional at 6 and 10 months, respectively, and one patient's fistula remained functional at 21 months. Four patients (36 percent) developed central bypass stenosis or occlusion, one requiring a redo bypass and three requiring angioplasty. Infection occurred in two patients (18 percent), with removal of autogenous vein graft in one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Costoclavicular decompression<strong><em> &ndash; </em></strong>As with the treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome, costoclavicular compression has been treated with decompression. This surgery involves the resection of either the first rib or clavicular resection and thorough external venolysis to assure that the adjacent muscle and other tissues are not affecting the vein. As with bypass surgery, this approach to management should be reserved for those cases in which symptoms are severe, and there has been significant resistance to other forms of therapy with limited availability of access sites. In one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], 10 patients were treated with costoclavicular decompression. All had severe arm symptoms of venous hypertension in the involved extremity: four had dialysis access dysfunction, two had severe arm pain, and one had a pseudoaneurysm. All patients had subclavian vein stenosis at the costoclavicular junction by angiography or intravascular ultrasound. The majority of patients had balloon dilation (mean 2.3 attempts) without success. Six patients underwent transaxillary first rib resection and four had medial claviculectomy. In all, 80 percent of fistulas remained functionally patent, and all but one patient (who underwent ligation) had complete relief of upper arm edema. Median hospital length of stay was two days, and mean follow-up was seven months (range 1 to 13). There was no mortality or significant morbidity. Five patients later required central venous angioplasty (four subclavian and one brachiocephalic), and three had stents placed (two subclavian, one brachiocephalic). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thoracic-outlet-syndromes#H293625095\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thoracic outlet syndromes&quot;, section on 'Thoracic outlet decompression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H204767011\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FAILURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of central vein stenosis (CVS) treatment is twofold: control of symptoms of venous obstruction and preservation of a vascular access capable of providing adequate dialysis. Unfortunately, there are cases in which these twin goals cannot be achieved. In these cases, occlusion of the access becomes necessary. This will result in a rapid resolution of the symptoms of venous hypertension but creates the necessity for a new vascular access. The continued presence of the CVS lesion renders that extremity unusable for this purpose.</p><p>There are several ways that this can be accomplished:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical ligation &ndash; Surgical ligation requires the patient to go to surgery and have an incision made, followed by the tying of a ligature around the graft to occlude it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manual occlusion &ndash; It is possible to thrombose a graft by manually occluding it for 25 to 30 minutes. Although this is not always effective, it is a simple process, and, when effective, it saves the patient from a surgical procedure. This should be done on a nondialysis day to avoid heparin effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balloon occlusion &ndash; The graft can also be occluded by inserting a balloon of appropriate diameter to occlude the fistula and inflating it. The catheter should be filled with 0.75 mL of sterile saline and equipped with a valve to prevent premature deflation. The graft will clot within 25 to 30 minutes. We generally leave the balloon inflated for one hour as a safety measure. This is also best done on a nondialysis day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients and clinicians should be educated about the requirement for peripheral vein preservation in chronic renal disease. The use of central catheters, particularly subclavian and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), should be avoided in patients with established chronic renal failure or who are at high risk for developing end-stage renal disease. Suggested criteria include (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum creatinine &gt;3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&gt;265.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diabetic patients with proteinuria (&gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient evaluation prior to the placement of a permanent dialysis access should include a careful determination of prior episodes of central vein cannulation. If there is a positive history or if there is suspicion that the patient had a central venous catheter in the past, upper extremity duplex ultrasound and possibly venography should be performed. If these do not show any evidence of a lesion, then the extremity can be safely used for access placement even if there has been a prior central venous catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H177533298\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Use of ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H79681682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Access site considerations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a dialysis catheter is necessary, every attempt should be made to place a catheter in the right internal jugular vein, with the left internal jugular vein used as an alternative. The subclavian veins should <strong>not</strong> be used unless there is no plan for the patient to ever have an upper extremity hemodialysis access placed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H79681682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Access site considerations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the high incidence of central vein lesions associated with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), concern over the transvenous placement of these devices is warranted. The potential for loss of the central veins dictates the need for avoiding their placement on the same side as a dialysis vascular access. In addition, if such a device is already in place, the contralateral arm should be used for the placement of the dialysis access. Dialysis patients or those who are likely to advance to end-stage renal disease should be managed in a way that protects the central veins when a CIED is required. Physicians should consider the indications for CIED carefully in this patient population. (See <a href=\"#H81924511\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac implantable electronic devices'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a hemodialysis patient presents with evidence of a central venous lesion, a venogram should be performed as early as possible. Delay can result in complete occlusion of the vein. Individualization in the management of this problem is important. Efforts should always be made to preserve the access, whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H1234101750\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H204766401\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to note that not all patients with subclavian vein stenosis and obstruction are symptomatic. In patients who develop the problem slowly and remain asymptomatic, collateral vessels may adequately decompress the system. In this circumstance, it is best not to intervene provided the patient remains asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H1234101750\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment becomes necessary if the patient is symptomatic or has hemodynamic problems from the lesion. In these cases, balloon venoplasty is the initial treatment. If the elastic recoil persists after venoplasty to a degree that affects blood flow or it recurs rapidly (within three months or less), placement of a stent can be considered. There is no evidence to suggest that stenting under other circumstances is of any value. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although direct surgical reconstruction of the central veins is complex, patients with symptomatic lesions that are totally occlusive, unresponsive to venoplasty with stenting, or recur rapidly in spite of angioplasty and stenting should be referred for surgical consultation.
