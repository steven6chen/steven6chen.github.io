Up to 5 percent of hospitalized patients may have low serum phosphate concentrations (less than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> although prevalences of over 30 to 50 percent have been reported in alcoholic patients and patients with severe sepsis or trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Profound hypophosphatemia (less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> which can lead to physiological disturbances and symptoms, is much less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

The diagnosis and treatment of hypophosphatemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERNAL REDISTRIBUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stimulation of glycolysis increases the formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle. The source of this phosphate is the inorganic phosphate in the extracellular fluid; as a result, serum phosphate concentrations (and urinary phosphate excretion) fall rapidly. This occurs in several situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased insulin secretion, particularly during refeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal subjects, the administration of insulin or glucose (which stimulates endogenous insulin release) results in only a small decrease in serum phosphate concentrations. Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> and epinephrine can also cause mild hypophosphatemia by a similar mechanism.</p><p>If, however, there is underlying phosphate depletion, severe hypophosphatemia may ensue. It is most likely to occur during treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperglycemia (in which the glucose-induced osmotic diuresis results in loss of phosphate in the urine); during carbohydrate refeeding in malnourished patients with alcoholism or anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]; and in patients receiving hyperalimentation. Concurrent respiratory alkalosis may also contribute in alcoholic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Serum phosphate'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypophosphatemia in the alcoholic patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute respiratory alkalosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fall in partial pressure of carbon dioxide during acute respiratory alkalosis results in a similar change in the cells because carbon dioxide readily diffuses across cell membranes. The resulting rise in intracellular pH stimulates phosphofructokinase activity which in turn stimulates glycolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Extreme hyperventilation (to PCO2 &lt;20 mmHg) in normal subjects can lower serum phosphate concentrations to below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and it is probably the most common cause of marked hypophosphatemia in hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Less pronounced hypophosphatemia may occur during the increase in ventilation after successful treatment of severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The effects of mild respiratory alkalosis to induce falls in serum phosphate of &gt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> require concomitant glucose infusions and may persist after hyperventilation ceases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Respiratory alkalosis also may be the precipitating factor in the hypophosphatemia-induced acute rhabdomyolysis that can occur in alcoholic patients. In these patients, however, the underlying hypophosphatemia may be masked initially due to the release of phosphate from the injured muscle cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypophosphatemia in the alcoholic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hungry bone syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parathyroidectomy (for primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism) or, rarely, thyroidectomy (for hyperthyroidism) in patients with preexisting osteopenia can rarely result in marked deposition of calcium and phosphate in bone in the immediate postoperative period. This phenomenon, called the hungry bone syndrome, may be associated with marked hypocalcemia (which may be symptomatic) and hypophosphatemia. A similar phenomenon may occur after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hungry bone syndrome following parathyroidectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DECREASED INTESTINAL ABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal adults are in phosphate balance. Their dietary intake of phosphate, which usually ranges from 800 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> is usually well in excess of gastrointestinal losses, and, therefore, variations in intake usually have little effect on phosphate homeostasis. There is little regulation of gut absorption (although calcitriol, the most active metabolite of vitamin D, does have some stimulatory effect). Approximately 80 percent of dietary phosphate is absorbed in the small intestine. In addition, 150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is secreted in the colon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor intake alone is rarely responsible for severe phosphate depletion because of rapid renal adaptation, whereby renal tubular phosphate reabsorption approaches 100 percent, and, therefore, urinary phosphate excretion approaches zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. If, however, phosphate deprivation is prolonged and severe (intake of less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> then continued colonic phosphate secretion can lead to hypophosphatemia. More often, poor intake is combined with chronic diarrhea to cause markedly negative phosphate balance. These patients may also have poor intake or malabsorption of vitamin D. The secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by vitamin D deficiency can worsen phosphate depletion by increasing urinary phosphate excretion. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Increased urinary excretion'</a> below.)</p><p>Total starvation alone does not cause hypophosphatemia, because of the lack of insulin and the associated increase in cell catabolism that results in phosphate release from cells. Refeeding of starved patients, however, can cause hypophosphatemia, unless phosphate is provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several drugs that can inhibit the intestinal absorption of phosphate, producing an associated reduction in serum phosphate. Antacids, particularly those that are aluminum and magnesium based, cause net loss of phosphate from the body by binding to both ingested and secreted phosphate, with the resulting formation of insoluble aluminum or magnesium phosphate salts. Prolonged high-dose treatment with these drugs can cause hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, and myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This has become less of a problem since the availability of other, more convenient drugs to treat acid-peptic disease, such as histamine H2-receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors. Hypophosphatemia related to prior antacid use is a particular problem postoperatively in patients who undergo hepatic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Various phosphate binders are used to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with advanced kidney disease, and inappropriate or excessive use in that population (particularly in malnourished patients) may induce hypophosphatemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Niacin and its derivatives can also promote fecal phosphate losses by reducing intestinal expression of the type 2b sodium-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-IIb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]; however, overt hypophosphatemia is rarely observed when these drugs are taken at commonly prescribed doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Steatorrhea and chronic diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Steatorrhea or chronic diarrhea can cause mild to moderate hypophosphatemia due to decreased phosphate absorption from the gut and renal phosphate wasting, the latter caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by concomitant vitamin D deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED URINARY EXCRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The kidney exerts a major influence on phosphate balance. Renal phosphate transport occurs in the proximal tubule (60 to 70 percent of the filtered load being reabsorbed) and in the distal tubule (10 to 15 percent of the filtered load being reabsorbed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Phosphate reabsorption is linked to sodium reabsorption via sodium-phosphate cotransporters in the luminal membrane. These transporters use the favorable inward concentration gradient for sodium (the cell sodium concentration is less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> well below the 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> concentration in the tubular lumen) to drive the active reabsorption of phosphate.</p><p>Physiologic regulators of renal tubular phosphate reabsorption include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum phosphate concentration &ndash; Mild phosphate depletion stimulates phosphate reabsorption via the sodium-phosphate cotransporters in the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Phosphate depletion also leads to increased synthesis of new transporters, which increases tubular phosphate reabsorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) &ndash; PTH increases phosphate excretion by diminishing activity of sodium-phosphate cotransporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phosphatonins &ndash; Phosphatonins such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF-7), matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), and secreted frizzled-related protein-4 (sFRP-4) decrease phosphate reabsorption by sodium-phosphate cotransporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>].</p><p/><p>It has been suggested that gastrointestinal or bone sensors of dietary phosphate may lead to direct enhancement of renal phosphate excretion by an undefined mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], but this remains an area in need of further investigation.</p><p>The hypophosphatemia-induced increase in phosphate reabsorption protects against further phosphate losses. If inappropriately increased excretion persists, it is due to one of two factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a circulating factor promoting urinary phosphate losses, such as PTH or one of the aforementioned phosphatonins (eg, FGF-23)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intrinsic defect in phosphate transport</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any cause of hypersecretion of PTH can lead to hypophosphatemia. This occurs in primary hyperparathyroidism (in which hypercalcemia is usually the most prominent abnormality) and in secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by any of the causes of vitamin D deficiency. Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have mild hypophosphatemia. It may be more severe in those with vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism because they have not only increased urinary phosphate excretion, but also decreased gastrointestinal phosphate absorption. Animal models suggest that the mechanism by which this occurs may be due, in part, to a PTH-induced increase in FGF-23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D deficiency or resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D deficiency can cause hypophosphatemia both by decreasing gastrointestinal phosphate absorption and by causing hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, resulting in increased urinary phosphate excretion. Vitamin D deficiency can occur as a result of decreased intake or absorption, reduced sun exposure, increased hepatic catabolism, decreased endogenous synthesis, or end-organ resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58837 \">table 2</a>).

This gene encodes an endopeptidase that indirectly alters the degradation and production of FGF-23, a phosphatonin that promotes urinary phosphate excretion and suppresses calcitriol synthesis.

Profound hypophosphatemia (defined as less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> is much less common. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The four major mechanisms that cause hypophosphatemia include the redistribution of phosphate from the extracellular fluid into cells, decreased intestinal absorption of phosphate, increased urinary phosphate excretion, and removal by renal replacement therapies. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The redistribution of phosphate occurs as a result of the stimulation of glycolysis by the administration of insulin, glucose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a>, and epinephrine; during acute respiratory alkalosis; and as a result of hungry bone syndrome following parathyroidectomy or thyroidectomy in patients with preexisting osteopenia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Internal redistribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased intestinal absorption of phosphate may be caused by poor intake combined with chronic diarrhea or by prolonged use of antacids or phosphate binders that sequester both ingested and secreted phosphate. Poor intake alone is rarely a cause of significant hypophosphatemia. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Decreased intestinal absorption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased urinary excretion of phosphate occurs as a result of hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and several rare syndromes that cause isolated renal phosphate wasting. The Fanconi syndrome is a generalized impairment in proximal tubular function that causes urinary wasting of phosphate as well as other compounds. In adults, the Fanconi syndrome is most often due to multiple myeloma; in children, cystinosis, Wilson's disease, and hereditary fructose intolerance are the most common causes of the syndrome. Other factors that may increase urinary phosphate excretion include osmotic diuresis, proximally acting diuretics, acute volume expansion, intravenous iron administration, and several chemotherapeutic agents. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Increased urinary excretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypophosphatemia is a common complication following renal transplantation (possibly due to tertiary hyperparathyroidism and persistent FGF-23 elevation) and following partial hepatectomy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Primary renal phosphate wasting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15588904\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Zalman S Agus, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Larsson L, Rebel K, S&ouml;rbo B.
