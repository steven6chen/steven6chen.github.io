An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST and T wave changes. The T waves were not peaked, and the QRS interval was not prolonged.</p><p>The patient received 10 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> subcutaneously. The potassium level fell to 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> one hour later and 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> four hours later.</p><p>Review of the patient's medications revealed that the patient had been started on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> 10 mg daily and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irbesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irbesartan</a> 300 mg daily while in Italy. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril) and the angiotensin receptor blocker (irbesartan) were discontinued. The patient remains on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> 25 mg daily. In the hospital, the serum potassium level fluctuated between 5.0 and 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. One month later, the potassium was 5.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) 8.6 percent.</p><p>At a subsequent office visit, fasting laboratory values are as follows: sodium 139 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> potassium 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> chloride 104 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and bicarbonate 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L;</span> blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> creatinine 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and glucose 217 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (12.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg supine and <span class=\"nowrap\">145/95</span> mmHg upright. A repeat potassium the same day is 5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> with a glucose value of 181 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The electrocardiogram is unchanged from the previous tracing. The patient and her family state that the patient has not resumed the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irbesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irbesartan</a> and has not begun any new medications. She has been following the low potassium diet and counting carbohydrates with care, especially in view of the recent emergency hospitalization for hyperkalemia.</p><p>How would you manage the patient at this time?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You review the patient's glucose diary. The glucose values are in the high 100s and low 200s before meals and at bedtime. You increase the doses of NPH insulin before breakfast and at bedtime to improve control of the diabetes and of the serum potassium level.
