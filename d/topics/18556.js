They can be classified as either complete, when both the trachea and esophagus are fully encircled by a vascular anomaly, or incomplete without full encirclement of both structures.</p><p>The different forms of vascular rings and slings, and their clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H680242161\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beginning at the fourth week of embryogenesis, the aortic arch develops from six symmetrical paired aortic arch vessels and the paired dorsal aortae. During the next few weeks of embryogenesis, remodeling and rearrangement of these structures result in the formation of the normal left aortic arch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The right and left third arches persist as the right and left carotid arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left fourth arch persists as the transverse arch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The right and left subclavian arteries arise from the seventh intersegmental arteries along the posterior body wall and are remodeled into the final aortic arch.</p><p/><p>Abnormal development of this complex vascular remodeling process results in malformations, which lead to the different forms of vascular rings, slings, and other anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Left aortic arch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal left aortic arch crosses over the left mainstem bronchus, and typically descends along the left side of the spine. The aortic arch gives rise to three vessels:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Innominate (or brachiocephalic) artery, which bifurcates into the right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left common carotid artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left subclavian artery.</p><p/><p>The ductus arteriosus arises from the undersurface of the arch opposite the origin of the left subclavian artery. Following birth, it involutes into the ligamentum arteriosum.</p><p>There are a few anatomic variants of aortic arch branching that are not associated with any symptoms and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common brachiocephalic trunk trifurcates into the right subclavian, the right common carotid, and the left common carotid arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four vessels can arise directly from the arch with two different patterns:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition to the usual three vessels, a vertebral artery can arise from the arch between the left common carotid and the left subclavian.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An aberrant right subclavian artery can arise posteriorly to the left subclavian artery; if the ductus arteriosus is left-sided, then there is not compression of the trachea or esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Right aortic arch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A right aortic arch crosses the right mainstem bronchus and descends along the right side of the spine. Rarely, the descending portion of a right aortic arch may cross the midline and descend along the left side of the spine, which is termed a circumflex aortic arch.</p><p>Right aortic arches with mirror-image branching do not cause compression upon the trachea or esophagus, because the ductus arteriosus either arises from the undersurface of the arch opposite the right subclavian artery (true &quot;mirror-image&quot;) or from the bifurcation of the innominate artery, and then takes an anterior course in the mediastinum to the pulmonary artery without compromising the trachea or esophagus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular rings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular rings completely encircle the trachea and esophagus and are commonly associated with significant symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The majority of reported cases (90 percent) in retrospective reviews and case series are due to either a double aortic arch, or a right aortic arch and an aberrant left subclavian artery and left-sided ductus arteriosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Double aortic arch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In double aortic arch, the paired aortic arch arteries fail to remodel appropriately, which results in two aortic arches both connecting the ascending and descending aortas. The ascending aorta bifurcates anteriorly to the trachea and esophagus, with one arch coursing to the left of the trachea and esophagus and the other to the right (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73066\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73066 \">figure 1</a>). The arches rejoin into a single descending aorta posterior to the trachea and esophagus, thereby completely encircling the two structures.</p><p>The right common carotid and right subclavian arteries arise from the rightward arch, and the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries arise from the leftward arch. The ductus arteriosus may arise from either arch or both arches, but a single left-sided ductus is most commonly seen. There may be atretic segments of the arches, which must be identified prior to surgical repair. Typically, the right arch is larger and more cephalad in its course, and the left arch is smaller and more caudally located.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">R aortic arch with aberrant L subclavian artery and L ductus arteriosus/ligamentum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery and left-sided ductus arteriosus or ligamentum, the ductus arteriosus arises posteriorly in the mediastinum, courses anteriorly to the left of the trachea and esophagus, and connects to the pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61348\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61348 \">figure 2</a>). The trachea and esophagus are completely encircled by the right-sided aortic arch, the base of the left subclavian artery, and ductus arteriosus, resulting in a complete vascular ring.</p><p>In many cases, the left subclavian artery and ductus arteriosus arise from the diverticulum of Kommerell, a vascular structure with a similar diameter to the descending aorta, and a larger diameter than that of the left subclavian artery. This vascular structure may contribute to the posterior compression of the esophagus and trachea, and may produce symptoms even after surgical division of the vascular ring if it is not resected at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other rare causes of complete vascular rings include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left aortic arch with a right descending aorta and right ductus arteriosus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right aortic arch with a left descending aorta and left ductus arteriosus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian and a right ductus arteriosus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other vascular anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular anomalies that do not completely encircle the trachea and esophagus are often asymptomatic and are found incidentally.

The aberrant left pulmonary artery passes between the trachea and the esophagus prior to entering the left lung, leading to compression of the trachea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> esophagus. Pulmonary artery sling is frequently associated with complete tracheal cartilaginous rings; therefore, these patients should have a careful airway assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89097\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89097 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3749988255\"><span class=\"h3\">Innominate artery compression syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This syndrome occurs when the innominate (or brachiocephalic) artery originates later along the course of the transverse arch, resulting in a more leftward takeoff than normal.

Males have a 1.4 to 2 times greater risk of having a vascular ring than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Published reports are primarily observational case series of patients with vascular rings treated by surgical repair at tertiary centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. As a result, complete vascular rings, which are more commonly associated with significant symptoms, represent the majority of cases, as demonstrated by the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review from 1991 to 2002 of 64 patients who underwent surgical repair in a tertiary center in Boston, two-thirds of the patients had complete vascular rings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A chest radiograph including posterior, anterior, and lateral views should be the initial study to identify the underlying cause of respiratory symptoms. Magnified high kilovoltage airway films may be useful to identify a significantly compressed trachea. Anterior bowing of the trachea in the lateral view is suggestive of a vascular ring.</p><p>Following the chest radiography, several diagnostic procedures are available in the evaluation of a child with a suspected vascular ring. However, the choice and sequence of these tests have not been rigorously assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a result, the diagnostic approach is dependent upon the local expertise, experience, medical costs, and available technology of the medical center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>].</p><p>The different diagnostic procedures, including their advantages and limitations are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA</strong>) &minus; CT and MRA provide three-dimensional visualization of the vascular anatomy, which accurately makes the diagnosis of a vascular ring and gives detailed anatomic information needed to plan the operative procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are advantages and disadvantages of each modality. CT exposes the child to ionizing radiation, but with modern multidetector scanners, a study may be completed in seconds, thus limiting the need for patient sedation. MRA does not involve exposure to radiation, but image acquisition is longer (30 to 60 minutes) and sedation or anesthesia may be necessary, particularly for infants and young children, </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many centers use CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRA to assess all patients with vascular rings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10</a>]; whereas in some centers, the use of these modalities is limited because of associated costs and potential complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The choice of imaging modalities depends on institutional expertise and preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4-6,10,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,10,14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Echocardiography</strong> &minus; Echocardiography is often used as a complementary procedure to identify the presence of another cardiac lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/4-8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8,10</a>]. With experienced personnel, echocardiography can clarify vascular anatomy and visualize vascular rings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The advantages of this imaging modality are that it is noninvasive, readily available, and does not expose the child to ionizing radiation. Disadvantages are that it cannot detect atretic segments without patent lumens and thus is less reliable in defining arch anatomy compared with CT or MRA; it poorly visualizes the airway; and, in some patients, the examination is limited due to diminished acoustic windows.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchoscopy</strong> &minus; Bronchoscopy is often used to determine the cause of upper airway symptoms. In children with vascular rings, it will indicate the level of compression but it cannot determine the vascular anatomy or the presence of another cardiac anomaly. Bronchoscopy is an invasive procedure and may worsen the child's symptoms because of tracheal edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of bronchoscopy is dependent upon the institution, with some centers using this study routinely preoperatively or intraoperatively to ensure proper endotracheal tube positioning in a controlled manner rather than blind intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other centers reserve bronchoscopy for specific indications, such as determining the cause of upper airway symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, some patients, based upon presenting symptoms, may have first been evaluated by an otorhinolaryngologist or pulmonologist, who may perform bronchoscopy as part of the initial evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Barium</a><strong> swallow </strong>&minus; Barium contrast esophagogram (barium swallow) has largely been replaced by CT and MRA in the evaluation of children with suspected vascular rings. Barium swallow demonstrates a posterior indentation of the esophagus in all vascular rings except for the pulmonary sling, in which an anterior indentation and increased space between the trachea and esophagus are found. However, the precise vascular anatomy or the presence of another cardiac anomaly cannot be determined by esophagogram.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we initially obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate pulmonary pathology and the sidedness of the aortic arch. This is followed by echocardiography to identify the arch branching pattern and intracardiac anatomy, and magnetic resonance imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">(MRI)/MRA</span> to define the vascular anatomy.</p><p>We do not routinely perform <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagograms, as they do not generally add any additional information to that obtained by <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRA</span>. As noted above, we prefer MRA to CT angiography (CTA) because of the increased radiation exposure of CT in young patients, although conscious sedation may be needed. Other institutions with more experience with CT, or less expertise or availability in pediatric sedation, may prefer CT imaging.</p><p>We do not routinely perform bronchoscopy, but reserve this procedure for patients who exhibit <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of airway obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have shown initial antenatal diagnosis can be by fetal ultrasound that requires confirmation after delivery with further imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. In these case series, isolated vascular rings were diagnosed using &quot;3-vessel and trachea&quot; and &quot;supra-aortic branch&quot; views.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of vascular rings is broad because there are many conditions that can present with similar respiratory and esophageal complaints.

The division point is made in the smaller of the two arches, which is usually the left [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The approach is generally made via left thoracotomy, which allows excellent exposure of the division point. The ductus or ligamentum also must be divided to release the ring. In cases with a right-sided ductus, a right thoracotomy is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery and left ductus</strong> &minus; Surgical approach is via a left thoracotomy and the ductus or ligamentum is identified and divided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. If a prominent diverticulum of Kommerell is present, some centers advocate performing a resection of the diverticulum and reimplanting the aberrant left subclavian artery into the left common carotid artery to remove any potential substrate for recurrent symptoms of tracheal or esophageal compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Other vascular anomalies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary artery sling</strong> &minus; In patients with extrinsic tracheal compression without fixed stenosis, the left pulmonary artery is relocated from its right-sided origin to the main pulmonary artery, anterior to the trachea. In cases with complete tracheal rings, the affected tracheal segment must be resected or a tracheoplasty procedure is required. These procedures require that the patient is placed upon cardiopulmonary bypass support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Innominate artery compression syndrome</strong> &minus; In patients with severe symptoms (apnea, severe stridor, or recurrent infections), surgical correction is warranted. The usual approach is an aortopexy procedure, which lifts both the aortic arch and innominate artery anteriorly and to the left by suturing them to the posterior aspect of the sternum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative surgical techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>] and endoscopic robotic assisted techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] have been adapted to vascular ring ligation and division. Because an open thoracotomy is not required, the length of recovery may be shortened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. A single-center retrospective study compared short term results of VATS and open thoracotomy vascular ring division and found similar outcomes with respect to operative time, intensive care unit length of stay, and hospital length of stay between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-rings-and-slings/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Patient selection and preoperative imaging are critical for application of these techniques, as ligamentous structures are much safer to divide under thoracoscopic conditions than systemic arterial vessels with patent lumens. Patient size also may limit the use of endoscopic techniques, with a young infant being too small to undergo this procedure.</p><p>These alternative techniques are still in the development phase and are not widely available.

After surgical repair, slightly more than half of the patients were symptom free and those with respiratory problems had improvement of their condition following surgery. Approximately two-thirds of patients with feeding issues were symptom free after surgery.

In one case series of 300 patients, there was a reoperation rate of 8 percent.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete vascular rings are more commonly associated with significant symptoms and represent the majority of patients who undergo surgical correction for vascular ring anomalies. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In case series of surgically corrected patients with vascular rings, most patients present by one year of age with significant tracheal (stridor, recurrent respiratory infections, respiratory distress, wheezing, and cough) and esophageal (dysphagia, feeding difficulty, and vomiting) symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated anomalies are common in children with vascular rings, especially cardiac anomalies. Vascular rings can be seen in genetic or malformation syndromes such as DiGeorge or Down syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Associated anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic infants display signs of increased respiratory effort with nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, tachypnea, and intermittent cyanosis. Some infants will lie with their back arched and neck extended to minimize tracheal compression. Wheezing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coarse upper airway sounds may be heard during auscultation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach is dependent upon the local expertise, experience, medical costs, and available technology of the medical center. In our center, the diagnostic evaluation typically includes chest radiography, echocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography. This approach delineates the vascular anatomy and detects additional pulmonary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intracardiac pathology, if present. Bronchoscopy is reserved for patients with concerns of airway patency. We do not routinely perform <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagograms because they do not provide any additional information to that given by MRI. We prefer MRI to computerized tomography (CT) because of its lower radiation exposure to young children. Other centers prefer the use of CT imaging to MRI because it generally does not require conscious sedation in young children. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptomatic vascular rings, we recommend surgical correction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The surgical approach depends on the specific type of vascular ring. Clinical outcomes are excellent, with resolution of symptoms in the majority of patients and low surgical risks. For asymptomatic patients who are incidentally diagnosed with vascular rings, we recommend not performing surgical correction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).
