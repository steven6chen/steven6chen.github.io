Screening and intervention for tobacco use during pregnancy can be powerful tools to achieve smoking cessation. Pregnancy also provides an opportunity to educate the woman's partner or family members on the benefits of tobacco cessation for themselves, the woman, and the baby.</p><p>This topic will review the scope of this problem based on data for cigarette smoking, which is the most commonly used tobacco product. The scope of the problem, the pathophysiology of tobacco use in pregnancy, and clinical effects of cigarette smoking on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes will be reviewed here. Discussions of treatment options for smoking cessation in pregnancy, general issues of substance use during pregnancy, and smoking cessation in a nonpregnant population are presented separately: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking in pregnancy: Cessation strategies and treatment options&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alcohol intake and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Substance misuse in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3017716589\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased public health education efforts have contributed to generally declining smoking rates, although women continue to smoke while pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In England, the percent of pregnant women who smoked at the time of giving birth declined from 15 to 11 percent between 2006 and 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A study of United States birth certificate data from 2014 similarly reported that 11 percent of American women reported smoking cigarettes in the three months before pregnancy and approximately 8 percent reported smoking at any time during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Smoking rates were highest in the first trimester (8.2 percent) and lowest in the third trimester (6.6 percent). Most women who quit during pregnancy did so between the first and second trimester. Those who initiated prenatal care in the third trimester or had no care during pregnancy had the highest rates of smoking (15 percent). Subsequent analysis of 2016 United States data noted a small reduction in percent of women who smoked during pregnancy (7.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In 2016, women with the highest rates of smoking were those aged 20 to 24 years, of non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska native ethnicity, and with a high-school or lower education level. </p><p>The true prevalence of smoking during pregnancy is difficult to discern, not only because of incomplete records, but also because most studies rely on self-reported smoking behavior and are therefore subject to underreporting. Studies that use biochemical markers, including exhaled carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine, have shown that pregnant women underreport both smoking status and the extent of smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Published nondisclosure rates range from 24 to 50 percent. Exposure to secondhand smoke in the environment can result in detectable cotinine levels in the blood, saliva, or urine of nonsmokers; however, the level is typically lower than in active smokers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFYING MATERNAL CIGARETTE USE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3018562151\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale for screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying maternal cigarette use allows for targeted interventions to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. In 2002 in the United States, 5 to 8 percent of preterm births, 13 to 19 percent of term infants with intrauterine growth restriction, 5 to 7 percent of preterm-related deaths, and 23 to 34 percent of sudden infant death syndrome deaths were attributed to prenatal smoking (data on stillbirth were not available in this study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adverse outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>Further benefits of screening may include identification of women at risk of intimate partner violence and other substance use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey, which included data on nearly 200,000 women, reported that those who experienced physical abuse were twice as likely to smoke before or during pregnancy, compared with nonphysically abused women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This study suggested that additional and targeted screening for intimate partner violence in women who smoke during pregnancy may prove beneficial. Additional information on these topics is presented elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening#H2207911876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Substance misuse in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69590886\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All pregnant women should be asked regularly about tobacco use, including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and e-cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In clinical practice, screening for tobacco use is done by asking the patient if she has ever used tobacco products, if she used tobacco products when she found out that she was pregnant, and whether she uses tobacco products now. Women who smoke should be asked the number of cigarettes smoked per day. The approach to screening is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-in-pregnancy-cessation-strategies-and-treatment-options#H2923815506\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking in pregnancy: Cessation strategies and treatment options&quot;, section on 'General questions (5 A's) to smoking cessation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2911877192\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strong social norms discouraging smoking among pregnant women lead some women to fail to disclose their true smoking status as detected by measurement of urine cotinine, a nicotine metabolite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. As an example, a retrospective cohort study comparing maternal urinary cotinine levels with self-reported cigarette use noted 16.5 percent of women tested positive for high-level nicotine exposure, and an additional 7.5 percent tested positive for low-level exposure despite a self-reported cigarette use rate of 8.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Urinary cotinine screening of pregnant women is feasible in practice and could increase detection of tobacco smoke exposure among pregnant women. Cotinine is found in urine, blood, and saliva for approximately five days after exposure to tobacco smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360254112\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of other tobacco and nicotine products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tobacco is also smoked in cigars, pipes, and water pipes. Dissolvable tobacco products (chewing tobacco, snuff, snus) are not smoked, but are placed in the mouth and absorbed through buccal mucosal membrane. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) use an electronic delivery system that aerosolizes nicotine, producing a vapor similar to cigarettes, but containing fewer traditional toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the United States, approximately 3 percent of women &ge;18 years use one or more of these products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-cigarettes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;E-cigarettes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with use of these products have been reported, but data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. All of these products expose the pregnant woman and fetus to nicotine and other harmful or potentially harmful substances, are not associated with any health benefits, and should be avoided in pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SMOKING ON PREGNANCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several mechanisms have been observed or proposed to explain the adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal smoking. These include impaired fetal oxygenation, altered fetal development and physiologic response, and toxin exposure. Data on the mechanisms associated with e-cigarette use are mainly derived from animal models at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Smoking in pregnancy causes impaired oxygen delivery to the fetus by several possible mechanisms. Pathologic evaluations of the placentas of smokers have shown structural changes, including a reduction in the fraction of capillary volume and increased thickness of the villous membrane when compared with nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Both of these factors may contribute to abnormal gas exchange within the placenta. Exposure to cigarette smoke also acutely decreases intervillous perfusion, possibly via nicotine-induced vasospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The release of carbon monoxide during smoking results in the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which has multiple effects on systemic and fetal oxygen delivery. Carboxyhemoglobin is cleared slowly from the fetal circulation and diminishes tissue oxygenation via competitive inhibition with oxyhemoglobin and a left-shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>). In addition, smoking-induced oxidative stress may increase placental production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species as well as nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nitric oxide reacts with superoxide radicals to produce peroxynitrite, which can damage placental function.</p><p>In addition to impairing fetal oxygen delivery, nicotine use during pregnancy impacts fetal development. In animal models, nicotine increases vascular resistance and reduces uterine blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Chronic prenatal exposure to nicotine in these models results in abnormal secretion of neurochemical mediators in the brain, as well as pathologic behavior among the offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Further, animal models suggest that nicotine can directly impair lung development due to interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Using a primate model, one group demonstrated abundant expression of nAChR in fetal lung tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In a subsequent study, continuous subcutaneous infusion of nicotine into pregnant rhesus monkeys resulted in significant decreases in lung weight and volume and an increase in airway resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Prenatal nicotine exposure also can blunt the cardiorespiratory response to postnatal hypoxemia in sheep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Similarly, term human infants with significant cotinine levels at delivery are limited in their ability to maximize and vary their heart rate during the first four hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Beyond nicotine, smoking exposes the mother and fetus to multiple potential toxins. More than 2500 other directly toxic substances are found in cigarettes, such as ammonia, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hydrogen cyanide, vinyl chloride, and nitrogen oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition, there are over 4000 chemicals in mainstream tobacco smoke, which is drawn through the tobacco column and exits through the mouthpiece during puffing. The number of compounds emitted in tobacco smoke may actually exceed 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This toxin exposure may cause direct damage to fetal genetic material. One study compared the chromosomal instability of amniocytes from smokers and nonsmokers and noted an increased incidence of structural chromosomal abnormalities among women who smoked regularly (12 versus 3.5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Most of these abnormalities were the result of deletions or translocations, and many were localized to the 11q23 region, which is also associated with several hematologic malignancies.</p><p>Finally, exposure to nicotine results in sympathetic activation leading to acceleration of fetal heart rate and a reduction in fetal breathing movement. While the consequences of these changes are not well understood, both of these parameters are used as indicators of fetal well-being in antenatal fetal assessment tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal genotype may modify the risk of low birth weight (LBW) in cigarette smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A study of 741 mothers (174 self-reported ever smokers, 567 never smokers) who delivered singleton infants confirmed a reduction in birth weight and length of gestation in ever smokers (280 grams lower and 0.8 weeks shorter, respectively). In addition, continuous smokers whose genotypes were <em>CYP1A1</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">Aa/aa</span> (heterozygous and homozygous variants) and <em>GSTT1</em> (del) had significantly greater reductions in infant birth weight than those with <em>CYP1A1</em> AA (homozygous wild) or <em>GSTT1</em> present genotypes (520 versus 252 grams for <em>CYP1A1</em>; 642 versus 285 grams for <em>GSTT1</em>). Another study reported that fetal <em>GSTT1</em> (del) also significantly reduced gestational age-adjusted birth weight in offspring of smoking mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In a third study, maternal oxidative stress levels increased significantly as the maternal cotinine levels increased in mothers with null-type <em>GSTM1</em> (glutathione S-transferase M1) or wild-type <em>GSTT1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In this study, fetal cotinine levels were significantly associated with maternal cotinine levels, and fetal oxidative stress was associated with fetal cotinine levels.</p><p>A case control study of 910 Chinese pregnant women evaluated the effects of prenatal exposure to &quot;environmental&quot; tobacco (maternal passive smoking) and reported that, regardless of genotype, prenatal exposure to tobacco significantly increased the risk of LBW at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Those with the <em>CYP1A1</em> variant or <em>GSTT1-null</em> genotype had higher prevalence of LBW, and women with both <em>CYP1A1</em> variant and <em>GSTT1-null</em> genotype had higher rates. While the genotype appeared to have an influence on LBW in women exposed to tobacco, this effect on LBW was not observed in the nonexposed women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The <em>CYP1A1</em>, <em>GSTM1</em>, and <em>GSTT1</em> genes were studied because they encode enzymes (eg, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, glutathione S-transferases) active in the body's metabolism and elimination of toxic substances contained in cigarette smoke. These studies suggest that maternal genetic polymorphisms that influence the activity of these enzymes increase <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/fetal</span> susceptibility to the adverse effects of environmental substances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1057663467\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of smoking on offspring genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific epigenetic changes, measured as alterations in genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, have been identified in offspring of smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Additionally, epigenomic changes, including placental methylation and miRNA expression, have been identified in the placentas of smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A review of studies assessing the impact of intrauterine smoking on offspring DNA methylation reported that multiple strong, highly replicated methylation signatures have been identified at CpG sites in gene regions <em>AHRR</em>, <em>CYP1A1</em>, <em>MYO1G</em>, <em>CNTNAP2</em>, <em>GFI1</em>, and <em>FRMD4A</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Changes in gene expression in response to smoke exposure have also been consistently identified. Similarly, a number of differentially methylated placental genes have been reported in placentas of mothers who smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It is not yet known if smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes result in similar genetic changes.</p><p>In an ongoing cohort study assessing the effects of the prenatal environment and adiposity, cigarette smoking before and during pregnancy was associated with lower birth weight and body mass index (BMI) at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Neonatal methylation levels at three of the seven loci studied were significantly associated with the prenatal environment. Methylation levels at cg25685359 (<em>MIRLET7BHG</em>) showed a significant positive association with maternal smoking before pregnancy and a negative association with birth weight. Methylation levels at this loci also showed a suggestive association with BMI change in early childhood (up to 48 months).</p><p>The clinical significance of these gene methylation and expression changes is not yet understood but likely contribute to the adverse obstetric and neonatal effects of maternal tobacco use as well as to long term effects beyond the womb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tobacco use negatively impacts maternal and fetal health and carries over into the postnatal period.

Studies of subfertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment also showed a reduction in fecundity among women smokers. The odds of pregnancy per number of IVF-treated cycles were significantly lower in smokers versus nonsmokers: OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.49-0.88). Lastly, compared with oocytes of nonsmoking women, oocytes harvested from female smokers undergoing IVF have a greater percentage of immature oocytes, increased thickness of the zona pellucida, and higher levels of markers of oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/53,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56,57</a>] (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optimizing natural fertility in couples planning pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Tobacco use'</a>.)</p><p>The range of negative general health outcomes from smoking and the benefits of smoking cessation are discussed in detail elsewhere.

However, not all of the lung cancers diagnosed during pregnancy are smoking related. In one series of 2422 women diagnosed with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 160 were of reproductive age and, in 8 of these 160 women (5 percent), NSCLC was diagnosed during pregnancy. All of the patients in this series were either nonsmokers or light smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Metastases to the placenta and fetus have also been reported. Other studies have suggested a larger contribution of smoking in lung cancers diagnosed during pregnancy. However, the available reported cases are small and meaningful conclusions cannot be made on the precise contribution of tobacco exposure (including passive smoking) on lung cancers diagnosed during pregnancy.

However, in many of these studies, confounding variables (particularly maternal characteristics such as socioeconomic status, use of other drugs of abuse, and maternal cognitive ability) were not well controlled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To address this issue, a study analyzed data from the United States National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, which includes information on a wide range of potentially confounding maternal characteristics including maternal cognitive testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. In an unadjusted analysis, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were 2.9 points lower in children whose mothers smoked &gt;1 pack of cigarettes during pregnancy compared with children whose mothers did not smoke. However, when maternal IQ and educational levels were controlled, there was no difference in IQ scores between the two groups of children. In contrast, in a different prospective study that followed 131 individuals to age 16 to 18, intrauterine tobacco exposure was associated with lower late-adolescent executive function after controlling for multiple confounders including demographics; intrauterine cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol exposures; early childhood lead exposures; and violence exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Behavioral problems</strong> &ndash; There have been several studies suggesting an increased rate of behavioral problems in children exposed to prenatal maternal smoking independent of postnatal maternal smoking and use of other drugs during pregnancy.

A meta-analysis of 20 studies (15 cohort and 5 case-control studies) reported a 60 percent increased risk of offspring ADHD in women who smoked (odds ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.45-1.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>]. While the meta-analysis confirms association, it does not explain causality as there are multiple potential confounding risk factors. Another study of 1000 mother-child pairs reported that prenatal maternal smoking selectively increased the probability that female offspring would smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary function</strong> &ndash; Maternal smoking has been associated with increased incidence of asthma in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/172,173\" class=\"abstract_t\">172,173</a>]. In addition, a study of 16 mother-child pairs in which the mother smoked during pregnancy reported genome-wide DNA methylation changes that differed between mother and child, maintenance of those DNA changes in the child over years of life, and association of these changes with regions that contribute to pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>]. Thus, maternal smoking may result in epigenetic changes in the offspring that contribute to pulmonary disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Schizophrenia</strong> &ndash; It remains unclear whether smoking during pregnancy is an independent risk factor mental health illness in offspring. A large nested case-control study conducted in Finland reported a higher maternal cotinine level, measured as a continuous variable, was associated with a greater than threefold increased odds (odds ratio 3.41, 95% CI 1.86-6.24) of schizophrenia in their offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>]. Cotinine levels were measured from archived samples collected as part of the Finnish Maternity Cohort study, which had over 98 percent participation. There was also a dose-response with women with heavy exposure having the highest odds. This relationship remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders including parental mental health illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, a subsequent Swedish population-based study that adjusted for familial confounding by including data on siblings reported that the association between maternal smoking and severe mental illness was nonsignificant at both moderate and high levels of maternal smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>]. This study suggested that familial factors, and not maternal smoking, may be more responsible for the excess risk of mental illness. However, for purposes of this analysis, the study relied on maternal report of daily cigarette smoking quantity, which was typically recorded in the first trimester, and did not use cotinine levels. The authors justified this approach noting that in a separate validation study of antenatal visits, only 6 percent of women who denied smoking had cotinine levels consistent with active smoking. It is difficult to use these findings alone to dismiss the findings of the Finnish study. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic disorders</strong> &ndash; Adjusted analysis of over 73,000 singleton pregnancies from the Danish National Birth Cohort reported a 66 percent increased risk of Tourette Syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorders (CT) in children born to mothers who smoked 10 or more cigarettes daily while pregnant (ie, heavy smoking) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>].

The true prevalence of tobacco use during pregnancy is difficult to discern, not only because of incomplete records, but also because most studies rely on self-reported tobacco-use behavior and are therefore subject to underreporting.

All pregnant women should be asked regularly about tobacco use. The strong social norms discouraging smoking among pregnant women lead some women to fail to disclose their true smoking status, as detected by measurement of urine cotinine, a nicotine metabolite. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Identifying maternal cigarette use'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanisms, observed and proposed, to explain the adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal smoking include impaired fetal oxygenation, altered fetal development and physiologic response, toxin exposure, maternal genetic susceptibility, and fetal and placental epigenomic methylation changes.
