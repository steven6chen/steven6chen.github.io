OSA is also common in the general population, is often undiagnosed, and may be first recognized in the inpatient setting. These and other primary sleep disorders are important to recognize, as acute illness and other aspects of hospital admission may aggravate chronic symptoms or bring to light previously unrecognized symptoms.</p><p>This review will discuss the evaluation, consequences, and management of sleep disorders in hospitalized adults. An approach to poor sleep in the inpatient setting is reviewed separately.

OSA is significantly under-recognized in the outpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], and most patients are undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Use of a questionnaire will almost certainly capture more suspected cases than routine clinical care.

Very frequent or severe hypoxemia during sleep may signal a need to prioritize diagnostic sleep apnea testing and treatment, depending on the specifics of the clinical situation.</p><p>Of note, overnight oximetry, which can provide an oxygen desaturation index (ODI, number of desaturations per hour of recording), is not considered an adequate diagnostic test by most, if not all, insurers in order to obtain a prescription for positive airway pressure therapy. This technology is therefore best used as a risk-stratifying tool rather than a diagnostic tool at this time. Additional variables that can affect performance include the degree of desaturation required to determine an event (3 versus 4 percent), the ODI cut-off used (ie, &gt;5, &gt;10, or &gt;15) to identify significant OSA, and the definition of hypopnea used on the confirmatory PSG.

Pending additional validation studies in patients with significant comorbidities, selection of inpatients for HSAT should be approached on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with a pulmonologist or sleep specialist.</p><p>Importantly, HSAT has not been well studied or validated in patients who are at risk for more complicated types of sleep-disordered breathing (eg, CSA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoventilation), including those with heart failure, obstructive lung disease, and neuromuscular disease with respiratory impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

A full PSG may be considered intrusive in patients already suffering from poor sleep, thus limiting sleep time available for analysis. Additional challenges include disturbances to sleep due to ongoing inpatient care (especially if support staff is not directly on site), resource requirements, logistics, and issues of reimbursement.</p><p>Nonetheless, inpatient PSG may be an option in some institutions. A number of studies have shown the feasibility of performing PSG in a range of inpatient settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9,17,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,25,26</a>].

In a study of over 55 million pregnancy-related inpatient discharges in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database, OSA was associated with increased risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia (odds ratio [OR] 2.5), eclampsia (OR 5.4), cardiomyopathy (OR 9), pulmonary embolism (OR 4.5), and in-hospital mortality (OR 5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

After adjusting for potential confounders, OSA was associated with higher rates of ICU transfer (OR 1.5), intubation (OR 1.7), and a longer length of stay, but lower mortality (OR 0.9). Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying these risks, including potentially modifiable factors such as exposure to opioids or other drugs that may acutely worsen OSA disease severity.</p><p>Evidence also suggests that a new diagnosis of OSA made during hospital admission is associated with worse outcomes, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher rates of readmission and mortality at 14 months following congestive heart failure (CHF) admission (hazard ratio [HR] 2.9 for patients with an ODI 4 percent &gt;5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater mortality at three years following CHF admission (OR 1.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worse composite cardiovascular outcomes after admission for myocardial infarction (HR 5.4 for patients with apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &gt;30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher CHADS2 score during atrial fibrillation admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>By contrast, other studies suggest improved or no change in outcomes, including one study that found no difference in the rate of readmissions at six months following acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and another showing lower peak troponin-T levels during myocardial infarction in patients with OSA, suggesting possible ischemic preconditioning of the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2030059311\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is the mainstay of treatment for OSA. For most patients with OSA, fixed or auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment; alternative modes such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) can be used in selected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Positive airway pressure therapy'</a>.)</p><p>While it is not yet known whether inpatient diagnosis of OSA, with appropriate follow-up and initiation of treatment, translates into improved short-term or long-term outcomes, robust data in the general population indicate that PAP therapy improves symptoms of OSA, lowers blood pressure, and possibly improves cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Positive airway pressure therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1007568934\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with known OSA who use PAP at home</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inpatients with a previously established diagnosis of OSA who use CPAP or BPAP at home should be encouraged to use it in the hospital, as their condition allows. While some acute medical issues may preclude PAP therapy (eg, nausea and vomiting, use of a nasogastric tube in some cases, facial trauma or infection, mental status changes), most others do not. Oxygen therapy does not preclude use of PAP, as oxygen can be delivered in conjunction with PAP.</p><p>However, studies suggest that CPAP is used by only 6 to 26 percent of patients with a known diagnosis of OSA who are admitted to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32,33</a>]. Aside from acute medical issues, factors that may contribute to a low rate of inpatient CPAP use include lack of awareness or understanding of OSA and PAP therapy on the part of clinicians and respiratory therapists and a lack of available PAP devices in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3935528339\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with known OSA who use other therapies at home</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who use an alternative therapy for OSA at home, such as an oral appliance, should also be encouraged to use the device in the inpatient setting. In some instances, PAP therapy may be preferable during hospitalization. Examples include patients with documented poor control of their OSA with the home therapy, patients who did not bring their oral appliance to the hospital with them, and patients with conditions associated with worsening of their underlying OSA, for which the home therapy may not compensate (eg, new stroke, substantial new opioid requirement).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022814685\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with newly diagnosed or previously untreated OSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inpatient initiation of PAP therapy in patients with newly diagnosed or previously untreated OSA can be considered on a case-by-case basis, but there are inadequate outcomes data to support widespread adoption of this practice. There are also several potential drawbacks to consider in the inpatient setting.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the major problems with CPAP therapy in the outpatient setting is compliance, and similar problems may be encountered in the hospital setting. Data in surgical patients suggest that compliance with recently initiated CPAP is quite poor following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may not be inclined to start new CPAP therapy during acute medical illness. In addition, hospitals may lack optimal staff support for first-time CPAP initiation. CPAP is often administered in the hospital by nursing personnel or respiratory therapists, who may not have the time and expertise of a sleep technician for mask fittings, pressure adjustments, and other troubleshooting techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;, section on 'Interventions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a significant financial cost associated with starting CPAP therapy in the hospital.</p><p/><p>Despite these limitations, inpatient initiation of PAP therapy may be justified in selected patients, based on limited data that initiating CPAP following a new diagnosis of OSA may improve outcomes in specific inpatient groups. Such groups include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selected postoperative patients with previously untreated OSA.

In a pilot study of 46 patients admitted for acute decompensated heart failure who were diagnosed with OSA within the first 48 hours of admission, patients randomly assigned to initiation of auto-adjusting bilevel pressure support had improved ejection fraction (by 5 percent) compared with those assigned to standard of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Another small study found that the initiation of auto-adjusting CPAP following the diagnosis of OSA in patients admitted for congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or an arrhythmia was associated with decreased 30-day readmission rates in those who were compliant with therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disorders-in-hospitalized-adults-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
