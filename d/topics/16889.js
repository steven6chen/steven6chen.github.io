Any induction method is likely to be effective in a woman with a favorable cervix, whereas no method is highly successful when performed in a woman with a cervix that is unfavorable (ie, firm, posterior, and neither dilated nor effaced). Therefore, if the cervix is unfavorable, a ripening process is generally employed prior to induction. </p><p>Cervical ripening is a complex process that results in physical softening and distensibility of the cervix, ultimately leading to partial cervical effacement and dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Remodeling of the cervix involves enzymatic dissolution of collagen fibrils, increase in water content, and chemical changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80354\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80354 \">figure 1</a>). These changes are induced by hormones (estrogen, progesterone, relaxin), as well as cytokines, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide synthesis enzymes.</p><p>The two major techniques for iatrogenic cervical ripening are (1) mechanical (physical) interventions, such as insertion of catheters or cervical dilators, and (2) application of cervical ripening agents, such as prostaglandins. These techniques will be reviewed below. General issues regarding induction of labor and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS OF AVAILABLE DATA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpretation of available data on cervical ripening is hindered by several factors, which make it difficult to determine the methods of cervical ripening and labor induction, either used alone or in combination, that are most effective. These factors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A basic lack of understanding of the physiologic events that initiate and sustain labor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wide biologic variation in the progress of normal labor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to distinguish between cervical ripening and labor induction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of different clinical endpoints in research studies (eg, change in cervix versus length of labor versus route of delivery)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lack of trials comparing multiple methods </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate data on patient satisfaction</p><p/><p>Although it is relatively easy for investigators to report changes in Bishop scores (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65320 \">table 1</a>) as an objective measure of the effect of an intervention on cervical ripening, the Bishop score itself is not a clinically important outcome: it is useful only to the extent that it predicts the outcome of labor induction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin#H2415652634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;, section on 'Bishop score'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1082804111\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostaglandins are the author's preferred method of cervical ripening in women with an unscarred uterus. As discussed below, there are strong data from placebo-controlled randomized trials supporting their efficacy. Because contractions are often initiated, prostaglandin use reduces the need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> for augmentation or induction of labor, which is an advantage of this approach over use of balloon catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Balloon catheter'</a> below). Administering prostaglandins is also easier than inserting a balloon catheter. Finally, in the author's experience, patients are more satisfied with cervical ripening by prostaglandins than by balloon catheters. </p><p>Although excessive uterine activity is a disadvantage of prostaglandin use, these agents have a good safety profile in women with unscarred uteruses: the rates of low Apgar score, neonatal intensive care unit admission, meconium staining, and cesarean delivery are equivalent to the rates associated with use of balloon catheters for cervical ripening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The author&rsquo;s preferred prostaglandin for cervical ripening is prostaglandin E1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>) administered vaginally, given available evidence of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast, the authors of a Cochrane review concluded that oral misoprostol should be the preferred route of administration because of greater patient acceptability and because it may result in improved clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Either approach to misoprostol use is reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H1917456107\" class=\"local\">'Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol)'</a> below.) </p><p>Use of mechanical cervical ripening agents is also reasonable. Randomized trials have generally reported that use of a balloon catheter is as effective for cervical ripening as prostaglandins, and results in less hyperstimulation (tachysystole) with fetal heart rate changes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Balloon catheter'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92003895\"><span class=\"h1\">PROSTAGLANDINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of prostaglandins causes dissolution of collagen bundles and an increase in the submucosal water content of the cervix. These changes lead to a cervical state that is associated with greater success when labor is induced with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Prostaglandin analogs were originally given by intravenous and oral routes. Subsequently, local administration of prostaglandins to the vagina or the endocervix became the preferred route because the frequency of side effects could be reduced by local administration, while maintaining an acceptable clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Intracervical PGE2 is somewhat less effective than intravaginal PGE2 for achieving vaginal delivery within 24 hours (RR of not achieving vaginal delivery 1.26, 95% CI 1.12-1.41), but both preparations appear to result in similar rates of cesarean delivery and tachysystole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The author's preference is to use PGE1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>) administered vaginally.

Any degree of antecedent uterine activity reflects some activation of the biological pathways involved in the initiation of labor. Addition of an exogenous uterotonic agent could prompt excessive uterine activity. When administering prostaglandins for cervical ripening, clinicians should be mindful of baseline uterine activity and consider delaying or avoiding administration if the patient is having frequent, low amplitude, painless contractions or &ge;2 painful <span class=\"nowrap\">contractions/10</span> minutes. This is most important in patients who have already received at least one dose of prostaglandins, as there appears to be a cumulative uterotonic effect, which should be avoided. However, convincing evidence for uterine activity thresholds for when to avoid prostaglandins are not available; clinicians should use their clinical judgment, taking into account patient-specific factors such as grand multiparity because of the risk of uterine rupture, fetal status because of potential effects of tachysystole, the degree of <span class=\"nowrap\">discomfort/pain</span> that the patient has experienced with previous doses, and the total number of doses of prostaglandins administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2277345\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects of prostaglandins include tachysystole, fever, chills, vomiting, and diarrhea. The frequency of these side effects depends on the type of prostaglandin, dose, and route of administration. Uterine contractile abnormalities are encountered in up to 30 percent of cases depending on the vehicle and route of administration; other systemic effects occur in up to 5 percent of cases. Treatment of maternal discomfort is supportive. </p><p>Although comparative trials using prostaglandins have not reported changes in the rate of adverse perinatal outcomes, these reports have been of insufficient size to exclude the possibility of uncommon serious side effects, such as uterine rupture.

Alternatively, the catheter can be inserted manually, similar to an intrauterine pressure catheter. This is usually possible even if the cervix is not dilated since the pregnant cervix is soft and distensible and rarely tightly closed. If it is difficult to pass the catheter, a urologic sound or sterile Q-tip can be placed inside it and used to direct placement. After the sound has been removed, the balloon is distended with saline and retracted so that it rests against the internal os. Many clinicians will tape the end of the catheter to the inner thigh, placing it on tension and readjusting every 30 minutes. A randomized trial noted a decrease in time to balloon expulsion with this practice, but no effect on the time to delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Hygroscopic dilators are safe and effective for dilating the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], although they are used primarily during pregnancy termination rather than for preinduction cervical ripening of term pregnancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Cervical preparation'</a>.)</p><p>Hygroscopic dilators are designed to absorb moisture and thus gradually expand within the cervical canal. They probably function by disrupting the chorioamniotic decidual interface, causing lysosomal destruction and prostaglandin release. These events lead to active stretching of the cervix beyond the passive mechanical stretching provided by the tent itself.</p><p>Some clinicians prefer to use hygroscopic dilators rather than balloon catheters in patients with a prior cesarean delivery who are scheduled for induction of labor. There is no evidence to recommend one approach over the other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2277617\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insertion of a large number of small diameter hygroscopic dilators (2 or 3 mm) is preferable to using a few large ones (6 mm) because placement is easier and results in greater cervical dilation. After prepping the cervix and vagina with an antiseptic, the cervix is held with a nontraumatic clamp, if necessary, and as many dilators as possible are inserted into the endocervical canal without using excessive force; some cramping is common. Dipping the laminaria in a sterile lubricant before insertion may facilitate placement. The dilators can be packed in place with two 4- by 4-inch gauze sponges tucked into the fornices, and the number of dilators and gauze sponges that were inserted should be recorded in the patient&rsquo;s chart. </p><p>Laminaria are removed 12 to 24 hours after placement, whereas synthetic dilators can be removed sooner, after 6 to 8 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2277624\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> or a prostaglandin plus hygroscopic dilators with use of oxytocin or a prostaglandin alone found statistically similar rates of cesarean delivery whether or not hygroscopic dilators were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In placebo-controlled trials of hygroscopic dilators, use of dilators did not reduce the rate of cesarean delivery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76-1.30) or failure to deliver vaginally within 24 hours (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.64-1.26). </p><p>These data suggest that although hygroscopic dilators can dilate the cervix, they are inadequate for improving the outcome of induction.

The available body of evidence is insufficient to support a recommendation for the most effective and safest approach, but suggests that outpatient approaches are feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].</p><p>Published studies reflect a variety of different approaches to cervical ripening, including local applications of prostaglandin compounds and placement of balloon catheters to the lower uterine segment with or without immediate hospitalization for further labor management.

Clinical studies of human parturition are hindered by a lack of understanding of the physiologic events that initiate and sustain labor. There is wide biologic variation among pregnant women in the progress of normal labor and iatrogenic variation in the management of labor and labor induction; this makes the investigation of new uterotonic agents difficult. Although data from randomized trials comparing two cervical ripening approaches are available, there are insufficient comparative data to determine which of several methods is the most effective and offers the best safety profile. Variation in indications for induction, parity, and gestational age at induction, as well as other demographic features, undoubtedly affects clinical results. A randomized trial of sufficient size to reliably assess the efficacy, safety, patient satisfaction, and cost of the various options is needed, but may never be conducted. Although there is increasing interest in outpatient approaches to cervical ripening, evidence to support the safety of this practice is weak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20153268\"><span class=\"h2\">Unfavorable cervix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who are scheduled for labor induction and have an unfavorable cervix, clinical outcomes are similar whether prostaglandins (E2 or E1)or transcervical balloon catheter placement is used for cervical ripening.
