Rotation of the stomach more than 180&deg; causes complete gastric outlet obstruction, and potentially strangulation of the stomach leading to ischemia, and potentially necrosis, perforation, and abdominal sepsis. Mortality related to acute gastric volvulus is high if unrecognized, underscoring the need for early diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>The classification, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of gastric volvulus will be reviewed here. General considerations for gastric outlet obstruction are discussed elsewhere.

The incidence peaks after the fifth decade with adults constituting 80 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. No association with sex or race has been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606324922\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for gastric volvulus in adults include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;50 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphragmatic abnormalities (eg, paraesophageal hernia, hiatal hernia, other diaphragm hernia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphragm eventration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phrenic nerve paralysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other anatomic gastrointestinal (eg, stomach) or splenic abnormalities </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kyphoscoliosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606324982\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric volvulus is characterized by abnormal rotation of the stomach along its horizontal or vertical axis. The stomach is normally maintained in position by several ligaments that fix the stomach to other abdominal structures and to the diaphragm, including the gastrocolic, gastrohepatic, gastrosplenic and gastrophrenic ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86322\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86322 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Together with the gastroesophageal junction and pylorus, these ligaments anchor the stomach and prevent rotation. Gastric outlet obstruction occurs to a varying degree depending upon the amount of rotation. (See <a href=\"#H289880427\" class=\"local\">'Acute symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>With stomach rotation &gt;180&deg;, gastric outlet obstruction occurs, but with lesser degrees of rotation, the gastric obstruction is partial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Chronic rotation of the stomach can cause decreased venous return and increased capillary pressure that can lead to gastric bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606329650\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric volvulus is classified as primary (idiopathic) or secondary depending upon its etiology, organoaxial or mesenteroaxial according to axis of rotation, and acute or chronic depending upon the clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H289880427\" class=\"local\">'Acute symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26691034\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary versus secondary gastric volvulus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric volvulus is classified based upon whether the etiology is primary (idiopathic) or secondary. Primary (idiopathic) gastric volvulus is defined as volvulus due to abnormalities of the gastric ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Failure of the gastric fixation can occur as a result of agenesis, elongation, or disruption of the gastric ligaments due to neoplasia, adhesions, or skeletal deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, kyphoscoliosis can lead to primary gastric volvulus due to displacement of the viscera producing abnormal tension, and therefore elongation of the ligaments over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Primary gastric volvulus presents more commonly with chronic symptoms.</p><p>Secondary gastric volvulus occurs in two-thirds of patients with gastric volvulus and is defined as volvulus due to other anatomic abnormalities (ie, not primarily the gastric attachments), such as paraesophageal hernia, diaphragmatic hernia (Morgagni hernia, Bochdalek hernia, traumatic hernia), diaphragmatic eventration, phrenic nerve paralysis, as well as anatomic abnormalities of other organs (eg, stomach, spleen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1,3,4,6,9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,6,9-13</a>]. </p><p>In adults, the most commonly associated diaphragmatic defect is paraesophageal hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1,6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,11</a>]. Patients who have had weight loss surgeries, such as adjustable gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy, have also been reported to present with gastric volvulus as a complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>By contrast, in children, congenital diaphragmatic hernia is the most commonly associated anatomic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/11,12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,16,17</a>]. &quot;Wandering spleen&quot; (a mobile spleen only attached by an elongated vascular pedicle) and gastric volvulus have been described in association with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, both conditions resulting from abnormal laxity or absence of peritoneal attachment due to congenital abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26691041\"><span class=\"h2\">Axis of rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric volvulus can also be classified based upon the axis of abnormal rotation (long versus short axis). </p><p>Organoaxial rotation refers to rotation of the stomach along its long axis through a line that connects the gastroesophageal junction and the pylorus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83731 \">figure 2</a>). The antrum rotates anterosuperiorly and the fundus rotates posteroinferiorly. The greater curvature of the stomach comes to rest superior to the lesser curvature of the stomach in an inverted position (upside-down stomach) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Organoaxial volvulus is the most common type of abnormal rotation, occurring in 60 percent of cases of gastric volvulus, and is associated with secondary etiologies (eg, paraesophageal hernias, diaphragmatic hernia, and diaphragmatic eventration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Strangulation of the stomach is more common with this type of volvulus, occurring in up to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26691034\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary gastric volvulus'</a> above.)</p><p>With mesenteroaxial volvulus, the stomach rotates around its short axis through a perpendicular line connecting the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83731 \">figure 2</a>). The antrum becomes displaced above the gastroesophageal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With mesenteroaxial volvulus, rotation is usually partial (&lt;180&deg;) and is not generally associated with a secondary anatomic defect. (See <a href=\"#H26691034\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary gastric volvulus'</a> above.)</p><p>A complex form of gastric volvulus combines elements of organoaxial and mesenteroaxial rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83731 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102192354\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute versus chronic gastric volvulus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations associated with gastric volvulus vary depending upon the degree of gastric outlet obstruction and rapidity of onset. With rotation &gt;180&deg;, the patient will present with symptoms of acute gastric outlet obstruction (ie, acute gastric volvulus), whereas in those with lesser degrees of rotation, symptoms of partial gastric obstruction occur that can be intermittent and chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately 40 percent of patients with gastric volvulus present with an acute onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with chronic gastric volvulus can also present with acute symptoms superimposed on their chronic picture. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26691754\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with gastric volvulus come to medical attention because of symptoms, which can present acutely or chronically, most commonly with abdominal or chest pain. It is a rare condition, so it is often not initially considered as the underlying cause of these symptoms. The general approach to the patient with abdominal or chest pain is discussed elsewhere. Clinical features related to gastric volvulus are presented below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A history of risk factors associated with gastric volvulus as well as any prior injuries, surgeries, and known anatomic abnormalities should be sought. A history of other upper gastrointestinal diseases, such as a history gastroesophageal reflux may indicate the presence of a paraesophageal hernia and suggest the diagnosis, whereas a history of peptic ulcer disease may point to an alternative etiology for gastric outlet obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H606324922\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H102194220\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289880441\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute gastric volvulus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute symptoms include pain in the upper abdomen or lower chest associated with severe vomiting (which may become unproductive). The combination of pain, vomiting, and an inability to pass a nasogastric tube, known as Borchardt's triad, is present in as many as 70 percent of patients with acute gastric volvulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20</a>]. Hematemesis can occur due to mucosal ischemia or mucosal tears from vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1,10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,21</a>]. Also reported are pain related to pancreatic or omental ischemia, omental avulsion, or splenic rupture due to traction on these structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1,6,17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,17,21,22</a>]. With complete gastric outlet obstruction, the stomach becomes dilated and fluid-filled, manifesting as upper abdominal distention with dullness to percussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. The physical examination may also reveal evidence of volume depletion. Auscultation may reveal gastric sounds in the chest. Signs of peritonitis (abdominal wall rigidity, rebound tenderness) may be present if significant gastric ischemia due to strangulation or perforation has occurred. </p><p>Most patients undergo initial laboratory testing for the evaluation of acute abdominal or chest pain that includes a complete blood count, electrolytes, and possibly liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes. These studies may help identify patients who are volume depleted or experiencing complications but do not help establish a diagnosis of gastric volvulus. (See <a href=\"#H289879710\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with recurrent vomiting may have electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia or a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, or evidence of volume depletion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Laboratory findings may also include an elevated white cell count, which may be due to inflammation, and acute stress and pain related to acute gastric distention. However, if the white cell count remains elevated following decompression of the stomach and measures to control pain, it may relate to ischemia, gastric perforation, and abdominal sepsis requiring urgent abdominal exploration. (See <a href=\"#H606326238\" class=\"local\">'Gastric decompression'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1642632866\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Other nonspecific laboratory findings may include elevated pancreatic enzymes, and anemia related to mucosal ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102192728\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic gastric volvulus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic or intermittent gastric volvulus have vague and often subclinical presentations. Chronic symptoms include mild upper abdominal discomfort, dysphagia, bloating, and heartburn, and occasionally patients present with symptoms of pancreatitis. Chronic rotation of the stomach can lead to gastric ulceration, low level bleeding, and chronic anemia. Some patients with chronic gastric volvulus will have a history of multiple transfusions. The physical examination in patients with chronic gastric volvulus may be relatively nonspecific. Since the stomach is often located in the chest, there can be minimal abdominal distention. Patients may also lack abdominal tenderness. </p><p>In patients with chronic gastric volvulus, laboratory studies obtained in the course of evaluating the patient with chronic abdominal or chest complaints may show chronic anemia from gastric ulceration due to the abnormal stomach rotation. Pancreatic enzymes may also be elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289879710\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of gastric volvulus cannot be made with history and physical examination alone. Because it is a rare condition, it is usually not the foremost diagnosis expected as the cause of upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The evaluation of abdominal or chest pain typically involves plain radiographs or computed tomography. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289880427\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients suspected of acute gastric volvulus based upon clinical features, we suggest plain radiography as the initial diagnostic test. Classic findings may confirm the diagnosis indicating immediate nasogastric decompression, without further delay. (See <a href=\"#H606326238\" class=\"local\">'Gastric decompression'</a> below.)</p><p>The classic finding of acute gastric volvulus on plain abdominal radiograph is a single large spherical gas bubble located in the upper abdomen or chest with an air-fluid level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83730\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83730 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There is generally a paucity of air in the distal bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. With other etiologies of gastric outlet obstruction, the stomach retains a more normal contour (ie, not spherical) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65449\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65449 \">image 2</a>). A distinguishing feature of organoaxial volvulus is that it lies in a horizontal plane when viewed on plain radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83732\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83732 \">image 3A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/6,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11</a>]. Mesenteroaxial volvulus will have a spherical stomach on supine images but two air-fluid levels on upright films, with the antrum positioned superior to the fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83734\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83734 \">image 3B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. Prior placement of a nasogastric tube may dissipate the gastric bubble, but the course of the nasogastric tube will remain abnormal. </p><p>If the classic features are not present on plain radiography, but acute gastric volvulus is suspected, we suggest computed tomography rather than gastrointestinal contrast studies. Both will show the abnormal position of the stomach, but CT has the added advantage of showing the relationship of the stomach to surrounding structures and identifying anatomic abnormalities associated with secondary gastric volvulus. In a study of 36 patients with acute gastric volvulus, barium swallow was diagnostic in only two of four patients, whereas CT diagnosed all 26 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26691034\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary gastric volvulus'</a> above.) </p><p>Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen or chest typically demonstrates a dilated stomach, often abnormally positioned in the chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83733\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83733 \">image 4</a>). A swirl sign, in which the esophagus and stomach rotate around each other on transverse plane images, may also be evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>]. CT also defines other anatomic abnormalities, such as diaphragmatic defects, and is also sensitive for detecting small amounts of free air, gastric pneumatosis, or free fluid in the abdomen. CT can also be used to exclude other abdominal pathology as the source of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/2,6,10,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,10,17,23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289880434\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of chronic gastric volvulus relies on demonstrating abnormal positioning of the stomach on imaging studies (plain film, computed tomography), which are typically obtained as part of the evaluation of chronic abdominal or chest complaints. The classic features of gastric volvulus typical for acute gastric volvulus on plain chest and abdominal films are frequently absent in patients with incomplete or partial volvulus (rotation &lt;180&deg;). (See <a href=\"#H289880427\" class=\"local\">'Acute symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>Plain radiographs may demonstrate abnormal positioning of the stomach, but the findings may be subtle. If a degree of obstruction is present, the stomach bubble is less dramatic and air will be present in the distal bowel. These patients may exhibit no evidence of obstruction at imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If plain films are unrevealing, computed tomography of the abdomen may show the abnormal position of the stomach, and has the advantage of showing the relationship of the stomach to surrounding structures.</p><p>If the diagnosis remains in question, upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series are another imaging option and are sensitive and specific when performed with the stomach in the &quot;twisted&quot; state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/4,7,22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,22,26</a>]. The greater curve will be inverted above the lesser curve (organoaxial volvulus) or the pylorus will be seen above the gastric fundus (mesenteroaxial volvulus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83732%7ERADIOL%2F83734\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83732 graphicRef83734 \">image 3A-B</a>). A disadvantage of UGI is that is does not identify other anatomic abnormalities that might be associated with secondary volvulus. </p><p>Patients with chronic upper abdominal symptoms often undergo upper endoscopy as part of their evaluation. Although endoscopic diagnosis of gastric volvulus has a low sensitivity of 32 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>], endoscopy may be helpful for ruling out other upper gastrointestinal diseases in the differential diagnosis, aiding placement of a nasogastric tube, or providing stomach fixation using a percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tube. (See <a href=\"#H102194220\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H606326238\" class=\"local\">'Gastric decompression'</a> below and <a href=\"#H102193667\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic derotation and PEG tube gastric fixation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102194220\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other conditions can cause acute abdominal pain and gastric outlet obstruction manifesting with acute gastric distention on imaging studies. Acute gastric dilation can also occur in the absence of mechanical obstruction related to psychological disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, with acute gastric volvulus, the stomach contour assumes a more spherical contour (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83730\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83730 \">image 1</a>) due to the abnormal rotation. When the stomach is not twisted, the stomach is distended but maintains a relatively normal stomach contour (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65449\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65449 \">image 2</a>). The past medical history may suggest an alternative cause for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and, for many causes of gastric outlet obstruction, the pathology will be apparent on imaging studies (eg, mass, inflammation). The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and the many causes of gastric outlet obstruction are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric outlet obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102193888\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients diagnosed with gastric volvulus come to medical attention because of acute symptoms. If the diagnosis is made at a physician office or in the emergency department, admission to the hospital should be arranged. Direct admission to a surgical service or surgical consultation is appropriate for any symptomatic patient with gastric volvulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>].</p><p>Initial medical management of gastric volvulus involves stabilizing the patient (fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities) and immediate nasogastric decompression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86323\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86323 \">algorithm 1</a>). Intravenous lines should be placed and fluid and electrolyte therapy administered, as needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immediate nasogastric decompression relieves symptoms associated with acute gastric distention and prevents complications. With adequate gastric decompression, the stomach may also spontaneously derotate. If nasogastric decompression is successful, further management can be planned with less urgency; however, under most circumstances, repair should be accomplished during the same hospitalization. Given that most adults who present with gastric volvulus are older, medical evaluation should be undertaken to determine the patient's anesthetic risk for surgery, which may alter the nature of the repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During the period of time prior to repair, the patient should remain pain free, hemodynamically stable, and have no systemic signs (eg, fever, increasing white blood cell count) that might indicate tissue ischemia or abdominal sepsis. If abdominal pain develops or recurs following adequate gastric decompression, or other signs indicate that a complication has developed (eg, perforation), abdominal exploration is indicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606326238\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with acute symptoms and severe gastric distention on imaging or imaging features that suggest gastric volvulus, a nasogastric tube should be placed immediately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Gastric decompression reduces tension in the stomach wall and improves perfusion, decreasing the risk for gastric ischemia and necrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric outlet obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nasogastric-and-nasoenteric-tubes#H522921948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nasogastric and nasoenteric tubes&quot;, section on 'Tube placement'</a>.)</p><p>With successful passage of the nasogastric tube into the distal stomach, there is usually immediate resolution of gastric distension and abdominal pain; however, the stomach may or may not derotate spontaneously. Although distal gastric obstruction from stomach rotation may remain, the risk of gastric necrosis is reduced. If the nasogastric tube cannot be passed easily, endoscopy can be used to assist with guiding placement of the tube and decompressing the stomach. </p><p>Endoscopy can be used to assist placement of a nasogastric tube if placement of a nasogastric tube at the bedside has failed. In patients with acute gastric volvulus, endoscopic decompression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> derotation are best performed with a controlled airway (ie, patient anesthetized and intubated). Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents can occur, and patient cooperation with nasogastric tube placement is often limited by discomfort related to the volvulus. Endoscopy can be accomplished in an operating room or appropriately-equipped endoscopy suite with anesthesia availability. </p><p>Endoscopic decompression can be accomplished by directing the endoscope under vision into the stomach. While guiding the scope, minimal or no insufflation should be used. Once the scope is in the distal stomach, the accumulated air and gastric contents are suctioned to the extent that is possible. A nasogastric tube can then be placed either blindly following the endoscope, or under direct vision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the nasogastric tube is placed, a repeat abdominal film should be performed to confirm the position of the tube, effectiveness in decompressing the stomach, and course of the tube. The nasogastric tube should remain in place to keep the stomach decompressed until repair can be accomplished. Strangulation, which is evident by an inability to decompress the stomach with a nasogastric tube or endoscopic-assisted techniques, indicates the need for immediate surgical decompression followed by repair.

Without treatment, volvulus can recur leading to the return of symptoms and potentially complications. (See <a href=\"#H1642634680\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p>The approach to treatment needs takes into account the clinical presentation (acute or chronic), etiology (primary or secondary) and the patient's surgical anesthetic risk.

Surgical repair consists of derotating the stomach, removing any nonviable tissue, reducing any hernias, and repairing anatomic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1,3,17,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,17,29,30</a>].

The same approach is used for the rare patient who presents with acute primary gastric volvulus. If endoscopic derotation is successful, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. However, if endoscopic derotation is unsuccessful, derotation will be necessary, which is usually accomplished laparoscopically, followed by PEG placement in the operating room. (See <a href=\"#H102193667\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic derotation and PEG tube gastric fixation'</a> below.)</p><p>Placement of PEG tubes can also serve as a temporizing measure in hemodynamically unstable patients with acute gastric volvulus who have derotated (spontaneously or endoscopically), allowing time for the patient to be adequately resuscitated and permit surgical repair. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606334133\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic gastric volvulus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic gastric volvulus is more likely primary in etiology, although patients with secondary volvulus can also present in this manner.

For those with minimal symptoms, conservative management without intervention may be more appropriate, particularly if the patient has limited life-expectancy or is a poor candidate for repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/27,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,36-38</a>]. Observations from retrospective reviews that support conservative management over surgery for those with minimal chronic symptoms (mostly paraesophageal hernia) include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The annual probability of developing acute symptoms requiring emergency surgery was estimated in one review to be 1.2 percent per year, with a lifetime risk of 18 percent in patients over the age of 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although recurrent symptoms occur in up to two-thirds of patients, few patients require emergency surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/37-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In asymptomatic patients, it has been estimated that perioperative mortality needs to be below 1 percent to derive a benefit from intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102193562\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treating patients with gastric volvulus are restoring the stomach back to a more normal anatomic position, repairing any associated anatomic abnormalities, and preventing future stomach rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1,3,17,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,17,29,30</a>].

However, endoscopic derotation maneuvers may not be successful, and a surgical approach may, nevertheless, be needed.</p><p>If the stomach remains rotated on repeat radiography following nasogastric tube placement (bedside or endoscopic-assisted), endoscopic derotation can be attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

If the stomach derotates, the endoscope should be guided into the duodenum, ensuring the stomach is fully derotated. If the stomach is unable to be reduced endoscopically, then operative decompression and derotation will be needed. (See <a href=\"#H1642632866\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>If the stomach returns to a normal position, PEG tubes can be placed to fix the stomach into position. From a practical standpoint, we place at least two PEG tubes to prevent future rotation (organoaxial or mesenteroaxial) when fixating the stomach. One of the PEG tubes is placed into the gastric body and another is placed more distal in the stomach. With only a single PEG tube, the stomach can still rotate around the axis from the PEG to the gastroesophageal junction. PEG tubes are left in place for several weeks to allow adhesions to form between the stomach and abdominal wall.

The choice between these surgical approaches depends largely upon the experience and preference of the surgeon, and the available resources. </p><p>The surgical management of gastric volvulus is traditionally performed as an open procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although there are no randomized trials directly comparing long-term outcomes, observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/26,29,46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,46-50</a>] as well as indirect evidence from the approach to the repair of paraesophageal hernia and other diaphragmatic hernias suggest that a laparoscopic approach may be preferred to open surgery because it is less invasive and has the advantages of a shorter hospital stay and reduced perioperative morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/4,26,33,46-48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26,33,46-48,51</a>]. Since gastric volvulus is more often associated with paraesophageal hernias in older adult patients, a laparoscopic approach may be desirable, particularly in those with medical comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

There are often adhesions of the stomach or omentum that will not be appreciated until the stomach is nearly reduced. With methodical dissection, the stomach will eventually be delivered into the abdomen where it can be manually derotated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrectomy &ndash; Once reduced, the stomach should be examined for areas of ischemia. Decompression and derotation of the stomach results in rapid reperfusion. Ischemic areas that remain are at risk for perforation and should be resected. Partial gastrectomy or, rarely, subtotal gastrectomy may be needed; however, because of the robust circulation to the stomach, this is uncommon. If ischemic areas are observed, the tissue should be observed intraoperatively for 10 to 15 minutes after derotation. If color and pliability do not improve, resection should be performed or a second look operation planned.

Once the stomach has been reduced and derotated, the hernia sac is resected. The distal esophagus is mobilized, and an antireflux procedure and closure of the hiatus with or without mesh is performed. The surgical techniques related to paraesophageal hernia are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-paraesophageal-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of paraesophageal hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric fixation &ndash; Gastric fixation involves tethering the anterior wall of the stomach to the posterior aspect of the abdominal wall, which can be accomplished intraoperatively using percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes, or by directly suturing the stomach to the abdominal wall (open or laparoscopic gastropexy). Gastric fixation is not required following repair of an anatomic defect and is not routinely performed in clinical practice.

In a study of patients with chronic volvulus, recurrent symptoms in 44 conservatively managed patients occurred in 64 percent of patients, but did not lead to any serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>There are very few data with regard to recurrence of gastric volvulus following repair. In theory, surgically-corrected gastric volvulus should not recur, and if it does, it indicates failure of the anatomic repair or inadequate fixation of the stomach to the abdominal wall. In a study comparing recurrence rates associated with gastric fixation alone, recurrence occurred in 42 percent of patients using a laparoscopic approach versus 15 percent with the open approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-volvulus-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In the paraesophageal hernia repair literature, a recurrence rate of 8 percent is reported; however this does not reflect recurrence related to gastric volvulus, but rather the recurrence of a hernia.

Gastric volvulus is characterized by abnormal rotation of the stomach along its long or short axis, which leads to varying degrees of gastric outlet obstruction. If rotation is more than 180&deg;, gastric outlet obstruction is complete. (See <a href=\"#H9592225\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H606324891\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The peak age incidence occurs after the fifth decade with adults constituting 80 to 90 percent of cases. The main risk factors for gastric volvulus include age &gt;50 years, and diaphragmatic or other anatomic abnormalities that alter normal stomach fixation. (See <a href=\"#H606324891\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary (idiopathic) gastric volvulus is defined as volvulus due to abnormalities of the gastric ligaments. Secondary gastric volvulus occurs in two-thirds of patients with gastric volvulus and is defined as volvulus due to other anatomic abnormalities (ie, not primarily the gastric attachments), the most common of which in adults is paraesophageal hernia. Stomach rotation is described as organoaxial, twisting along the stomach's long axis from the pylorus to esophagogastric junction, or mesenteroaxial, twisting along its short axis. (See <a href=\"#H606329650\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric volvulus can present acutely without prior symptoms as a complete gastric outlet obstruction, or as a partial gastric outlet obstruction that may be intermittent. Acute gastric volvulus is a surgical emergency, and is associated with a high mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Borchardt's triad, which is abdominal or chest pain, vomiting, and an inability to pass a nasogastric tube, occurs in as many as 70 percent of acute cases. (See <a href=\"#H289880441\" class=\"local\">'Acute gastric volvulus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute gastric volvulus, classic findings on plain abdominal radiograph include a single large spherical gas bubble in the upper abdomen and a paucity of air in the distal bowel. These clinical features may be absent in patients with chronic gastric volvulus, and further imaging, such as computed tomography or upper gastrointestinal series, will be needed. (See <a href=\"#H289879710\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients diagnosed with acute gastric distention due to gastric volvulus, we suggest initial gastric decompression by placing a nasogastric tube rather than endoscopic decompression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86323\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86323 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is initially attempted at the bedside, but, if unsuccessful, may require endoscopic assistance. In addition to nasogastric decompression, initial management includes fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities.

The goals of repair are restoring the stomach back to a more normal anatomic position, repairing any associated anatomic abnormalities, and preventing future stomach rotation.

However, endoscopic repair does not address anatomic abnormalities, and thus, is less optimal for patients with secondary volvulus.
