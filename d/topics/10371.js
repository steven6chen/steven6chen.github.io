The disorder is commonly referred to as &quot;celiac sprue&quot; or &quot;gluten-sensitive enteropathy&quot; in the United States. It was first described by Samuel Gee in 1887 in a report entitled &quot;On the coeliac affection,&quot; although a similar description of a chronic malabsorptive disorder by Aretaeus from Cappadocia (now Turkey) was recorded as far back as the second century AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The six key elements in the management of patients with celiac disease can be summarized with the following mnemonic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C</strong>onsultation with a skilled dietitian</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>E</strong>ducation about the disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>L</strong>ifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>I</strong>dentification and treatment of nutritional deficiencies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>ccess to an advocacy group</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C</strong>ontinuous long-term follow-up by a multidisciplinary team</p><p/><p>Treatment of the patient with celiac disease begins with dietary counseling.

Its pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis are discussed separately. This topic is also discussed in an official position statement issued by the American Gastroenterological Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The discussion below reflects a 2004 consensus statement issued by the National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and guidelines developed by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Because the diagnosis of celiac disease depends on a clinical response to a gluten-free diet, patients are said to have &quot;presumptive&quot; celiac disease before starting on the diet. If the patient responds to the gluten-free diet, with improvement in clinical symptoms and celiac-specific serologies (eg, tissue transglutaminase antibodies, tTG), the diagnosis is considered confirmed. </p><p>It is important to perform serologic testing for celiac disease <strong>before</strong> initiating a gluten-free diet because these tests may be falsely negative if performed while on a gluten-free diet. Moreover, a clinical response to a gluten-free diet is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of celiac disease, or of non-celiac gluten-sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H477996429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Presumptive celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with a gluten-free diet is recommended for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes for all children in one of the following groups: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with characteristic findings on intestinal biopsy and symptoms consistent with celiac disease (including nonspecific symptoms such as constipation or abdominal pain).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with characteristic findings on intestinal biopsy who belong to a high-risk group (eg, relatives of patients with established celiac disease, or patients with type 1 diabetes), whether or not there are associated symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50751\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50751 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis confirmed by skin biopsy, with or without associated pathology of the small intestinal mucosa.</p><p/><p>Treatment with a gluten-free diet improves gastrointestinal symptoms as well as most of the non-gastrointestinal symptoms of celiac disease, and may reduce the risk of gastrointestinal malignancies, infertility, and low-birthweight offspring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are diagnosed with gluten sensitivity by a positive tTG or IgA endomysial antibody, but who have a normal small bowel biopsy, are considered to have potential celiac disease. Such patients are not advised to be placed on a gluten-free diet if they are truly asymptomatic but should be monitored and rebiopsied if symptoms develop. Treatment with a gluten-free diet can be considered in patients with potential celiac disease who have symptoms that are attributable to celiac disease. </p><p>Before considering a patient to have potential celiac disease, it is important to make certain that the intestinal biopsies were adequate. The histologic abnormalities of celiac disease can be patchy, so multiple biopsies must be taken from both the distal duodenum and duodenal bulb, and these should be evaluated by an expert pathologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, we generally recommend further serological testing using a second specific antibody (eg, antiendomysial antibodies). HLA testing may also be helpful; if the patient has neither the DQ2 nor DQ8 genotype, the likelihood of having celiac disease is very low. Because a child may not effectively communicate about symptoms that may herald active disease, periodic reevaluation for symptoms and growth is important, and an additional endoscopy with biopsies should be performed when appropriate in high-risk patients (eg, those with gastrointestinal symptoms and rising titers of celiac serological tests).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF A GLUTEN-FREE DIET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cornerstone of treatment of celiac disease is the lifelong elimination of gluten in the diet. The principle sources of dietary gluten are wheat, rye, and barley. Pure oats are probably safely tolerated by patients with celiac disease, but there is some controversy on this issue. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Oats'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cereal chemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much work has been undertaken to characterize the toxic cereal fraction within wheat flour that is associated with celiac disease. The term gluten is used to describe the protein fraction of wheat flour, often referred to as &quot;prolamins&quot; due to the high content of the amino acids proline and glutamine. Gluten can be divided into an alcohol-soluble fraction, gliadin, and an alcohol-insoluble fraction, glutenin. Prolamins from other cereals are secalins from rye and hordeins from barley. The term gluten is often used loosely to refer to all prolamins found in wheat, rye, and barley.</p><p>The taxonomic relationship between the major cereal grains provides a framework upon which their toxicity in celiac disease can be predicted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57365 \">figure 1</a>). As an example, wheat, rye, and barley belong to the tribe known as Triticeae, while oats belong to a neighboring tribe (Aveneae). Thus, avenin (the major prolamin in oats) is genetically less similar to gluten than gluten is to secalin and hordein. However, despite the greater genetic difference, the prolamins from oats, barley, wheat, and rye have immunologic crossreactivity, reflecting their common ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The antibodies that are raised against gluten proteins are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H477986526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'How to test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Oats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure oats appear to be safely tolerated by most people with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Several randomized studies in adults suggest that oats caused no differences in nutritional status, symptoms, or laboratory or histologic measures after one or five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], and a metaanalysis of 10 studies concluded that there is no good evidence that consumption of oats causes mucosal damage in patients with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among 165 patients included in the studies, only one developed histological changes. Similarly, two randomized trials in children with celiac disease in remission suggest that oat consumption is tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] &#160; There were no significant differences in clinical, histologic, or biochemical markers of disease activity during long-term follow-up.</p><p>It is possible that tolerance of oats depends on the quantity consumed. Oats contain a sequence homology (ie, QQQPF) with gliadin peptides, which have been shown to be disease-activating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, oats contain a small proportion of this homologous sequence, and this homology may not be relevant since T-cell activation requires larger epitopes. Indeed, some clinical studies suggest that tolerance to oats depends at least in part on the total amount consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Daily oats consumption less than 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> by patients whose celiac disease is in remission appears to be well tolerated, while larger daily intake is associated with disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Despite these observations, the long-term safety of oat consumption in patients with celiac disease is uncertain, and most studies that examined the safety of oats have included patients with relatively mild disease or whose disease was in remission upon reinstitution of oats in the diet. Furthermore, some patients may be exquisitely sensitive to oat prolamins. Thus, at the present time, a reasonable approach is to limit oat consumption to 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (approximately 2 oz) in patients with mild disease upon presentation or whose disease is in remission after a stringent gluten-free diet. The patients should be followed carefully for clinical or serologic evidence of disease recurrence after reintroducing oats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with severe disease should probably avoid oats altogether. Oats also should be avoided if the purity cannot be guaranteed, as contamination with even small amounts of other cereals can cause damage to the intestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For example, mills that are not dedicated to processing oats alone may cross-contaminate oats with gluten from other grains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consumption of a gluten-free diet requires a major lifestyle change since gluten is contained in a variety of foods that are commonly consumed in a Western diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79790\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79790 \">table 2</a>). Thus, it is important to provide written information and dietary counseling to improve compliance, ideally from a registered dietitian with expertise in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A number of resources are available for patients with celiac disease, including a variety of cookbooks, gluten-free prepared foods, and Internet sites (<a href=\"http://www.csaceliacs.org/&amp;token=MOSx24E6HB+txKpO0eF0Gibll+XkSqm6jSExEGo8WuuJzwXcHYdBgTlTOVATogmV&amp;TOPIC_ID=5907\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.csaceliacs.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.celiac.com/&amp;token=nEewIP08Ktv0DdrkttzjcM3HOTYVvotnqDkbdt2k+oM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5907\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.celiac.com</a>).

Furthermore, some patients consider symptoms to be sufficiently mild so as not to warrant the sacrifice of fastidiously avoiding gluten-containing foods. The problem is even greater among asymptomatic patients in whom celiac disease was diagnosed based upon antibody screening. The benefit of rigid gluten avoidance has not been proven since the natural history of celiac disease in such patients is unclear.</p><p>Several arguments favor encouraging strict adherence to a gluten-free diet in most patients with established celiac disease regardless of clinical symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite feeling clinically well, patients may have a variety of micronutrient deficiencies that may ultimately have clinical consequences (such as bone loss due to vitamin D deficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

A review of the literature by an expert panel concluded that the lower threshold of gliadin intake that causes mucosal damage is between 10 and 100 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Micronutrient deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest a daily multivitamin for patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease, as suggested by an expert panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Long-term vitamin supplementation is not needed after full recovery on a gluten-free diet. In addition, each patient's overall nutritional status should be considered so that nutritional and caloric deficiencies can be adequately supplemented. Patients with newly-diagnosed celiac disease should undergo laboratory evaluation for iron deficiency anemia (using a complete blood count, ferritin, and serum iron levels), and vitamin D deficiency, and any deficiency should be corrected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110592\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110592 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Routine laboratory testing for other nutritional deficiencies is unnecessary except in patients with very low body weight or other evidence of malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>A gluten-free diet may induce troublesome constipation since it is low in roughage.

Much of the bone loss is related to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is probably due to vitamin D deficiency.

However, children are more likely than adults to have fully restored bone mass after 6 to 12 months of a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].

Approximately 70 percent of patients have noticeable clinical improvement within two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. As a general rule, symptoms improve faster than histology, especially when biopsies are obtained in the proximal intestine. The reason is incompletely understood; however, a likely explanation is that the less severely damaged distal small intestine recovers faster than the proximal intestine, which typically is affected more severely because of relatively increased exposure to gluten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest measurement of celiac-specific antibodies (tissue transglutaminase [tTG] or antiendomysial antibodies) about six months after beginning a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There are some data to suggest that deamidated gliadin antibodies may be slightly more sensitive to gluten exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A decrease in the antibody titer, with eventual disappearance in most individuals, is an indirect indicator of dietary adherence and recovery. In one series, 35 percent of children with CD became seronegative for tTG within six months of beginning a gluten-free diet, and 55 percent were seronegative within 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>We also measure antibodies in children with persistent or recurrent symptoms at any time after starting a gluten-free diet. A rise in antibody levels may indicate that the individual is knowingly or inadvertently ingesting gluten again, and should prompt careful review of the diet. If patients remain asymptomatic, we measure antibodies annually to monitor adherence to the gluten-free diet. In IgA-deficient patients, IgG antibodies should be used to monitor dietary exposure to gluten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Although antibody testing is typically used to monitor response to a gluten-free diet, it may not be a reliable predictor of mucosal recovery. In one study of children who had been on a gluten-free diet for at least one year and underwent follow-up intestinal biopsies, about one in five (19 percent) had persistent enteropathy (defined by villous blunting or Marsh 3 damage), despite good adherence to the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. tTG was elevated in 43 percent of children who had persistent enteropathy, and 32 percent of children who had mucosal recovery.

A study in children suggested that a combination of tTG and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies (DGP-IgG) is a more reliable indicator of mucosal healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Larger and prospective studies are needed to further investigate these findings, and to establish the optimal monitoring strategy, which might include use of combinations of antibodies for follow-up serologic testing, or use of follow-up biopsies in all patients. &#160; &#160; </p><p>For children in whom the diagnosis is less certain because they do not meet one or more of the above characteristics, we suggest a second small intestinal biopsy 9 to 12 months after beginning a gluten-free diet to demonstrate histologic improvement.

The significance is at the moment unclear, but in many cases the abnormalities do not appear to be linked with dietary indiscretion. After checking for dietary non-compliance or inadvertent ingestion of gluten, other causes of villous atrophy should be considered in these patients.

In children with celiac disease, hyposplenism appears much less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and it may be reversible on a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Thus, it is unclear whether children with celiac disease have a significantly increased risk for pneumococcal disease compared with healthy children, especially after treatment with a gluten-free diet.

Alternatively, it would be reasonable to screen affected children for evidence of hyposplenism (eg, by counting &quot;pitted&quot; erythrocytes by interference contrast microscopy), and to offer the additional vaccine series to those with evidence of hyposplenism. Such patients also should receive additional meningococcal vaccination, as for other patients with functional asplenia.

However, the small amount of gluten contained in these products does not necessarily translate into refractory disease.
