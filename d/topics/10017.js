Despite the widespread use of LAs, awareness of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) and knowledge of its management are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Local anesthetics are often incorrectly thought to be without side effects or toxicity. LAST is always a potential complication, and may occur with all LAs, and any route of administration. LAST primarily affects the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and may be fatal.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathologic pharmacology, mechanisms, and clinical presentation of toxicity, predisposing factors, and prevention and management of LAST. Lipid rescue therapy will also be discussed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3713903370\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE OF LAST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of major local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) events (ie, seizures or cardiac arrest) associated with regional anesthesia is very low. Major LAST events have decreased markedly since the early 1980s, likely related to increased awareness and routine incorporation of preventive measures into clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1715459346\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of LAST'</a> below.)</p><p>Data regarding the incidence of LAST come from registry studies and retrospective reviews of large numbers of regional anesthetics, based on very small numbers of events.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective single institution analysis of approximately 80,600 peripheral nerve blocks from 2009 to 2014 reported three cases of seizures caused by LAST (0.04 per 1000), and no cases of cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of data from the multicenter Australian and New Zealand Registry of Regional Anesthesia (AURORA) included data from approximately 25,300 peripheral nerve blocks performed from 2008 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The overall incidence of minor and major LAST events was 0.87 per 1000 blocks. Major LAST events occurred in eight patients (0.31 per 1000), including seven cases of major central nervous system events (ie, seizure or unconsciousness), and one case of cardiac arrest. Ultrasound guidance was associated with reduced risk of LAST (0R 0.36 for minor and major LAST events).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from the French nationwide SOS Regional Anesthesia Hotline Service included complications related to approximately 150,000 regional anesthetics in 1998 and 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Seven seizures occurred during epidural or peripheral nerve block (0.07 per 1000), and there were no cardiac arrests caused by LAST.</p><p/><p>Other reviews have reported similarly low incidences of major LAST events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The incidence of major LAST may be higher with peripheral nerve block than with epidural block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but this conclusion is based on very small numbers of events. Minor LAST events (eg, tinnitus, perioral numbness, metallic taste) probably occur much more frequently than major events, and go unreported. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2872791588\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND PATHOPHARMACOLOGY OF LAST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All local anesthetics have a hydrophobic aromatic ring and a hydrophilic amide group. The intermediary chain may contain either an ester or amide link, and dictates metabolism via plasma cholinesterases or hepatic oxidation, respectively. Local anesthetics are mostly achiral with few exceptions: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> exists as a racemic mixture, while levobupivacaine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> are pure enantiomers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The chirality of these compounds account for some of their subtle differences in clinical effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The physiochemical properties of local anesthetics are responsible for individual pharmacokinetic differences among the clinically used agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>pKa</strong> and its relationship to the surrounding pH influence the onset of effect due to the proportion of charged ionized drug to its uncharged un-ionized form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Lower pKa indicates that a greater proportion exists in the uncharged state, so more drug is available to transfer across the lipophilic cellular membrane to the effector site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics#H2693192\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and physiology'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, <strong>lipophilicity</strong> correlates to potency, because a higher lipophilicity confers better ability to penetrate the lipid bilayer to the target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protein binding </strong>of the drug primarily to alpha-1-acidic glycoprotein, and to a lesser extent albumin, and tissue proteins relates to effect duration, serving as a reservoir for local anesthetic. A high affinity for protein binding decreases the effective circulating levels of free local anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p>All local anesthetics exert their effect primarily by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) at the alpha-subunit inside the channel, which prevents sodium influx, subsequent depolarization, and action potential generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This conduction block impedes pain transmission from neuronal cells to the cerebral cortex, thereby producing analgesia and anesthesia. Toxicity occurs when LAs affect cardiac sodium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] or thalamocortical neurons in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. LAs have other, wide ranging effects, including blockade of potassium and calcium channels, interaction with cholinergic or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and interference with cellular metabolic processes (eg, oxidative phosphorylation, free fatty acid utilization, cyclic adenosine monophosphate production). Such effects may explain some aspects of cardiovascular toxicity, and may relate to the mechanism for reversal of LAST with intravenous lipid emulsion. (See <a href=\"#H2122338723\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3308416761\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3036059017\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences in toxicity among local anesthetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>All local anesthetics (LAs) may cause local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST)</strong> with toxic plasma levels. However, cardiac toxicity and the relationship between central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac toxicity vary among LAs. Cardiac toxicity parallels the anesthetic potency for neural blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; the more potent local anesthetics, including etidocaine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, are more cardiotoxic than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2691863955\"><span class=\"h3\">Amide local anesthetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ropivacaine</a> and levobupivacaine, which are prepared in almost pure S isomer form, are slightly less cardiotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] and produce fewer CNS symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>.

However, systemic absorption from LA administration sites can also cause toxic blood levels, and may cause a delayed, gradual onset of symptoms and signs. Continuous LA infusion for regional analgesia can cause LAST by intravascular migration of the catheter or systemic absorption, and onset may occur hours or days after initial catheter placement. Rarely, LAST can occur after inadvertent low dose intraarterial injection during nerve block in the neck (eg, during interscalene block, cervical plexus block, or stellate ganglion block). In this setting, seizure usually occurs without cardiovascular effects, and usually resolves quickly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical application </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>LAST can also less commonly occur after topical administration of LAs, especially when the drug is applied to mucosal membranes in repeated or high doses. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a> used for topical oropharyngeal anesthesia is absorbed through mucous membranes, and from the gastrointestinal tract when swallowed.

As classically described in the literature, LAST occurs soon after injection of LA, and progresses through central nervous system excitation, central nervous system (CNS) inhibition, cardiovascular excitation, and in extreme cases, cardiovascular inhibition and arrest. However, in a review of 93 reported LAST events that occurred during regional anesthesia over 30 years until 2009, only 60 percent of reported cases followed this classic presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113648\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113648 \">figure 1</a>). In the remaining cases, onset was delayed or involved only cardiovascular (CV) effects, without CNS toxicity. In a subsequent review of 67 cases of LAST reported between 2010 and 2014, the distribution of signs and symptoms was similar to the previously reported cases, but a much greater proportion had an onset &gt;10 minutes after injection (42 versus 13 percent), and 22 percent occurred &gt;30 minutes after injection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F115426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115426 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F115425\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115425 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F115423\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115423 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F115424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115424 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3713903370\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of LAST'</a> above.)</p><p>The presentation and speed of progression of symptoms depend on the route of systemic absorption, the local anesthetic plasma level, how quickly the concentration rises, and the characteristics of the specific LA.

The more minor of these effects may occur with intravascular injection of a small dose of LA (eg, after an epidural test dose, or an incremental dose of LA during peripheral nerve block), or early after injection of larger doses. These symptoms and signs should alert the clinician to stop injection, and prepare for progression to more serious CNS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiovascular events (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113649\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113649 \">figure 6</a>).

Systemic absorption is increased at highly vascular block sites, independent of the drug or dose injected. In addition to total dose per body weight, these patient and procedural factors may significantly affect plasma levels in adults and therefore, contribute to increased risk for toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1386613568\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Free LA in plasma may be increased by a low alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) level.

Thus they may be at increased risk for LAST with repeat dosing or continuous infusion of LAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Pharmacokinetic data in humans and animals demonstrate similar beneficial effects of intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) on the blood concentration of local anesthetics, and supports that concept that lipid infusion accelerates redistribution away from brain and heart to reservoir organs such as liver and skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/107-111\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-111</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195040195\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of lipid rescue therapy is controversial. We recommend administration of lipid emulsion for patients with LAST who exhibit seizures or impending seizures, or signs of cardiovascular toxicity (ie, arrhythmias, severe hypotension, or cardiac arrest). We agree with the guidelines from the American Society for Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>], the American Heart Association (AHA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>], and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>] that lipid emulsion should be administered concurrently as part of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), if cardiac arrest is suspected to be a result of LAST. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037320085\"><span class=\"h2\">Available formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal lipid preparation for treatment of LAST is debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. The formulation most commonly used has been 20 percent lipid emulsion (eg, Intralipid, Liposyn III 20%, or Nutrilipid) which is widely available in hospital formularies for nutritional support. Some formulations are also available in 10 and 30 percent concentrations, and animal studies suggest that at least some aspects of lipid rescue may be dose dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Further study is required before recommending concentrations of lipid emulsion other than 20 percent for treatment of LAST.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> is prepared in 10 percent lipid emulsion. Propofol is never a suitable alternative to 20 percent lipid emulsion because of its cardiovascular depressant effects, particularly with the high volumes that would be required to treat LAST.</p><p>The commercially available forms of 20 percent lipid emulsion contain soybean oil and egg yolk phospholipids, and should not be used in patients with true allergies to either of these food substances. The manufacturers state that lipid emulsion should be administered by intravenous infusion only, but intraosseous administration has been reported in a case in which intravenous access was lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H318859207\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal dose of lipid emulsion for LAST has not been determined. Multiple organizations have published guidance for lipid rescue therapy, including the ASRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>], the AAGBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>], the AHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>], and the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. These organizations all recommend an initial bolus of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 20 percent lipid emulsion, followed immediately by infusion at 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/minute,</span> and repeat bolus as necessary for persistent or recurrent cardiovascular instability. ASRA and the AHA recommend using lean body weight.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These organizations have issued somewhat different recommendations regarding administration of lipid emulsion after the initial bolus and infusion as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>] &ndash; Continue infusion for at least 10 minutes after hemodynamic stability has been restored. Repeat bolus once or twice, and increase the infusion to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/minute</span> if hemodynamic instability persists or recurs.

Maximum dose 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over the first hour.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>] &ndash; If there is an initial response, followed by re-emergence of hemodynamic instability, the infusion rate may be increased or the bolus repeated. Where possible lipid therapy should be discontinued after one hour or less. Longer treatment may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4166411409\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of high volume lipid infusion for LAST is not precisely known. The most commonly reported adverse effect of lipid rescue has been the interference with laboratory testing, which may last for several hours after lipid administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/120-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">120-122</a>]. Centrifugation of blood samples substantially reduces interference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p>Rare cases of pancreatitis and deep vein thrombosis have also occurred. Lipid emulsion may interfere with filters used for renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>], and importantly, may cause fat deposition and blood clots in cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal membrane oxygenator circuits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3150540714\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapuetic uses for lipid rescue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applications for lipid rescue include toxicity associated with a number of other lipophilic medications, including antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-agonist, calcium channel blocker, cocaine, and diuretics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>].

Major LAST events (ie, seizures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac arrest) are rare, and can occur with administration of any local anesthetic (LA), by any route. (See <a href=\"#H3713903370\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of LAST'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>All local anesthetics have the potential to cause LAST</strong>. Cardiac toxicity and the relationship between cardiovascular (CV) toxicity and central nervous system (CNS) toxicity vary among LAs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupivacaine</a> is the most cardiotoxic of the commonly used LAs, followed in decreasing order of cardiotoxicity by levobupivacaine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3036059017\" class=\"local\">'Differences in toxicity among local anesthetics'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of LAST is highly variable, but often includes initial signs and symptoms of CNS excitation (eg, perioral numbness, metallic taste, mental status changes or anxiety, visual changes, muscle twitching, and ultimately, seizures), followed by CNS depression (eg, somnolence, coma, and respiratory depression). Cardiovascular (CV) signs and symptoms may occur along with or after CNS symptoms, and may include hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, followed by ventricular arrhythmias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asystole. (See <a href=\"#H2003780271\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation of toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient factors that increase the risk of LAST include extremes of age, renal, hepatic or cardiac disease, pregnancy, and metabolic disturbances. (See <a href=\"#H1386613568\" class=\"local\">'Patient risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of LAST may be increased for highly vascular block sites, and those that require large volumes of LA. (See <a href=\"#H3713367834\" class=\"local\">'Block site'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive measures that may reduce the risk of LAST during regional anesthesia include limiting the dose of LA to the least effective dose, using slow incremental injection and aspiration prior to injection, the use of an intravascular test dose, avoidance of heavy sedation or general anesthesia during performance of blocks, and using ultrasound guidance. (See <a href=\"#H1715459346\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of LAST'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LAST should be recognized and treated rapidly, with priorities that include avoidance of hypoxia and acidosis.
