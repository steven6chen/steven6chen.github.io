The use of HCT in sickle cell disease (SCD) is evolving. This topic review discusses the use of HCT in SCD. Other therapies for SCD including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> and chronic blood transfusion therapy, and an overview of SCD management, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term HCT will be used throughout this review to refer to transplantation of stem and progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). In specific discussions related to the source of stem cells, the source will be specified (eg, peripheral blood stem cells).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS AND BARRIERS TO HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HCT is a potentially curative treatment for hemoglobinopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The most extensive experience showing the durable nature of cure has been established in patients with beta thalassemia major for more than a decade. In beta thalassemia major, the course of diminished life expectancy is fairly uniform; criteria for patient selection have, therefore, centered on the availability of a HLA-matched family donor and transplanting the patient early, before severe organ damage has occurred, in order to achieve a better outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for transfusion-dependent thalassemia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In the case of SCD, data concerning the efficacy of HCT are not as extensive, due in part to the following factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of the disease is quite variable, and prognostic factors that might indicate which patients are most likely to develop advanced stage disease, and thus be candidates for HCT, are lacking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient eligibility is limited because of the presence of advanced stage symptomatic disease, often involving severe pulmonary and neurologic vasculopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious concerns about transplantation-related mortality, as well as the potential for treatment-induced malignancy, exist.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF DONOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Siblings are always preferable as HCT donors for individuals with SCD because of the lower risks of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft <span class=\"nowrap\">failure/rejection</span> with a related donor transplant. Siblings without a sickle cell syndrome and siblings with sickle cell trait are acceptable as donors. Inclusion of siblings with sickle cell trait as potential donors expands the donor pool to approximately three-quarters of the patient's HLA-matched siblings, although the proportion of individuals with suitable donors remains small. The safety and feasibility of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=filgrastim-including-biosimilars-of-filgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">filgrastim</a> (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) in individuals with sickle cell trait has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-trait#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle cell trait&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic stem cell donation'</a>.)</p><p>The possibility of using unrelated donors has also been investigated. As an example, the Sickle Cell Unrelated Donor Transplant (SCURT) trial is a prospective study of matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC; ie, non-myeloablative conditioning) in children with SCD and high-risk features. The study is divided into two cohorts based on the source of hematopoietic stem cells (umbilical cord blood versus bone marrow). The first report from this study, which included eight patients transplanted with matched unrelated donor cord blood, suggested that the rate of graft rejection with unrelated cord blood transplants was high, with five of eight patients having autologous hematopoietic reconstitution and graft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of the three patients who engrafted, one died of extensive GVHD. Results from the bone marrow arm are pending.</p><p>Trials are also exploring the use of haploidentical transplant using reduced intensity conditioning, which could further expand the donor pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In an observational study, 17 patients with severe SCD underwent non-myeloablative conditioning followed by haploidentical transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This therapy was well tolerated and was associated with long-term engraftment in 11 of 17 patients (65 percent). Further studies are needed to determine the risk-benefit ratio of this approach outside of a clinical trial.

After HCT, in addition to having a normal bone marrow with no evidence of AML, her hemoglobin S level decreased to the level of the donor, who had sickle cell trait, and she had no further vaso-occlusive crises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional studies with larger numbers of patients were reported from Belgium, with overall and disease-free survivals of 96 and 89 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similar results were reported in a French study involving 14 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The first multicenter trial from the US, published in 1996, reported results in 22 patients younger than 16 years of age who received a HLA-matched sibling HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patient selection was based on strict criteria, including patients with severe debilitating clinical events such as stroke, recurrent acute chest syndrome, and recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises. The conditioning regimen avoided total body irradiation and included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, and T cell depletion using either antithymocyte globulin or Campath antibodies. A combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and cyclosporin or cyclosporin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> was used for prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). An increased incidence of neurologic complications, with seizures in some patients, occurred; these complications were mostly resolved after prophylaxis with anticonvulsant medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of the 22 patients reported, 20 survived; 16 had stable engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells, and one had stable mixed chimerism. Four patients (18 percent) had graft rejection, similar to the 13 percent rejection rate reported among children with beta thalassemia major who received HLA-matched sibling HCT. Two patients died of central nervous system hemorrhage or GVHD. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival and event-free survival at four years were 91 and 73 percent, respectively. </p><p>A year 2000 US multicenter study reported on the progress of 50 children who received HCT from HLA-identical siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At a median follow-up of 39 months, the six-year Kaplan-Meier probabilities of overall and event-free survival were 94 and 84 percent, respectively. Of the 47 surviving children, 38 had full donor chimerism, four had stable mixed chimerism, and five developed recurrent SCD. The cumulative incidence of graft rejection or recurrence of SCD was approximately 10 percent. Similar results were obtained in a series of 100 patients undergoing HCT in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival, event-free survival, and disease-free survival for this latter group were 90, 79, and 81 percent, respectively.</p><p>The US multicenter study noted above also evaluated the long-term effects of HCT in 26 children who had at least two years of follow-up after HCT.

This is an important issue because chronic transfusion therapy, a therapeutic alternative to HCT, offers marked protection against first or recurrent strokes but does not prevent them. In one series, for example, 13 percent of patients had a recurrent stroke at a mean follow-up of about three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

All 10 patients were alive at a median follow-up of 30 months post-HCT, and 9 of 10 had stable donor engraftment at levels that sufficed to reverse the SCD phenotype.

He received two donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), resulting in easily treated acute GVHD followed by complete donor chimerism. Two years after the second DLI, the patient had a normal hemoglobin concentration and excellent growth and development.

Unlike the situation concerning HCT for beta thalassemia major, in which the major issue is availability of a suitable donor, the current dilemma concerning HCT for SCD revolves around patient selection and criteria for transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitations to the use of HCT in patients with SCD include the variability of the clinical course, which preclude predictions of which patients might benefit from HCT, transplant-related risks because of pulmonary and neurologic disease in patients with advanced SCD, and the need for a HLA-matched sibling donor. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Limitations and barriers to HCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In several series of patients who have undergone HCT for SCD, five-year survival rates were 90 to 97 percent, and transplant-related mortality was 7 to 10 percent. SCD recurred in some patients, resulting in a SCD-free survival of 80 to 90 percent. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical experience with transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend HCT for patients with severe symptoms of SCD that are unresponsive to treatment with transfusions and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> if an HLA-matched sibling is available as a donor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This recommendation recognizes the SCD-free survival of 80 to 90 percent after HCT, and the 7 to 10 percent mortality associated with HCT for such patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early HCT in young children with SCD has been explored as a possible means of reducing SCD morbidity and HCT-associated morbidity and mortality. However, because accurate predictors that can prospectively define the severity of SCD in infants and children have not been identified, the role of this approach has yet to be defined. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Early transplantation'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of alternative donors (eg, umbilical cord blood, mismatched related donors, or matched unrelated donors) remains uncertain in patients with SCD. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Alternative donors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-myeloablative conditioning regimens have been proposed to reduce regimen-related toxicity, but further data are needed to determine the long-term stability of engraftment in the absence of chronic immunosuppression. Preliminary results in two series of adults with SCD from two centers are encouraging.
