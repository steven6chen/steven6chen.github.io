The esophagus is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55616 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26549591\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of esophageal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early on, people might not notice any symptoms. They might find out they have esophageal cancer after a test for another condition.</p><p>When people have symptoms from esophageal cancer, they might have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing, especially solid, dry foods &ndash; This gets worse over time.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or a burning feeling in the chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hoarse voice</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26549606\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for esophageal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor suspects you have esophageal cancer, he or she will do 1 or more of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper endoscopy &ndash; This is a procedure in which your doctor puts a thin tube with a camera and light on the end (called an endoscope) into your mouth and down into your esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>). He or she will look at the lining of your esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Barium</a> swallow &ndash; Your doctor will give you a drink called &quot;barium.&quot; Then he or she will take X-rays as the barium moves down your esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; For this test, your doctor will take a small sample of tissue from your esophagus. Another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if it has cancer. Your doctor will probably do a biopsy during an upper endoscopy. A biopsy is the only way to know for sure if you have esophageal cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26549620\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has a spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your cancer and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26549634\"><span class=\"h1\">How is esophageal cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with esophageal cancer have 1 or more of the following treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Esophageal cancer can be treated with surgery to remove the cancer. If your doctor needs to remove part of your esophagus during surgery, he or she will reconnect your esophagus and stomach so that you can swallow food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy &ndash; This is the term doctors use for medicines that work with the body's infection-fighting system (the &quot;immune system&quot;) to stop cancer growth.</p><p/><p>Esophageal cancer can sometimes be cured with treatment. This is most likely when the cancer is found at an early stage. If your cancer cannot be cured, your doctor might do other treatments to help improve your symptoms. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a laser beam or electric current to kill the cancer cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing a procedure to widen or &quot;prop open&quot; the blocked part of your esophagus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26549649\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Regular follow-up tests usually include exams, blood tests, and imaging tests. Some people also have follow-up upper endoscopy.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean the cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26549664\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more radiation therapy or chemotherapy. You might also have other treatments to help improve your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26549679\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for esophageal cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26549694\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Barrett's esophagus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Achalasia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Barrett's esophagus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Achalasia (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
