It is generally understood that a manufactured substance cannot carry out the numerous and complex functions of blood, but terms such as &quot;artificial blood&quot; or &quot;blood substitutes&quot; remain popular with the media and the public. Research efforts have been directed toward products that perform the oxygen-carrying and other transport functions of red blood cells. These products are referred to as oxygen carriers (OCs) or oxygen therapeutics (OTs).</p><p>This article will provide historical and clinical background and updates on the status of ongoing clinical protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Red blood cell transfusion and other aspects of tissue oxygen delivery are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for transfusion (newborns) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusions in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for transfusion (infants and children) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for transfusion (adults) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for transfusion (critically ill) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of blood products in the critically ill&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal hemoglobin function &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen delivery &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-delivery-and-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen delivery and consumption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY OF OC DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts to develop substances that could replace blood date to the 17<sup>th</sup> century and continued into the mid-1800s, when hemoglobin solutions were infused experimentally into humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These efforts resulted in significant morbidity and mortality, mostly from the nephrotoxic effects of free hemoglobin and red cell stroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This discouraged further activity of consequence, but research was renewed when the wars of the 20<sup>th</sup> century raised awareness that an easily stored, transportable, and abundant OC was needed. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic was a watershed phenomenon that catalyzed early research in the 1980s and propelled the search for such a product to peak levels in the 1990s and 2000s. Additional factors that contributed to this renewed interest included the potential contamination of blood by other pathogens, immunologic complications of allogeneic transfusion, the need for pretransfusion compatibility testing such as crossmatching, and special storage requirements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of HIV from blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Immunosuppression'</a>.)</p><p>While efforts to develop OCs were underway, the infectious risks of transfusion from known pathogens continued to fall because of improvements in blood donor screening and testing. This reduction in infectious risk, as well as simultaneous efforts to develop pathogen inactivation technologies, may have decreased a sense of urgency for OCs. However, in a survey sponsored by a biotechnology company specializing in blood pathogen inactivation, at least 84 percent of 502 Americans surveyed essentially still perceived blood as a threat to patient safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This thinking may continue to perpetuate safety arguments as a basis for pursuing manufactured products. In addition, a public health problem that may continue to drive development of these products is the challenge of persistent blood shortages (general or type-specific) in the United States and globally. It is projected that by the year 2030 there could be a shortfall of 4 million units annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The worldwide need is for over 200 million units per year in countries that lack testing and storage capabilities to support an allogeneic blood supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>At the turn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century there was great optimism that rapidly advancing technology would imminently lead to OCs for use in a variety of clinical settings. Several products were in phase III clinical trials, but reports of adverse events, some serious, and regulatory concerns about safety led to termination of trials. Allegations that some companies may have misled investors or withheld outcome results and inability to obtain regulatory approval and sustain investor support resulted in the withdrawal of products from trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In 2009, two remaining companies filed for bankruptcy and discontinued manufacturing activities.</p><p>In spite of these setbacks, a pressing need for oxygen therapeutics remains, and work continues in the field. Although no OCs are licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States, new insights into the basic biology and physiology of hemoglobin and gas transport systems are informing the development of products and potential applications through FDA-approved protocols.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF AN IDEAL OC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ideal substance for carrying (and delivering) oxygen would have the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid availability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective oxygen-carrying capacity and provision of volume expansion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate physiologic interaction with nitric oxide (NO)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free of pathogens, to the extent possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal side effects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viability over a range of storage temperatures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long shelf life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Universal compatibility and elimination of crossmatching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cost effectiveness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate supply</p><p/><p>An additional benefit would be the ability of chemically or genetically modified products to work in special and specific clinical situations, mentioned below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF OCs IN DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, two major categories of OC have been developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113099 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoglobin for HBOCs has been derived from two mammalian sources: animal (bovine) and human blood, the latter primarily from outdated red blood cell units. Hemoglobin is first separated from the red blood cell stroma through ultrafiltration and purification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Mammalian-derived hemoglobin is then chemically modified by crosslinking, pyridoxylation, polymerization, or pegylation, which prevents the dissociation of hemoglobin from its native four-chain configuration into its basic alpha-beta dimers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Polymerization converts the four-chain hemoglobin moiety into larger two to four hemoglobin molecule containing polymers. Crosslinking of alpha chains prevents dissociation of the hemoglobin molecule into alpha-beta dimers, which, with a molecular weight of 34,000, would otherwise be small enough to be filtered by the glomerulus and cause hemoglobinuria and nephrotoxicity.</p><p>Polymerization and crosslinking appeared to have addressed some of the problems associated with unmodified stroma-free hemoglobin. Half-life increased from a few hours to 12 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Glomerular filtration of the products was decreased, reducing or effectively eliminating nephrotoxicity; and oxygenation was improved as a result of the lowered oxygen affinity of some of these products (eg, P50 as high as 54 mm Hg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17</a>]. However, trials of one of the cross-linked products demonstrated increased mortality, and, consequently, development of at least one particular HBOC formulation was halted for this reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Another type of modification, liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH), seemed to confer advantages such as a longer intravascular half-life and the potential for freeze-dried storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Significant immunologic reactions, mostly due to interactions with the liposomal membrane, stalled the development of this OC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Hemoglobin has also been produced through recombinant technology. This approach showed promise in the early 1990s and involved the use of <em>E. coli</em> transfected with human hemoglobin genes. In animal models, however, vasoconstriction attributed to scavenging of nitric oxide by the recombinant product, and elevated amylase and lipase levels were observed, suggesting decreased pancreatic perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Efforts on this product were abandoned in 2003.</p><p>SANGUINATE is a bovine pegylated carboxyhemoglobin that was previously available through an FDA-approved protocol for certain patients with severe anemia who refused or were unable to receive an allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This product is under active development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Perfluorocarbons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perfluorocarbon (PFC) products were among the earliest of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century OCs. A 1960s-era magazine that depicted a breathing rodent submerged in a beaker of PFC is an iconic photograph that revealed a brave new science to the public [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>PFCs are inert compounds in which fluorine replaces hydrogen atoms. Water insolubility necessitates emulsification; egg yolk phospholipid was the emulsifying agent for the product used in phase III trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The plasma half-life of PFCs is approximately 12 hours. They were deemed stable for up to two years under refrigeration at approximately 4&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Unlike HBOCs, PFCs do not carry gases. Rather, because of their decreased surface tension and intramolecular action, they act as excellent solvents and have the capability of absorbing significant amounts of gases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/13,15,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,29</a>]. Their oxygen-carrying capacity is linearly related to the PO<sub>2</sub>; patients receiving these agents would require high concentrations of supplemental oxygen.</p><p>In 1989 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Fluosol, a PFC, for perfusion of ischemic tissues in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. This was the first such product ever licensed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Fluosol was withdrawn from the market in 1994 due to lack of commercial success. However, work on PFCs did not come to a halt. Results of a European phase III trial of perflubron emulsion in noncardiac patients suggested that, when used in conjunction with acute normovolemic hemodilution, this product resulted in slightly lower requirements for allogeneic blood compared with the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>A phase IIb trial of Oxycyte to improve oxygen delivery in traumatic brain injury was halted in 2014 due to enrollment difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Additional trials are not ongoing, and potential applications of PFC appear to be primarily diagnostic in nature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL USES FOR OCs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical areas for which OCs were originally considered to have the greatest potential were cardiovascular elective surgery and hemorrhagic shock related to trauma and acute blood loss.</p><p>OC will likely not be the product of choice for patients with long-term or chronic transfusion needs, due to their brief intravascular activity. As examples, patients with anemia of chronic disease, leukemia, or chemotherapy-induced anemia would not receive the prolonged oxygen-carrying benefit conferred by red blood cells, which have an average life span of 120 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the surgical setting, the goal of clinical trials has been to postpone, reduce, or eliminate the need for allogeneic blood, especially in cardiovascular procedures (including priming of the bypass pump) and situations in which bleeding could exceed anticipated levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/13,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,34</a>]. In some studies, patients who received hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) for cardiac, aortic, or emergency surgery required substantially fewer allogeneic red cell units compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15033255\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemorrhagic shock</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Animal experiments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because animal data suggested that the outcome of hemorrhagic shock correlated with tissue hypoxia, it was hypothesized that in humans, acellular, oxygen-carrying resuscitation fluids could improve outcomes related to hemorrhagic shock in settings of trauma or acute blood loss when blood was not immediately available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In preclinical studies, hemoglobin solutions and perfluorochemical compounds were used to resuscitate animals with severe hemorrhagic shock, and these compounds appeared to result in more rapid restoration of normal tissue metabolism and improved survival compared with crystalloid solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one protocol, 16 dogs were phlebotomized until hypotension, acidemia, and diminished mixed venous PO<sub>2</sub> occurred.

Patients who received the oxygen carrier had significantly higher mortality at 2 and 28 days (46 versus 17 percent at 28 days). The mechanism by which diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin might have worsened outcomes is unclear but may have been related to its actions as a nitric oxide scavenger <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its vasoconstrictive effects, which may have accelerated the rate of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

This concern was addressed in a phase III trial of PolyHeme, in which patient enrollment occurred under an FDA regulation (21CFRSection50.24) that provided an exemption from informed consent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Ethical considerations such as this will likely continue to inform the design of trials for trauma and patients who may not be able to provide informed consent prior to infusion.</p><p>Although adverse events and other challenges have reduced the availability of clinical trials involving OCs for trauma patients, several reports have suggested that OCs could potentially provide a benefit to another group of patients, those for whom blood is not an option (BNAO), especially as oxygen-bridging agents.

Furthermore, it is not known whether volunteer blood donors would support the raw materials needs of a commercial biotechnology enterprise.

These documents provide important insights into the philosophy and expectations of the FDA. The optimism in the early 2000s about near-term approval of OCs was dampened by the discontinuation of research into the use of cross-linked hemoglobin because a phase III trial of a diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin OC (HemAssist) showed a higher mortality rate in recipients of the OC versus controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion/abstract/19,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,98</a>] (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Human studies'</a> above).
