More precisely, it is a heterogeneous group of related disorders that share certain clinical and pathologic features. In the past, CRS lacked a clear definition and was approached differently by various specialties. However, multidisciplinary expert panels have been established to determine how these disorders should be defined, evaluated, and managed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>The definition, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, evaluation, and diagnosis of CRS will be discussed here. Treatment is presented separately. The complex role of microbes and antimicrobial therapy in CRS is reviewed elsewhere.

The diagnosis requires objective evidence of mucosal inflammation.</p><p>In some iterations of the definition, the phrase &quot;despite attempts at medical management&quot; is included to eliminate the possibility that CRS simply represents untreated acute rhinosinusitis. However, it is problematic to include this phrase, since there is no definitive standard of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p>Current definitions differ from earlier definitions of &quot;chronic sinusitis&quot; by adopting the term &quot;rhinosinusitis&quot; to emphasize the involvement of both the nasal passages and the paranasal sinuses, and by requiring objective evidence of sinus mucosal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1858543\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H410740955\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) worldwide vary significantly, in part because of differences in the diagnostic criteria used (eg, symptom-based diagnosis versus inclusion of objective rhinoscopy or imaging findings). In the United States, estimates ranged from 2 percent (based on International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9 diagnosis code) to 16 percent (based on the National Health Interview Survey) of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], while in various European countries the prevalence based on a postal survey ranges from 7 to 27 percent with an average of 10.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other estimates from South America and the Caribbean are in a similar range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>CRS occurs in both children and adults, although it is typically diagnosed in young or middle-aged adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In several studies of adults, the mean age at diagnosis was 39 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Women were disproportionately affected in some studies, although this finding is not consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3152809\"><span class=\"h2\">Economic burden</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRS is a chronic disorder with a considerable economic burden resulting from the costs of diagnostic tests, medical and surgical therapies, lost and reduced school and work productivity, and detrimental impact on physical and emotional health. Annual direct and indirect costs for CRS in the United States were estimated at USD $12.8 billion using data collected through 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3250712\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) may present abruptly, begin as a nonspecific upper respiratory infection (URI) or acute sinusitis that fails to resolve, or develop slowly and insidiously over months or years. Occasionally, the first manifestation of CRS may be a relatively acute presentation with severe headaches or facial pain or visual changes (such as diplopia). (See <a href=\"#H3255792\" class=\"local\">'Danger signs and complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3250739\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four cardinal <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of CRS in adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior nasal mucopurulent drainage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal <span class=\"nowrap\">obstruction/nasal</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">blockage/congestion</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial pain, pressure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fullness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction or loss of sense of smell</p><p/><p>In children, the fourth cardinal <span class=\"nowrap\">sign/symptom</span> is cough (rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">reduction/loss</span> of smell) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Except when noted, the material in this topic review is applicable to both adults and children.</p><p>Several other symptoms are reported by patients with CRS, including fatigue, malaise, cough, sleep disturbance, ear pain or pressure, dizziness, halitosis, dental pain, dysphonia, or nasal or throat irritation. However, none of these is specific enough to be clinically useful in diagnosis.</p><p>The four cardinal symptoms of CRS may be present with any subtype of disease and do not differentiate among the subtypes of CRS. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Features of specific subtypes'</a> below.)</p><p>Useful observations about the four leading <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior nasal mucopurulent drainage</strong> &ndash; The typical anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior nasal drainage of CRS is usually opaque white or light yellow. Thick yellow, green, or brown mucus can occur, although it is more characteristic of recurrent acute rhinosinusitis or allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute sinusitis and rhinosinusitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasal <span class=\"nowrap\">obstruction/nasal</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">blockage/congestion</strong></span> &ndash; Nasal congestion is often described by the patient as nasal blockage or stuffiness, or less commonly as nasal fullness. The differential diagnosis of nasal congestion includes allergic rhinitis, chronic nonallergic (idiopathic) rhinitis, rhinitis associated with medication use, and secondary atrophic rhinitis (ie, &quot;empty nose syndrome&quot;). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic nonallergic rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrophic-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrophic rhinosinusitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Congestion in CRS is bilateral, although patients may find congestion on one side to be more bothersome or noticeable than the other. However, truly unilateral nasal <span class=\"nowrap\">congestion/blockage</span> raises the question of a local anatomic problem or tumor, such as an antral choanal cyst. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-nasal-symptoms-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of nasal symptoms: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Facial pain, pressure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fullness</strong> &ndash; Facial pressure and headache are reported by most patients with CRS (83 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These symptoms may be seen in all subtypes of CRS, but they are less common in CRS with nasal polyps because the mucosal thickening in this condition is generally not associated with chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'CRS with nasal polyposis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Facial symptoms are common in patients with CRS, although they are the least specific of the cardinal symptoms. Facial pain can be caused by various nonrhinogenic conditions, including migraine headaches, tension headaches, cluster headaches, and other poorly understood facial pain syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, the presence of facial pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pressure is less reliable for predicting the presence of objective findings of rhinosinusitis compared with the symptoms of nasal obstruction or posterior nasal drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One study comprehensively examined the differential diagnosis of 211 patients presenting to the otolaryngologist for symptoms of sinus pressure, pain, or headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although 71 percent of patients met criteria for the presence of sinusitis or rhinologic disease and 56 percent were suspected to have CRS, nearly one-half (49 percent) of patients were also diagnosed as having a primary headache disorder. This study highlights the potential pitfalls in diagnosing CRS on the basis of symptoms of sinus pressure, pain, or headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mucosal linings of the paranasal sinuses are poorly innervated, which probably contributes to the nonspecific nature of facial pain in CRS. Most patients describe vague discomfort, fullness, or pressure in the cheeks above or below the eyes or across the bridge of the nose. Many patients point to an area on the face that anatomically localizes to the ostiomeatal complex on one or both sides (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67454 \">figure 1</a>). Obstruction of the nasofrontal recess may be associated with facial pain, pressure, or headache above the eyes or in the forehead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Focal and sharp facial pain over one or more sinus area(s) is less characteristic of CRS and is typically not associated with radiographic evidence of sinus disease. Evaluation of these sharp, localized pains usually does not identify a precise explanation, and the pains are often ultimately diagnosed as &quot;neurogenic&quot; or &quot;causalgic&quot; in nature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-craniofacial-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of craniofacial pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pain in the upper teeth is suggestive of nerve irritation caused by an inflammatory process adjacent to tooth roots. In patients with CRS, this symptom is typically intermittent and associated with an increase in other symptoms, such as nasal purulence. Dental pain was reported by 50 percent of patients in the series mentioned previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, in our experience, a much lower percentage of patients with CRS complain of tooth pain (eg, 5 to 10 percent). Even when this is reported, an &quot;odontogenic&quot; cause for the pain is not commonly found.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased sense of smell</strong> &ndash; Disturbance in sense of smell may be perceived as a reduced or completely absent sense of smell (hyposmia or anosmia, respectively). Anosmia is usually associated with mucosal thickening or opacification in the anterior ethmoid sinuses and is much more common in CRS with nasal polyposis than without polyposis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients with anosmia also frequently report a reduced ability to taste foods (ageusia).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3255792\"><span class=\"h2\">Danger signs and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following symptoms and signs are suggestive of other conditions or complications that require immediate evaluation: high fever, double or reduced vision, proptosis, dramatic periorbital edema, ophthalmoplegia, other focal neurologic signs, severe headache, meningeal signs, or significant or recurrent epistaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

One study documented that patients with CRS had significantly lower quality of life scores for social functioning as well as physical and overall health compared with the general population, with decrements similar to chronic lung or heart illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H22932626\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and associated conditions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FEATURES OF SPECIFIC SUBTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) can be divided into three distinct clinical syndromes. The characteristics of each are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53734 \">table 1</a>). Subtype distinctions are clinically relevant, since risk factors, contributing disorders, and response to medical or surgical management are substantively different among the three conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>].</p><p>The three subtypes of CRS are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRS with nasal polyposis (CRS with NP) &ndash; Accounting for 20 to 33 percent of cases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) &ndash; 8 to 12 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRS without nasal polyposis (CRS without NP) &ndash; 60 to 65 percent</p><p/><p>The pathophysiology of the different subtypes remains incompletely understood, although it is an area of intense multidisciplinary study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,26</a>]. Data on the pathophysiology of each subtype is discussed in this section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">CRS with nasal polyposis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRS with NP) is characterized by the presence of bilateral nasal polyps in the middle meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nasal polyps are translucent, yellowish-gray to white, glistening masses filled with gelatinous inflammatory material, which may form in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50105 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53872\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53872 \">picture 2</a>). The gray-white color is due to the relatively avascular nature of the polyp tissue. One to 4 percent of the general population has nasal polyps and most are believed to be symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4984464\"><span class=\"h3\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic presentation of CRS with NP is gradually worsening nasal <span class=\"nowrap\">congestion/obstruction,</span> sinus fullness and pressure, fatigue, posterior nasal drainage, and hyposmia or anosmia. In contrast, fever and severe facial pain are uncommon.</p><p>On physical examination, large polyps are often visible with anterior rhinoscopy, while smaller polyps require nasal endoscopy or imaging. Nasal polyps lack sensation. Swollen nasal turbinates are sometimes mistaken for nasal polyps, but turbinates are pink in color, similar in appearance to the rest of the nasal mucosa, and very sensitive to touch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F52743\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52743 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Nasal polyps generally begin to form around the ostiomeatal complex, although they may eventually be found throughout the nasal cavities and sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The initial trigger for their development is probably variable. Nasal polyposis in CRS with NP should be bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Unilateral polyps are relatively uncommon. If confirmed by imaging of the sinuses, this finding should prompt consideration of other diagnoses, including inverting papilloma or nasal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-nasal-symptoms-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of nasal symptoms: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CRS with NP affects immunocompetent patients and is associated with asthma and adverse reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). Reactions involve some combination of rhinitis, conjunctival irritation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asthmatic symptoms occurring within one to four hours after ingestion of a COX-1-inhibiting NSAID. The combination of asthma, CRS with NP, and aspirin sensitivity is called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Other terms for this combination of disorders include &quot;triad asthma&quot; or &quot;Samter's syndrome.&quot; Among patients with CRS with NP, between 30 and 40 percent report wheezing and respiratory discomfort and about 15 percent have aspirin-associated respiratory disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53734 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and management of AERD is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20818307\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On imaging with computerized tomography (CT), mucosal thickening is characteristically marked and bilateral. The CT density of polyps is similar to that of thickened mucosa, although polyps are differentiated from nonpolypoid mucosal thickening by their shape and contours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57710\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57710 \">image 1</a>). Polyps appear as rounded mucosal protrusions into the nasal or sinus cavities.</p><p>Sinus opacification in the absence of facial <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/pressure/headaches</span> is typical of patients with CRS with NP and is unlikely to represent chronic bacterial infection. When multiple polyps are present, sinus secretions may become entrapped within the crevices between the polyps. The CT attenuation values of the secretions can increase, and the polyp tissue itself might show mixed CT attenuation values with areas of increased density, simulating focal or diffuse dystrophic calcifications. When further information is required to clarify the nature of the findings, the combination of sinus CT plus sinus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Mixed infiltrates of mononuclear cells and eosinophils are usually present, with a predominancy of eosinophils.

An increase in epithelial goblet cells may also be present, although this does not distinguish CRS with NP from CRS without NP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4984597\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyp tissue typically contains high levels of the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), and high levels of histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>There is evidence for localized allergic hyperresponsiveness to colonizing Staphylococcus aureus in particular, as evidenced by the local production of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against staphylococcal enterotoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].

Anti-enterotoxin antibodies can be measured in sinus tissues from patients with CRS with NP, although levels in the blood may be undetectable.

Patients with AFRS are immunocompetent and show evidence of allergy to one or more fungi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53734 \">table 1</a>). AFRS typically presents subtly over years, with symptoms similar to CRS with NP, since these patients usually have NP. Fever is uncommon. In occasional patients, AFRS presents dramatically with complete nasal obstruction, gross facial asymmetry, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visual changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Such patients may have persistent symptoms between episodes, in which case they could be classified as CRS without NP. However, they may be completely symptom-free between episodes in which case they have been described as having &quot;recurrent acute rhinosinusitis&quot; or &quot;chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>CRS without NP is heterogeneous and may include patients with allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, structural abnormalities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunodeficiency.

The contribution of chronic infection at this point is variable and controversial (see <a href=\"#H2065981560\" class=\"local\">'Role of bacterial infection'</a> below). In some cases, there is little clinical evidence of infection. However, studies have demonstrated the presence of bacterial biofilm in sinus tissue in 45 to 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>].</p><p>Histopathologic analysis typically reveals chronic inflammation with variable numbers of mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and some eosinophils (typically much fewer than seen in CRS with NP), and bacterial colonization or biofilm may contribute to the chronic inflammatory process.

A few studies have addressed incidental findings and concluded that these are not uncommon and should not warrant treatment unless there are suggestive symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells of 147 children who had undergone MRI of the head for reasons other than sinusitis or mastoiditis was evaluated in a prospective analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Mucosal swelling in the maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses was characterized as absent, minor (&lt;5 mm), or major (&ge;5 mm). Involvement of the ethmoid cells and mastoid cells was characterized as absent, minor (&le;50 percent of cells) or major (&gt;50 percent). On MRI, 61 percent of children had one or more findings in their paranasal sinuses or mastoid cells, including 48 percent with mucosal swelling in their paranasal cavities and 25 percent with abnormalities in the mastoid cells. The prevalence was higher among children younger than 10 years of age (60 percent in paranasal sinuses and 42 percent in mastoid cells) and among children with current upper respiratory tract infection (71 percent and 35 percent). No correlation was found with a history of headache, snoring, asthma, allergies, gender, or place of residence. The authors concluded that mucosal swelling in the paranasal sinuses and mastoids is a frequent incidental finding in children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence and clinical relevance of findings of chronic sinusitis on head CT scans was evaluated in a retrospective study of 500 adults presenting to an emergency department with acute atraumatic headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. In this study, findings of &quot;chronic sinusitis&quot; were defined as CT findings of mucosal thickening, secretions, or opacification involving the ethmoid, frontal, or maxillary sinuses. CT scans showing polyps, polypoid thickening, or mucous retention cysts were considered indeterminate, whereas CT scans reporting an air-fluid level were considered possibly consistent with acute sinusitis (a potential etiology for an acute atraumatic headache). A cohort of 234 patients with atraumatic headache was compared with a control cohort of 266 patients with minor head injury. Findings of chronic sinusitis (total of 19.8 percent of CT scans), indeterminate (total of 4.4 percent of CT scans), or air-fluid level (total of 4.0 percent of CT scans) were no more prevalent in the atraumatic headache group than in the minor head injury group. The authors concluded that the various CT findings of chronic sinusitis in patients with atraumatic headache may be incidental and that these findings are rarely the cause of a patient's acute headache.</p><p/><p>Based on these studies, it can be concluded that radiographic abnormalities in the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells are not uncommon in asymptomatic patients. The clinician who encounters patients with asymptomatic findings should consider whether the findings may relate to a recent viral upper respiratory infection (URI). If so, treatment is not warranted. In the absence of a recent URI, the patient should be questioned further about symptoms suggestive of chronic sinusitis (or mastoiditis). If symptoms are not present, treatment is not indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3211989758\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The four cardinal symptoms of CRS are mucopurulent drainage, nasal obstruction, facial pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pressure, and decreased olfaction. At least two of these four must be present to consider the diagnosis of CRS. These symptoms are not specific for CRS, do not distinguish reliably among the different subtypes, and do not correlate well with objective findings upon imaging. (See <a href=\"#H3250712\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRS may be subdivided into three distinct clinical syndromes, with different contributing factors and responses to medical or surgical management: CRS with nasal polyposis (CRS with NP), CRS without nasal polyposis (CRS without NP), and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53734 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Features of specific subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRS, particularly CRS with NP, is strongly associated with asthma and with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). A variety of factors may contribute to the development of CRS, independent of the subtype, including environmental allergies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> sensitivity, inhaled irritants, viral infections, immunodeficiency, systemic diseases, and anatomic abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74779\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74779 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22932626\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of CRS involves a clinical history and objective documentation of mucosal disease with either sinus CT imaging, or rhinoscopy or nasal endoscopy with decongestion. Allergy evaluation should be pursued in all patients, and immunologic defects and infectious complications should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CRS requires the presence of at least two of the four cardinal symptoms of CRS lasting 12 weeks or longer, despite attempts at medical management PLUS objective evidence of sinus mucosal disease on sinus CT imaging or direct examination. Each subtype of CRS has characteristic findings on CT imaging. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of CRS includes headache and facial pain syndromes, various forms of rhinitis without sinusitis, laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), and disorders of olfaction.
