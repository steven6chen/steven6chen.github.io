Breast carcinomas are a diverse group of lesions that differ in microscopic appearance and biologic behavior, although these disorders are often discussed as a single disease.</p><p>The in situ carcinomas of the breast are either ductal (also known as intraductal carcinoma) or lobular. This distinction is primarily based upon the growth pattern and cytologic features of the lesions, rather than their anatomic location within the mammary ductal-lobular system. </p><p>The invasive breast carcinomas consist of several histologic subtypes; the estimated percentages are from a contemporary population-based series of 135,157 women with breast cancer reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute between 1992 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltrating ductal &ndash; 76 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive lobular &ndash; 8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Ductal/lobular</span> &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucinous (colloid) &ndash; 2.4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubular &ndash; 1.5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medullary &ndash; 1.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papillary &ndash; 1 percent</p><p/><p>Other subtypes, including metaplastic breast cancer and invasive micropapillary breast cancer, all account for less than 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the histology of ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast carcinoma.

DCIS is characterized by proliferation of presumably malignant epithelial cells within the mammary ductal system, with no evidence of invasion into the surrounding stroma on routine light microscopic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ductal carcinoma in situ differs from lobular carcinoma in situ with regard to radiologic features, morphology, biologic behavior, and anatomic distribution in the breast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72750\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72750 \">table 1</a>). Lobular carcinoma in situ is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atypia-and-lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-high-risk-lesions-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atypia and lobular carcinoma in situ: High-risk lesions of the breast&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Classification schemes that divide DCIS histologically into a variety of subtypes emphasize architectural features or growth pattern of the neoplastic cells, cytologic features, and cell necrosis, both singly and in combination. The traditional method for classifying DCIS lesions is primarily based upon the growth pattern (architectural features) of the tumor and recognizes five major types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The comedo type is characterized by prominent necrosis in the center of the involved spaces. The necrotic material frequently becomes calcified; the calcifications may be detected mammographically, characteristically as linear, branching (&quot;casting&quot;) calcifications. The tumor cells are large and show nuclear pleomorphism; mitotic activity may be prominent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77048\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77048 \">picture 1</a>). The comedo type is more often associated with invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], and the degree of comedo necrosis in patients with DCIS appears to be a strong predictor for the risk of ipsilateral breast recurrence after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cribriform type is characterized by the formation of back to back glands without intervening stroma. The cells comprising this subtype are typically small to medium sized and have relatively uniform hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitoses are infrequent, and necrosis is limited to single cells or small cell clusters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71553\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71553 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The micropapillary type features small tufts of cells that are oriented perpendicular to the basement membrane of the involved spaces and project into the lumina. The apical region of these small papillations is frequently broader than the base, imparting a club-shaped appearance. The micropapillae lack fibrovascular cores. The cells comprising this type of DCIS are usually small to medium in size, and the nuclei show diffuse hyperchromasia; mitoses are infrequent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58302\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58302 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The papillary type shows intraluminal projections of tumor cells that, in contrast to the micropapillary variant, demonstrate fibrovascular cores and thereby constitute true papillations. A variant of papillary DCIS, intracystic papillary carcinoma, is characterized by tumor cells that are primarily or exclusively present in a single cystically dilated space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The solid type is not as well defined as the other subtypes. It features tumor cells that fill and distend the involved spaces and lack significant necrosis, fenestrations, or papillations. The tumor cells may be large, medium, or small.</p><p/><p>Less common variants of DCIS include the &quot;clinging&quot; carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], intraductal signet ring cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and cystic hypersecretory duct carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Similar to the comedo type, these variants may show calcifications that can be detected mammographically. However, the mammographic appearance of these microcalcifications is less distinctive than the pattern seen in comedo lesions and can resemble a number of benign processes.</p><p>A number of authors have proposed alternative classification systems for DCIS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67963 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Although they use different terminology, all are primarily based upon nuclear grade <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence or absence of necrosis, and have in common the recognition of three main categories of DCIS (ie, high, intermediate, and low grade).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade lesions typically exhibit aneuploidy, lack estrogen and progesterone receptors, and have a high proliferative rate, overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene, mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene with accumulation of its protein product, and angiogenesis in the surrounding stroma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade lesions are typically diploid, estrogen- and progesterone receptor-positive, have a low proliferative rate, and rarely (if ever) show abnormalities of the <span class=\"nowrap\">HER2/neu</span> or p53 oncogenes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions categorized histologically as intermediate grade are also intermediate between the high-grade and low-grade lesions with regard to the frequency of alterations in these biological markers.</p><p/><p>These classification systems appear to correlate with biologic prognostic markers and predict groups of patients who are likely to have a recurrence of cancer following breast conservation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/15,18-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18-30</a>].

Although the panel did not endorse any single classification system, they recommended that certain features be routinely documented in the pathology report for DCIS lesions, including nuclear grade, the presence of necrosis, cell polarization, and architectural pattern(s).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most common type of invasive breast cancer, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of invasive lesions. It is also termed infiltrating carcinoma of no special type or infiltrating carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS).</p><p>On gross pathologic evaluation, these lesions are typically hard, gray-white, gritty masses that invade the surrounding tissue in a haphazard fashion to create the characteristic irregular, stellate shape. They are characterized microscopically by cords and nests of tumor cells with varying amounts of gland formation, and cytologic features that range from bland to highly malignant. The malignant cells induce a fibrous response as they infiltrate the breast parenchyma, and this reaction is, in large part, responsible for the clinically and grossly palpable mass, the radiologic density, and solid sonographic characteristics of typical invasive carcinomas.</p><p>Infiltrating ductal carcinomas are divided into three grades based upon a combination of architectural and cytologic features, usually assessed utilizing a scoring system based on three parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-differentiated (grade 1) &ndash; Well-differentiated tumors have cells that infiltrate the stroma as solid nests of glands.

There is some nuclear pleomorphism and a moderate mitotic rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55284\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55284 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorly differentiated (grade 3) &ndash; Poorly differentiated tumors are composed of solid nests of neoplastic cells without evidence of gland formation. There is marked nuclear atypia and considerable mitotic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67082\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67082 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p/><p>A variable amount of associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is present in most cases; the extent of DCIS but not lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is an important prognostic factor in patients treated with breast conserving therapy in whom the surgical goal is complete excision of both intraductal and invasive carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INFILTRATING LOBULAR CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infiltrating lobular carcinomas are the second most common type of invasive breast cancer, accounting for about 5 to 10 percent of invasive lesions.</p><p>Incidence rates of lobular cancer are rising faster than the rates of ductal carcinoma in the United States, and postmenopausal hormone therapy may be more strongly related to lobular cancer risk than to ductal cancer risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-the-risk-of-breast-cancer#H150020086\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Prognosis and tumor characteristics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some infiltrating lobular carcinomas have a macroscopic appearance identical to that of infiltrating ductal cancers. However, in many cases no mass lesion is grossly evident, and the excised breast tissue may have a normal or only slightly firm consistency. Thus, the microscopic size of invasive lobular carcinoma may be significantly greater than that measured grossly. Some pathologists have used lack of immunohistochemical staining for E-cadherin to distinguish invasive lobular carcinoma from invasive duct carcinoma. While it appears to be a reasonably accurate test, it is for the most part unnecessary in practice.</p><p>These tumors are characterized microscopically by small cells that insidiously infiltrate the mammary stroma and adipose tissue individually and in a single file pattern, often growing in a target-like configuration around normal breast ducts, frequently inducing only minimal fibrous reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54150\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54150 \">picture 7</a>). Associated lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is present in approximately two-thirds of cases; however, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may also accompany invasive lobular carcinoma.</p><p>In addition to their different histologic appearance and mammographic characteristics, there are distinct prognostic and biologic differences between infiltrating lobular and ductal cancers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltrating lobular carcinomas have a higher frequency of bilaterality and multicentricity than infiltrating ductal carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltrating lobular carcinomas arise in older women and are larger and better differentiated tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36</a>]. As a rule, invasive lobular carcinomas are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, with variant lesions showing occasional variable expression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While older series report a similar prognosis for infiltrating lobular cancers and invasive ductal lesions, subsequent reports suggest that outcomes (at least in the short-term) may be more favorable for lobular cancers and improving over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, variants of infiltrating lobular carcinoma exist, some of which have a poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a group, invasive lobular carcinomas tend to metastasize later than invasive duct carcinomas and spread to unusual locations such as the peritoneum, meninges, and gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p>There is an association between mutations in the cadherin (<em>CDH1</em>) gene and invasive lobular breast cancers.

However, germline <em>CDH1</em> mutations can also be cosegregated with invasive lobular breast cancer in the absence of diffuse gastric cancer, suggesting that gastric cancer is not an obligatory hallmark of families with <em>CDH1</em> mutations.

Some studies suggest that tumors in which the squamous cell component predominates (more than 90 percent of the malignant cells are of squamous type) are more aggressive and frequently treatment-refractory when compared with other infiltrating ductal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-breast-cancer/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].
