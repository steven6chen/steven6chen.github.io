However, blood volume studies are not practical for this purpose, cost-effective, or generally available. As a result, anemia has been defined as a reduction in one or more of the major red blood cell (RBC) measurements obtained as a part of the complete blood count (CBC): hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit (HCT), or RBC count. In practice, however, a low hemoglobin concentration or a low hematocrit is most widely employed for this purpose.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin</strong> &ndash; Hemoglobin concentration is the concentration of hemoglobin, the major oxygen-carrying molecule in whole blood. Values may be expressed as grams of hemoglobin per 100 mL of whole blood <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/dL)</span> or per liter of blood <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/L)</span>. Efforts are underway to determine hemoglobin levels non-invasively, allowing continuous monitoring of this parameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematocrit</strong> &ndash; Hematocrit (HCT), also called packed cell volume, is the packed spun volume of blood that consists of intact RBCs, expressed as a percentage.

On the other hand, some ranges are &quot;one-tailed,&quot; such that 5 percent of normal subjects will have levels below the stated lower limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal range for hemoglobin and HCT is so wide that, for example, a male patient with a baseline HCT of 49 percent may lose up to 15 percent of his RBC mass and still have a HCT within the normal range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting a lower limit of normal for hemoglobin does not imply that such levels are &quot;optimal&quot; in terms of morbidity and mortality. One study has suggested that the lower limits of an optimal hemoglobin level, as assessed by all-cause mortality data, are 13.0 and 14.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for older adult women and men, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in one report, older black subjects classified as anemic by WHO criteria did not appear to be at risk for adverse events such as mortality and mobility disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], suggesting that alternative criteria for anemia might be required for this group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79757\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79757 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Evaluation of these values is an integral part of determining the cause of anemia. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Morphologic approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MCV</strong> &ndash; Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is the average volume (size) of the patient's RBCs. It can be measured or calculated (MCV in femtoliters [fL] = 10 x HCT [in percent] &divide; RBC [in <span class=\"nowrap\">millions/microL])</span>. Anemia can be classified based on whether the MCV is low, normal, or elevated. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Morphologic approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MCH</strong> &ndash; Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is the average hemoglobin content in a RBC. It is calculated (MCH in picograms <span class=\"nowrap\">[pg]/cell</span> = hemoglobin [in <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL]</span> x 10 &divide; RBC [in <span class=\"nowrap\">millions/microL]</span>. A low MCH indicates decreased hemoglobin content per cell, and is typically reflected in hypochromia on the peripheral blood smear. This may be seen in iron deficiency and hemoglobinopathies like the thalassemias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MCHC</strong> &ndash; Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is the average hemoglobin concentration per RBC. It is calculated as (MCHC in grams <span class=\"nowrap\">[g]/dL</span> = hemoglobin [in <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL]</span> X 100 &divide; HCT [in percent]). Very low MCHC values are typical of iron deficiency anemia, and very high MCHC values typically reflect spherocytosis or RBC agglutination. Examination of the peripheral blood smear is helpful in distinguishing these findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-peripheral-blood-smear#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear&quot;, section on 'Red blood cells'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RDW</strong> &ndash; Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the variation in RBC size, which is reflected in the degree of anisocytosis on the peripheral blood smear. A high RDW implies a large variation in RBC sizes, and a low RDW implies a more homogeneous population of RBCs. RDW is calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV) of the red cell volume distribution (RDW = [standard <span class=\"nowrap\">deviation/MCV]</span> x 100). A high RDW can be seen in a number of anemias, including iron deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hemoglobinopathies, as well as in patients with anemia who have received transfusions. Review of the peripheral blood smear often is helpful in identifying the cause of large variations in RBC size.

EPO is a true endocrine hormone produced in the kidney by cells that sense the adequacy of tissue oxygenation relative to the individual's metabolic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53916\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53916 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>EPO enhances the growth and differentiation of the two erythroid progenitors: burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) into normoblasts of increasing maturity. The most mature of these, the orthochromatic normoblast, extrudes its nucleus to form a red blood cell (RBC) via mechanisms that are still unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. As such, the enucleate red blood cell still has a ribosomal network that, when stained supravitally, identifies it as a reticulocyte, a cell still capable of a limited amount of hemoglobin and protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The reticulocyte retains its ribosomal network (and its staining characteristics) for approximately four days, of which three days are generally spent in the bone marrow and one day in the peripheral blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61552\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61552 \">figure 2</a>). The resulting mature RBC circulates for 110 to 120 days, after which time it is removed from the circulation by macrophages that detect senescent signals, primarily on the RBC membrane, through mechanisms that are poorly understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Under steady state conditions, the rate of RBC production equals the rate of RBC loss. Assuming, for ease of calculation, a survival of mature RBC of 100 days, 1 percent of RBCs will be removed from the circulation each day. To achieve a constant RBC mass, RBC losses must be replaced with an equal number of reticulocytes during the same time period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reticulocytes normally survive in the circulation for one day; after this time they lose their reticulum (RNA) and become mature red blood cells. Under steady-state conditions reticulocytes will represent approximately 1 percent of total circulating RBC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64238\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64238 \">table 1</a>). Since the normal RBC count is approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">million/microL</span> (5.0 x 10<sup>12</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/liter),</span> the bone marrow must produce approximately 50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">reticulocytes/microL</span> (5 x 10<sup>10</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/liter)</span> of whole blood each day in order to achieve a stable RBC mass. Lesser rates of RBC production, if persistent, lead to anemia.</p><p/><p>The rate of red cell production increases markedly under the influence of high levels of EPO. A normal bone marrow replete with iron, folate, and cobalamin can increase erythropoiesis in response to EPO approximately fivefold in adults and seven- to eightfold in children. Thus, under optimal conditions, steady-state absolute reticulocyte counts as high as <span class=\"nowrap\">350,000/microL</span> (3.5 x 10<sup>11</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/liter)</span> are possible in the adult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Reticulocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reticulocytes can be enumerated manually after supravital staining of a blood sample with dyes such as new <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74294\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74294 \">picture 3</a>).

Over the ensuing 36 to 48 hours, most of the total blood volume deficit will be repaired by the movement of fluid from the extravascular into the intravascular space. Only at these later times will the hemoglobin and HCT reflect blood loss. Accordingly, if the total blood volume deficit is not fully repaired and the patient remains hypovolemic, the hemoglobin and HCT will underestimate the degree of blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late pregnancy</strong> &ndash; In the third trimester of pregnancy the RBC mass and plasma volume are expanded by 25 and 50 percent, respectively, resulting in reductions in hemoglobin, HCT, and RBC count, often to anemic levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62723\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62723 \">figure 3</a>).

Symptoms are much less likely with anemia that evolves slowly because there is time for multiple homeostatic forces to adjust to a reduced oxygen carrying capacity of blood.</p><p>Symptoms related to anemia can result from two factors: decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and, in patients with acute and marked bleeding, the added insult of hypovolemia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased oxygen delivery</strong> &ndash; Red blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen linked to hemoglobin from the lungs to tissue capillaries. Oxygen is then released from hemoglobin according to the characteristics of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, with each gram of hemoglobin capable of carrying 1.3 mL of oxygen. Thus, approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/dL</span> (or 20 volumes percent) can be carried by 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> of hemoglobin at full saturation. Approximately 5 volumes percent (25 percent of the total) is normally removed by the tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The extraction of oxygen by the tissues can increase from a baseline of 25 percent to a maximum of approximately 60 percent in the presence of anemia or hypoperfusion. Thus, normal oxygen delivery of 5 volumes percent can be maintained by enhanced extraction alone down to a hemoglobin concentration of 8 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symptoms will occur when the hemoglobin concentration falls below this level at rest, at higher hemoglobin concentrations during exertion, or when cardiac compensation is impaired because of underlying heart disease. The primary symptoms include exertional dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, varying degrees of fatigue, and signs and symptoms of the hyperdynamic state such as bounding pulses, palpitations, and a roaring pulsatile sound in the ears. More severe anemia may lead to lethargy, confusion, and potentially life-threatening complications such as congestive failure, angina, arrhythmia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myocardial infarction.

The earliest symptoms include easy fatigability, lassitude, and muscle cramps. This can progress to postural dizziness, lethargy, syncope, and, in severe cases, persistent hypotension, shock, and death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is some reduction in blood volume but not plasma volume after acute severe hemolysis, due to the fall in RBC mass. In comparison, total blood volume remains normal in anemia due to chronic, low-grade bleeding since there is ample time for a compensatory increase in the plasma volume via equilibration with the extravascular space and renal retention of salt and water.</p><p/><p>Although anemia (with or without volume depletion) may be associated with fatigue, this complaint is nonspecific, may be present in a number of other conditions, and may be multifactorial.

This effect was modest and only reached statistical significance at hematocrits &le;25 percent (odds ratio [OR] 1.29; 95% CI 1.11-1.49).

Occasional patients may have two (or all three) of these mechanisms operating at the same time. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (ie, increased RBC destruction) can have a low reticulocyte response (ie, decreased RBC production) as the result of concomitant bone marrow suppression.

Thus, a reduced or absent reticulocyte response for the degree of anemia indicates reduced red cell production. A convenient way to evaluate this is via the <strong>reticulocyte production index</strong> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-reticulocyte-production-index-rpi-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), which will be low (&lt;2) when the marrow response to anemia is inadequate for the degree of anemia and increased (&gt;3) when the marrow is responding normally to the anemia.

Examination of the blood smear is important in order to determine if there is a small population of red cells with distinctive size or shape abnormalities which would place the patient in one of the above categories (ie, early microcytic or macrocytic anemia), or would raise suspicion of an acute or chronic hemolytic state (eg, spherocytes, sickle forms, ovalocytes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Hemolysis may have been suspected from the patient's history, physical examination, or examination of the peripheral blood smear (eg, sudden onset of anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, presence of spherocytes or schistocytes or other red cell shape changes) (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the patient'</a> above). It is confirmed by the finding of increased levels of indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, and low levels of haptoglobin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72394 \">table 4</a>).

Consultation with a hematologist would be appropriate at this point.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Anemia may be the first manifestation of a systemic disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53867\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53867 \">table 5</a>), along with other nonspecific complaints such as fever, weight loss, anorexia, and malaise. Simple laboratory tests may give additional clues toward the underlying disease process.
