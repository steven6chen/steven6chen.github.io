In a retrospective cohort review of 205 consecutive patients presenting with DCIS, 51 (24.9 percent) patients had microinvasion identified upon histologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, microinvasive breast carcinoma remains an uncommon disease, estimated as accounting for less than 1 percent of all breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. As with invasive breast cancer, microinvasive breast carcinoma is predominantly ductal in histologic type.</p><p>Risk factors for microinvasive breast carcinoma appear to be similar to those associated with DCIS, such as nulliparity and family history of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It occurs over a wide age range (30 to 85 years of age), with the average age in the 50 to 60s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Case series have also suggested that patients diagnosed with microinvasive breast carcinoma have a high incidence of other high-risk lesions, including concurrent breast carcinoma and other malignancies, present at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology of DCIS is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564860001\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition, pathology, and staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microinvasive breast carcinoma is defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control (AJCC-UICC) as invasive carcinoma of the breast with no focus measuring more than 1 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is almost always encountered in the setting of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), where small foci of tumor cells have invaded through the basement membrane into the surrounding stroma. It is rarely seen in association with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or in the absence of carcinoma in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Where associated with LCIS, the microinvasive component is usually lobular or occasionally tubular in histologic type.</p><p>According to the eighth edition Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis (TNM) staging system, as well as the preceding seventh edition, microinvasive breast carcinoma is designated as T1mi, as presented in the respective tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65393\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65393 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In cases with multiple foci of microinvasion (where no focus is larger than 1 mm), the number of foci and range of sizes should be reported. Note that the sizes of individual foci of microinvasion are not added together. Since microinvasive breast carcinoma is more likely to present with multiple foci of invasion, the pathologic specimen should be carefully examined for additional foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Histopathologically, microinvasive breast carcinoma tends to be associated with high-grade DCIS and comedo type necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/2,3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,7</a>]. There is also evidence that the risk of microinvasion increases with larger size DCIS lesions and multicentric DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is little information about biological markers such as estrogen and progesterone status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression in microinvasive breast carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a study including 30 patients who had complete hormone receptor testing of both the invasive and in situ components, <span class=\"nowrap\">ER/PR-positivity</span> was 100 percent concordant in both microinvasive and in situ disease; ER-negativity was 83 percent concordant. HER2 status was 100 percent concordant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Contrary to invasive breast cancer, the limited data suggest that receptor expression has little prognostic significance in microinvasive breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H564860043\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564860008\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to DCIS, which is most often diagnosed due to abnormal mammographic findings, microinvasive breast carcinoma more commonly presents as a palpable mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. The mass usually represents an area of DCIS with stromal desmoplasia; the microinvasion in and of itself is not palpable. Nipple discharge may also occur. </p><p>Some studies suggest that the most frequent imaging appearance of microinvasive breast carcinoma is a mass, with or without calcifications, again likely as a function of large areas of DCIS with stromal reaction rather than as a function of the microinvasion itself, whereas others have found that similar to DCIS, the most frequent imaging appearance is calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These different results are likely due to differences between studies in the definition of microinvasive breast carcinoma used, which imaging studies were performed (ie, mammography or ultrasonography), and degree of tissue sampling. For example, a retrospective review of 37 patients with microinvasive breast cancer and 44 patients with intraductal carcinoma found that the most dominant MRI findings of both lesions was heterogenous enhancement of non-mass-like lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The additional dominant MRI characteristics for patients with microinvasive breast cancer included segmental distribution, clustered ring enhancement of the non-mass lesion, enhancement kinetics demonstrating strong initial enhancement with subsequent wash-out.</p><p>Most diagnostic biopsies are performed as core needle biopsies. As such, pathology results may only reveal DCIS or DCIS with a focus &quot;suspicious for&quot; microinvasion. It is only when the entire lesion is removed that a complete evaluation can be performed and a final diagnosis of microinvasive breast carcinoma can be rendered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564860015\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that BCS followed by RT is a reasonable treatment approach for most patients with microinvasive breast carcinoma. However, mastectomy may be preferred for patients in whom the DCIS component is large, high-grade, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> comedo type <strong>and</strong> in whom clean margins cannot be definitively obtained with BCS. </p><p>Although simple mastectomy achieves an excellent &quot;cure&quot; rate for microinvasive breast carcinoma, it likely provides overly aggressive treatment for many women. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) may be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence; radiation therapy (RT) after BCS minimizes this risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564860022\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of the breast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials to inform the optimal surgical treatment for microinvasive breast carcinoma. As with invasive cancer and pure DCIS, BCS followed by RT to the whole breast (together referred to as breast conserving therapy, BCT) is the most common approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductal carcinoma in situ: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastectomy: Indications, types, and concurrent axillary lymph node management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with DCIS and early invasive breast cancer, BCT for microinvasive breast carcinoma appears to achieve excellent outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. In a retrospective study of 321 patients with DCIS and 72 patients with microinvasion treated with BCT, the presence of microinvasion did not correlate with local recurrence rate, distant relapse free survival, or overall survival at almost nine years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The improved outcomes in contemporary series may be due at least in part to the use of adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients whose disease is estrogen receptor (ER)-positive. </p><p>The risk of recurrence following BCT for microinvasive disease appears to be increased with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive excision margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>] (See <a href=\"#H564860043\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size of the DCIS component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unfavorable histopathologic characteristics of the associated DCIS component, ie, comedo subtype and high nuclear grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microinvasive-breast-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p>As described above, these characteristics are common with microinvasive breast carcinoma.
