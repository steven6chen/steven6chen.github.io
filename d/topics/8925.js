In women with acute preterm labor, a 2009 meta-analysis of randomized trials found that these drugs were more effective than <span class=\"nowrap\">placebo/control</span> for delaying delivery for 48 hours (75 to 93 percent versus 53 percent for <span class=\"nowrap\">placebo/control)</span> and for seven days (61 to 78 percent versus 39 percent for <span class=\"nowrap\">placebo/control),</span> but not for delaying delivery to 37 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Notably in this meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], a substantial proportion of women diagnosed with preterm labor (about 50 percent) did not deliver in the short-term, or even preterm, when tocolytic therapy was not administered. Furthermore, administration of tocolytic drugs did not result in statistically significant reductions in important clinical outcomes, such as neonatal respiratory distress and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1657417355\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women in the early phases of acute preterm labor, when cervical dilation is not advanced, are optimum candidates for tocolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Tocolysis is indicated when the overall benefits of delaying delivery outweigh the risks. In a practice bulletin, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opined: &quot;Interventions to reduce the likelihood of delivery should be reserved for women with preterm labor at a gestational age at which a delay in delivery will provide benefit to the newborn. Because tocolytic therapy is generally effective for up to 48 hours, only women with fetuses that would benefit from a 48 hour delay in delivery should receive tocolytic treatment&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Inhibition of acute preterm labor is less likely to be successful as labor advances to the point that cervical dilation is greater than 3 cm. Tocolysis can still be effective in these cases, especially when the goal is to administer antenatal corticosteroids or safely transport the mother to a tertiary care center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].

The authors would give tocolytics to a woman less than 22 weeks of gestation if she has a self-limited condition that could cause an acute episode of preterm labor but is unlikely to cause recurrent preterm labor. As an example, we would attempt to inhibit contractions related to an appendectomy or acute pyelonephritis at 20 weeks of gestation in the absence of maternal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"> In the United States, a workshop comprised of obstetric and pediatric experts suggested 22<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</sup></span> weeks as the lower limit for consideration of tocolysis if antenatal steroids were concurrently administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], given this gestational age is at the limit of viability and corticosteroid effectiveness.

The value of this approach has not been studied in a randomized trial. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1277601\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women at 24 to 32 weeks of gestation who are candidates for tocolysis, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> for first-line therapy. Data from randomized trials suggest it is superior to placebo and has a favorable maternal and fetal side effect profile at this gestational age. We do not use indomethacin for more than 72 hours because of concern about premature constriction of the ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> as a first-line agent for women who have a contraindication to indomethacin therapy (maternal platelet dysfunction or bleeding disorder, hepatic dysfunction, gastrointestinal ulcerative disease, renal dysfunction, or asthma [in women with hypersensitivity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>]). (See <a href=\"#H1279823\" class=\"local\">'Cyclooxygenase inhibitors'</a> below.) <br/><br/>For women at 32 to 34 weeks of gestation, we use nifedipine for first-line therapy, given the potential for adverse fetal effects with use of indomethacin at this gestational age. (See <a href=\"#H1279823\" class=\"local\">'Cyclooxygenase inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>If the first-line drug does not inhibit contractions, we discontinue it and begin therapy with another agent. For second-line therapy, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> at 24 to 32 weeks and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> at 32 to 34 weeks and for patients at 24 to 32 weeks who received nifedipine as a first-line agent. We avoid concurrent use of tocolytic drugs because of the increased risk of side effects and the absence of evidence of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, we selectively use combinations of tocolytics in very early gestations; the decision is made on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>We discontinue tocolytics 48 hours after administration of the first corticosteroid dose. </p><p>There is no consensus as to whether women in acute preterm labor should be evaluated routinely for infection or the appropriate tests for diagnosis of subclinical infection. We obtain amniotic fluid via amniocentesis for gram stain and glucose level before beginning a second tocolytic agent or when the patient is afebrile, but has nonspecific laboratory or physical findings suggestive of infection, such as leukocytosis, unexplained maternal or fetal tachycardia, or uterine tenderness. We culture the fluid for aerobes, anaerobes, <em>Ureaplasma</em> species, and <em>Mycoplasma</em> species. We would not continue the first tocolytic or begin a second tocolytic if these tests were suggestive of subclinical infection. Amniotic fluid cultures are positive in almost 65 percent of women in whom tocolysis with a single agent is not successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>We base our selection of tocolytic drug on efficacy and safety. A &quot;network&quot; meta-analysis pools all available direct and indirect evidence on relative treatment effects into a single coherent analysis to estimate the relative effects of each treatment compared with every other treatment in a network, even though some treatment pairs may not have been directly compared. It also allows calculation of the probability that each treatment, or class or drugs, is the best for any given outcome. In a 2012 systematic review and network meta-analysis of 95 randomized trials of tocolytic therapy for preterm labor, all of the commonly used tocolytic agents (cyclooxygenase inhibitors, beta-agonists, calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>, oxytocin receptor antagonists) were statistically more effective than <span class=\"nowrap\">placebo/no</span> tocolytic for delaying delivery for 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>) and calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>) had the highest probability of being the best therapy for preterm labor on the basis of the four outcomes: delivery delayed by 48 hours, neonatal mortality, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and maternal side effects. (See <a href=\"#H1279823\" class=\"local\">'Cyclooxygenase inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1280923\" class=\"local\">'Calcium channel blockers'</a> below.) </p><p>A single course of therapy does not delay delivery by weeks or months because tocolytics do not remove the underlying stimulus that initiated preterm labor (eg, subclinical intraamniotic infection, abruption, uterine overdistension) or reverse parturitional uterine changes (eg, cervical dilation and effacement). There are no data on the role of repeated courses of tocolytics for treatment of recurrent preterm labor. If a second episode of acute preterm labor occurs, our indications for retreatment are the same as for a primary episode (ie, delay delivery for corticosteroid administration [primary or rescue] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maternal transfer).

Cyclooxygenase exists in two isoforms, COX 1 and COX 2. COX 1 is constitutively synthesized in gestational tissues, while COX 2 is inducible, dramatically increasing in the decidua and myometrium during term and preterm labor. Nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitors reduce prostaglandin production by inhibition of both COX 1 and 2; specific inhibitors are available for inhibition of COX 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1279961\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indomethacin</a>, a nonspecific COX inhibitor, is the most commonly used tocolytic of this class. In a 2015 systematic review of two randomized trials comparing indomethacin with placebo for treatment of preterm labor, use of indomethacin reduced the risk of delivery within 48 hours of initiation of treatment in both trials, but the confidence interval was wide (relative risk [RR] 0.20, 95% CI 0.03-1.28; two trials, n = 70) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There was no clear increase in any adverse neonatal outcome. In comparative trials, indomethacin reduced the risk of birth within 48 hours of initiation of treatment compared with any beta-agonist (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08-0.96; two trials, n =100) and appeared to be as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.58-2.01; two trials, n = 230).</p><p>There is limited information on the use of COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of preterm labor in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. Further evaluation of the safety and efficacy of selective COX 2 inhibitors for inhibition of preterm labor is warranted before introducing these drugs into clinical practice; however, most of these agents have either been withdrawn from the market or issued with boxed warnings regarding the risk of serious adverse events (discussed below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1279968\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal side effects, including nausea, esophageal reflux, gastritis, and emesis, are seen in approximately 4 percent of women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> for preterm labor.

Pulmonary edema probably results from several additive factors including fluid overload from excessive intravenous crystalloid infusion, decreased time for diastolic filling time due to increased heart rate, and the increased plasma volume of pregnancy.

In normal parturition, oxytocin stimulates contractions by inducing conversion of phosphatidylinositol to inositol triphosphate, which binds to a protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum causing release of calcium into the cytoplasm. Oxytocin receptor antagonists compete with oxytocin for binding to oxytocin receptors in the myometrium and decidua, thus preventing the increase in intracellular free calcium that occurs when oxytocin binds to its receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].
