Intraluminal thrombus impairs distal blood flow and may lead to myocardial ischemia or infarction. Intraluminal hemostasis is a dynamic process involving both clot formation and intrinsic fibrinolysis. The goal of antithrombotic therapy (the combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy) is to prevent clot extension and reformation in cases where the clot has undergone fibrinolysis either by intrinsic mechanisms, fibrinolytic treatment, or mechanical means. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of the vulnerable plaque in acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the evidence that supports the use of parenteral anticoagulant therapy in all patients with acute non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS), which include both unstable angina and acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The topic will provide recommendations for its use according to whether the patient receives reperfusion with percutaneous coronary intervention or no reperfusion therapy. Information regarding anticoagulant agents in ST-elevation myocardial infarction and the role of antiplatelet therapy in NSTEACS is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticoagulant-therapy-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticoagulant therapy in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet agents in acute non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF ANTICOAGULANT AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three classes of anticoagulants that have been evaluated in the management of acute coronary syndromes: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heparins, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) and the low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), are indirect thrombin inhibitors that complex with antithrombin (AT, formerly known as AT III) and convert AT from a slow to a rapid inactivator of thrombin, factor Xa, and to a lesser extent, factors XIIa, XIa, and IXa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are a few limitations to UFH therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. One potential issue is binding to circulating plasma proteins, which renders inter- and intra-patient dosing unpredictable and requires continuous intravenous rather than subcutaneous dosing for consistent anticoagulant effect. The propensity to develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is another limitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">LMWH inactivates factor Xa, like UFH, but has a lesser effect on thrombin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101832 \">figure 1</a>). LMWH does not prolong the aPTT in a predictable fashion. They have a number of advantages over UFH, including a more predictable anticoagulant effect and a reduced likelihood of inducing immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">LMWHs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadroparin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadroparin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinzaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinzaparin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dalteparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dalteparin</a>. The last three have been compared with placebo, UFH, or enoxaparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-therapy-in-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. These three seem to be as effective as UFH, may be less effective than enoxaparin, and may be associated with higher rates of major bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The synthetic heparin pentasaccharide <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> acts through antithrombin to exclusively neutralize factor Xa. Fondaparinux is the only non-heparin factor Xa inhibitor that has been evaluated for efficacy and safety in patients with NSTEACS and is available for clinical use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct oral anticoagulants and parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Direct factor Xa inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a>, inogatran, efegatran, lepirudin, hirudin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a> [Hirulog]) bind to and inactivate one or more of the active sites on the thrombin molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-therapy-in-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In addition, no significant difference in the rate of definite stent thrombosis was found. While not powered to assess the individual end points in the composite, the trial did not find any apparent difference between the two anticoagulants for the individual components, including major bleeding, which was 8.6 percent in each group.

For those individuals undergoing PCI in whom fondaparinux was chosen as the initial anticoagulant, we strongly recommend switching to standard-dose UFH (see <a href=\"#H167446349\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> below), with further dosing of the latter based on the activated clotting time, as was done in the <span class=\"nowrap\">FUTURA/OASIS</span> 8 trial (discussed below). Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a> has not been evaluated in patients started on fondaparinux, we believe that switching to bivalirudin is also a reasonable anticoagulant strategy. </p><p>In OASIS-5, 20,078 NSTEACS patients were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> twice daily) for a mean of six days (anticoagulant was generally stopped after PCI, if it was performed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulant-therapy-in-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Over 60 percent of patients underwent catheterization and over 30 percent had PCI.
