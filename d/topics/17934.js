The most common of these are obstructive sleep apnea, primary aldosteronism, and renal artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The possible presence of secondary rather than primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) is suggested by a number of clinical clues, one of which is resistant hypertension. Thus, secondary hypertension should be considered in all patients with resistant hypertension. The clinical clues suggesting secondary hypertension are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are probably the most common, and, if possible, any such medications should be discontinued or the dose lowered.

Both home and ambulatory blood pressure measurements help to identify white coat effect. Ambulatory measurements are a better predictor than office blood pressure measurements of cardiovascular morbidity (ie, end-organ damage) and mortality in patients with resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The main modalities include a lower-salt diet, weight loss in obese and overweight patients, and moderation of alcohol intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>A 24-hour urine collection can be used to estimate sodium intake. The completeness of the collection can be estimated from the urinary creatinine excretion, which is equal to creatinine production in the steady state. Normal values in adults under the age of 50 years are 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (177 to 221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg)</span> lean body weight in men and 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (133 to 177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg)</span> lean body weight in women. From the ages of 50 to 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in men), due primarily to a fall in muscle mass. A diet that is high in sodium may play an important role in drug-resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The goal sodium intake in patients with hypertension is discussed elsewhere.</p><p>Achieving lasting dietary changes is difficult, and professional guidance and follow-up with a certified dietitian or nutritionist is recommended, if available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following approach applies to patients with resistant hypertension who do not have a reversible secondary cause of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Identify and treat secondary hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p>The pharmacologic treatment of resistant hypertension, by definition, involves combinations of three or more drugs, including a diuretic. The choice of agents should be individualized and may depend upon consideration of prior benefit, history of adverse events, financial limitations, and the presence of concomitant disease processes such as chronic kidney disease or diabetes.</p><p>Regimens should be simplified, and long-acting combination agents should be used as much as possible in order to reduce the number of prescribed pills and to permit once-daily dosing. Treatment adherence worsens as the use of pills, complexity of the dosing regimen, and out-of-pocket costs increase. Medication-related adverse effects should be discussed, and side effects should be addressed, with down-titration of or substitution for the offending agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-adherence-and-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient adherence and the treatment of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent volume expansion (typically not sufficient to produce edema) contributes to resistant hypertension, even among patients who have been on conventional doses of thiazide diuretics. This was illustrated in a study of 279 patients with resistant hypertension, 85 percent of whom were being treated with a thiazide diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Serum brain-type natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide levels were significantly higher among patients with resistant hypertension compared to controls, suggesting volume expansion.</p><p>Effective diuretic use is almost always necessary to achieve blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Diuretics should be titrated until the blood pressure goal or the maximum recommended dose (as described below) has been reached or the patient has signs suggestive of overdiuresis such as fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, or decreased tissue perfusion as evidenced by an otherwise unexplained elevation in the serum creatinine concentration. If overdiuresis is suspected, diuretic therapy needs to be reduced.</p><p>In patients with little renal impairment, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a> are preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> for the treatment of resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Chlorthalidone and indapamide have a more potent antihypertensive effect than hydrochlorothiazide due, in part, to their longer half-life. The supportive data are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'Thiazide-like versus thiazide-type diuretics'</a>.)</p><p>Most studies that have compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> have evaluated patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Limited data suggest that chlorthalidone also provides comparatively greater benefit in patients with resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>We generally begin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> at 12.5 mg daily, which requires splitting of the 25 mg pill, with subsequent titration up to 25 mg daily or, rarely, higher. If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a> is used, we start at 1.25 mg daily, titrating up to 5 mg daily as needed. For patients already being treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, we stop that drug and substitute chlorthalidone or indapamide. Monitoring of serum electrolytes is necessary. Hypokalemia is a more common problem in patients with resistant hypertension, due at least in part to higher aldosterone levels, which explains the responsiveness of patients with resistant hypertension to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists'</a> below.)</p><p>Among patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, thiazide diuretics are less effective, and loop diuretics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>, may be necessary for effective volume control. Furosemide and bumetanide are relatively short acting and usually require at least twice-daily dosing. A loop diuretic with a longer duration of action and more consistent absorption, such as torsemide, may be more effective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment of hypertension in chronic kidney disease'</a>.)</p><p>At a given diuretic dose in stable hypertensive patients, urinary sodium and potassium loss only occur in the first 10 to 14 days of therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74940 \">figure 1</a>). Thereafter, the patient is in a steady state, in which the extracellular fluid volume is reduced but stable, and the serum potassium is stable at a level that is usually lower than baseline, assuming there are no major changes in diet or other medications that affect potassium balance (eg, angiotensin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for hypokalemia'</a>.)</p><p>A low dietary salt intake can enhance the efficacy of all antihypertensive medications and should be recommended, despite diuretic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Spironolactone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a> are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, while potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamterene</a>) block collecting tubule sodium channels that are normally opened by aldosterone. Spironolactone, eplerenone, and amiloride provide significant antihypertensive benefit when added to existing multiple-drug regimens in patients with resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. This effect may reflect, at least in part, significantly higher plasma aldosterone levels in patients with resistant hypertension compared with individuals who have normal blood pressure or controlled hypertension on one or two medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, spironolactone, which has been most widely studied, can also lower the blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension who have normal plasma and urine aldosterone levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The antihypertensive effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> was evaluated in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), which included 1411 patients whose blood pressure was not controlled on three antihypertensive drugs (mean blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">157/85</span> mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The mean baseline serum potassium was 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> and the mean serum creatinine was 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (99 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. The addition of spironolactone (median dose 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/daily)</span> as a fourth drug was associated with a mean <span class=\"nowrap\">22/10</span> mmHg reduction in blood pressure at one-year follow-up. The mean rise in serum potassium was 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> with hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> occurring in 4 percent. Spironolactone may be more likely to cause hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> in patients with resistant hypertension has been evaluated in several randomized trials, each of which found that it was more effective than placebo or other antihypertensive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/17,19,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,23-25</a>]. The best data come from the PATHWAY-2 trial, a randomized, double-blind crossover study comparing spironolactone (25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with placebo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxazosin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisoprolol</a> in 285 patients with resistant hypertension (mean clinic blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">157/90</span> mmHg and mean home blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">148/84</span> mmHg despite therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB], a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Spironolactone significantly reduced mean home systolic pressure at 12 weeks by 10 mmHg compared with placebo, by 5 mmHg compared with doxazosin, and by 6 mmHg compared with bisoprolol. Hyperkalemia developed in 2 percent of patients taking spironolactone; the frequency of serious adverse events and withdrawal of therapy due to adverse events was similar with each antihypertensive drug.</p><p>Patients who are being treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be monitored for the development of hyperkalemia. The risk is increased among patients with chronic kidney disease and among those who are also treated with other drugs that can cause hyperkalemia such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF REGIMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following approach applies to patients with resistant hypertension who do not have a reversible secondary cause of hypertension and who do not have a specific indication for a class of drugs (eg, beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker for rate control in atrial fibrillation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Identify and treat secondary hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p>Few studies have evaluated different drug combinations of three or more medications in the treatment of resistant hypertension. Our approach is to sequentially combine agents with different mechanisms of action. The triple combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>), and a long-acting thiazide diuretic (preferably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a>) is often effective and generally well tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p>Among patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are already being treated with such a three-drug regimen at maximum recommended and tolerated doses, we add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>. We usually begin spironolactone at 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (which requires splitting of a 25 mg tablet) before titrating to 25 and, if necessary, 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The risk of adverse effects such as gynecomastia, breast tenderness, and erectile dysfunction increases with higher doses. We generally do not increase the spironolactone dose above 50 mg daily in the absence of proven primary aldosteronism. The more specific aldosterone blocker, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>, is now generic and does not induce the side effects seen with spironolactone.

Possible agents that may be used include vasodilating beta blockers (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisoprolol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nebivolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nebivolol</a>), centrally acting agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanfacine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanfacine</a>), and direct vasodilators (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a>). If beta blockers are used, a vasodilating beta blocker, such as labetalol, carvedilol or nebivolol, may provide more antihypertensive benefit with fewer side effects compared to traditional beta blockers, particularly when high doses are used (although head-to-head full-dose comparisons are lacking) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Centrally acting agents may be effective, but adverse effects are common, and outcome data are lacking.

As an example, an open-label randomized trial (Renal Denervation for Hypertension [DENERHTN]) compared stepped antihypertensive therapy alone with stepped antihypertensive therapy plus renal denervation in 106 patients with confirmed resistant hypertension despite therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irbesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irbesartan</a> if allergic to angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

At six months, the change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic pressure decreased significantly more in the denervation group (-15.4 versus -9.5 mmHg). However, this study had several limitations. In addition to the lack of a sham intervention, all patients lost to follow-up were in the denervation group and were not analyzed, the number of antihypertensive medications used at six months was similar in both groups, and the baseline blood pressure was higher in the denervation group, suggesting that the results could be due in part to regression to the mean. A considerably smaller trial found that spironolactone lowered 24-hour ambulatory systolic pressure more than renal denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>However, a large, blinded, randomized trial (SYMPLICITY-HTN-3) failed to demonstrate benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In SYMPLICITY-HTN-3, 535 patients with treatment-resistant hypertension (systolic pressure &gt;160 mmHg despite three or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic) were assigned to renal denervation or a sham procedure; blood pressure decreased to a similar degree in both groups at six months, and there was no difference in the incidence of serious adverse events. Due to the lack of benefit, a larger ongoing international trial (SYMPLICITY-HTN-4) was halted prematurely.</p><p>Several other trials reached conclusions similar to SYMPLICITY-HTN-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. As an example, the open-label SYMPATHY trial randomly assigned 139 patients with resistant hypertension to routine care or routine care plus renal denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

A large and unexpected blood pressure reduction was observed among hypertensive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent percutaneous iliac arteriovenous anastomosis to increase their cardiac output and oxygen delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The same procedure was subsequently examined in an open-label trial of 83 adults with resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. At six months, percutaneous placement of an iliac arteriovenous anastomosis significantly lowered office systolic pressure (27 versus 4 mmHg) and 24-hour ambulatory systolic pressure (14 versus 1 mmHg) compared with usual care; these antihypertensive effects were maintained at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-resistant-hypertension/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Venous stenosis presenting as unilateral lower-extremity edema occurred in one-third of patients who underwent the anastomosis (29 percent at 6 months and 33 percent at 12 months); 13 other adverse events occurred in the treatment group, including one iliac artery dissection and one deep venous thrombosis.

Patients diagnosed with secondary causes of hypertension should be referred as needed to appropriate specialists, and, if present, obstructive sleep apnea should be treated. Medications that may be contributing to hypertension should be reduced, withdrawn, or avoided, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary causes of hypertension should be considered and, if present, treated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pharmacologic treatment of resistant hypertension involves combinations of three or more drugs. Some patients have a specific indication for a class of drugs (eg, beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker for rate control in atrial fibrillation). If there is no such indication, the preferred three-drug regimen consists of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a long-acting calcium channel blocker such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, and a long-acting thiazide diuretic, preferably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a>. Among patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, a loop diuretic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, is usually necessary for effective volume control.

We typically begin at 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and titrate up to, but not above, 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in the absence of proven primary aldosteronism. Monitoring of serum potassium levels for both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are necessary if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> and spironolactone are used.
