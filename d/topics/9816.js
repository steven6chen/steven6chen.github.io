The blood is made up of different types of cells. These cells are made in the middle of bones, in a part called the bone marrow.</p><p>In leukemia, the bone marrow makes abnormal blood cells instead of normal blood cells. The abnormal cells grow out of control, get into the blood, and travel around the body. Sometimes, these cells collect in certain parts of the body. When the bone marrow makes abnormal blood cells, it does not make the normal blood cells your child's body needs. This causes symptoms.</p><p>There are different types of leukemia. Some types grow quickly, and others grow slowly. Most leukemia in children is the fast-growing type, called &quot;acute&quot; leukemia. There are 2 types of acute leukemia. Most children who have leukemia have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called &quot;ALL.&quot; But some children with leukemia have acute myeloid leukemia, also called &quot;AML.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207516\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of leukemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired and weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding more easily than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting fevers or infections more easily than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain, which can make children limp or refuse to walk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen lymph nodes (bean-shaped organs) that you can see or feel under your child's skin</p><p/><p>These symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not leukemia. But if your child has these symptoms, let the doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207531\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for leukemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your child's symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bone marrow biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor takes a very small sample of the bone marrow. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope to check for cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207546\"><span class=\"h1\">How is leukemia in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right treatment for your child will depend on the type of leukemia he or she has. Treatment for leukemia can include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Children usually get these medicines through a thin tube that goes in their vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; Sometimes, children also get these medicines through a thin tube that goes in their back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow transplant (also called &quot;stem cell transplant&quot;) &ndash; This treatment replaces cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation. The &quot;donor&quot; cells can come from different places, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who are related to your child, and whose blood matches your child's</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who are not related to your child, but whose blood matches your child's</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood (that matches your child's) from a newborn baby's umbilical cord</p><p/><p>Most children are in &quot;remission&quot; after they start treatment. This means that doctors do not see any more abnormal blood cells in the blood or bone marrow. But even though doctors do not see any abnormal cells, they are still in the body. To kill these cells and keep the leukemia from returning, your child will need to finish treatment. It usually takes about 2 to 3 years to finish treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207561\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, the doctor will check your child every so often to see if the leukemia comes back. Follow-ups include talking with the doctor, exams, and blood tests. Sometimes, the doctor will also do a bone marrow biopsy.</p><p>You should also watch your child for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean the leukemia has come back. Tell the doctor or nurse if your child has any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207576\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the leukemia comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the leukemia comes back, your child might have more chemotherapy, radiation, or a bone marrow transplant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207591\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all of the doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to let the doctor know if your child has any side effects or problems during treatment.</p><p>Leukemia treatment can involve making many choices, such as what treatment your child should have and when. Always let the doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time your child is offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help my child live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if my child does not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207606\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukemia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Leukemia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-all-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myeloid-leukemia-aml-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preserving-fertility-after-cancer-treatment-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preserving fertility after cancer treatment in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
