However, these &quot;classic&quot; manifestations reflect end-stage disease. Now, with earlier diagnosis by echocardiography and prospective followup of patients, the following are the most common presenting symptoms (see early symptoms in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83004 \">figure 1</a>)): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea on exertion or decreased exercise tolerance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exertional dizziness (presyncope) or syncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exertional angina </p><p/><p>These three &ldquo;early symptoms&rdquo; are nonspecific. Care must be taken in attributing these symptoms to AS since most patients with these symptoms do not have AS. (See <a href=\"#H196138589\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The patient with AS is generally asymptomatic for a prolonged period despite the obstruction and increased pressure load on the left ventricle. There is wide variability in the degree of outflow obstruction that causes symptoms, depending in part upon patient size and level of physical activity. As a result, there is no single value of maximum aortic transvalvular velocity, mean transvalvular gradient, or aortic valve area that identifies when symptoms will occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630 \">table 2</a>). In general, symptoms in patients with AS and normal left ventricular systolic function rarely occur until stenosis is severe (defined as valve area is &lt;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>, the jet velocity is over 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the mean transvalvular gradient &ge;40 mmHg) and some patients with severe AS remain asymptomatic. </p><p>In adults with moderate AS, care should be taken to avoid attributing symptoms caused by other disease processes (noncardiac or cardiac) to AS: Dyspnea may be due to deconditioning or lung disease, ankle edema has many causes other than heart failure, and nonanginal chest or shoulder pain is not a symptom of AS. However, when severe AS is present, even mild cardiac symptoms require prompt intervention because average survival without valve replacement is only two to three years, with a high risk of sudden death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83004 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Care is required to identify the cause of cardiac symptoms in patients with AS with concurrent cardiac conditions such as coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy.

Two factors can contribute: diastolic dysfunction with an increase in left ventricular filling pressures with exercise, and an inability of the left ventricle to increase the cardiac output during exercise.</p><p>Systolic left ventricular dysfunction is rare, and overt HF is a late, often end-stage finding, usually in patients who have not received regular medical care. Once overt HF occurs, the patient may complain of shortness of breath, easy fatigability, debilitation, and other signs and symptoms of a low cardiac output state. Patients with severe low-gradient AS with either reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or normal LVEF may present with HF, angina, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), which is uncommon in isolated AS, often accompanies HF. (See <a href=\"#H112078914\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmias'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Dizziness and syncope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several proposed explanations for exertional dizziness (presyncope) or syncope in patients with AS, both of which reflect decreased cerebral perfusion.

Approximately one-half of these patients have underlying coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is also seen in a minority of patients with severe AS without angina. (See <a href=\"#H112079202\" class=\"local\">'Concurrent coronary disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Angina in patients with AS without significant obstructive coronary artery disease has been attributed to left ventricular hypertrophy, which can cause coronary ischemia by other mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased left ventricular oxygen demand as a result of increased left ventricular mass; the myocardial oxygen uptake per gram is normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression of intramyocardial coronary arteries from prolonged contraction and impaired myocardial relaxation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced diastolic coronary perfusion time during tachycardia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced coronary flow reserve</p><p/><p>An additional factor that may contribute to angina was identified by a study of intracoronary pressures and flow velocities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Coronary diastolic suction fell (rather than rose) with increasing heart rate in patients with severe AS. Appropriate increase in coronary diastolic suction with increasing heart rate was restored immediately after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination often provides the first clue to the presence of AS. The physical examination correlates with the severity of AS, though no combination of physical findings has both a high sensitivity and high specificity for excluding severe AS, particularly in asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A review of clinical studies evaluated the published evidence on the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination for abnormal systolic murmurs; most studies used cardiology examiners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. &#160; Three findings were most useful for diagnosis of significant AS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A slow rate of rise in the carotid pulse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mid to late peak intensity of the murmur</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced intensity of the second heart sound</p><p/><p>In a later study from the same authors murmur loudest in the second right intercostal space was also suggestive, and patients with three of these four findings were very likely to have aortic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. On the other hand, patients with severe AS may have a soft murmur and may have an apparently normal carotid upstroke due to concurrent vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, the most useful findings for ruling out significant aortic stenosis are the absence of any systolic murmur and a normal second heart sound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>The quality of the pulse, murmur intensity and timing, and abnormalities in S2 correlate with the severity of AS. In one report, carotid upstroke delay, carotid pulse amplitude, murmur intensity, murmur peak, and a single second heart sound correlated with AS severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Although the classic findings of severe AS are accurate for confirming the presence of severe valve obstruction, the physical examination is less useful for excluding the presence of severe AS in patients with symptoms and a systolic murmur. Echocardiography is still necessary since none of the physical findings has both a high sensitivity and high specificity for severe valvular obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Carotid pulse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The quality of the arterial pulse in AS reflects the obstruction to blood flow into the peripheral arterial circulation. The arterial pulse has been described as &quot;parvus and tardus,&quot; (ie, it is small or weak and rises slowly). This is best appreciated in the carotid artery where the pulse is reduced in amplitude and delayed in occurrence. However, the amplitude of the carotid upstroke may be preserved in older patients with AS due to vascular changes. The delay can be appreciated by simultaneous palpation of the apex (point of maximum impulse) and the carotid artery. There may also be an associated carotid artery thrill or coarse vibration (&quot;shuddering&quot;) due to the marked turbulence of blood flow across the stenotic valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Precordial palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardiac impulse at the apex is sustained and is initially normal in location. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-precordial-pulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the precordial pulsation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Some patients have a palpable fourth heart sound (S4) due to vigorous left atrial contraction into the noncompliant ventricle. In addition, a systolic thrill may be felt at the base of the heart (second intercostal space) or at the sternal notch, especially during full expiration with the patient leaning forward.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stenosis of the aortic leaflets is associated with reduced mobility and delayed closure. This leads to the following changes in the heart sounds (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>S2 is soft and single since A2, which is due to aortic valve closure, is delayed and tends to occur simultaneously with P2, which is due to pulmonic valve closure. The S2 may become paradoxically split when the stenosis is severe and associated with left ventricular dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67896\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67896 \">movie 1</a>). With increasingly severe, fixed AS, the A2 closing sound may disappear. The presence of a normal split S2 is the most reliable finding to exclude severe AS in adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first heart sound (S1) is usually normal. However, an aortic ejection click, which is more commonly heard with a congenital bicuspid valve, may be heard after S1 early in AS when the leaflets are stiff, but still somewhat compliant and mobile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77091\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77091 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72877\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef72877 \">movie 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vigorous left atrial contraction against a stiff, noncompliant ventricle can produce a fourth heart sound (S4).</p><p/><p>The murmur associated with AS is described as a systolic &quot;ejection&quot; murmur. It is typically heard best at the base of the heart in the &quot;aortic&quot; area (second intercostal space on the right) where it has a harsh quality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77091\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77091 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56063\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56063 \">movie 4</a>). The murmur is transmitted well and equally to the carotid arteries. Diminished intensity in one carotid artery may indicate the presence of a stenosis in that vessel.</p><p>The murmur generally begins after S1 and ends before S2. The intensity of the murmur reflects the amount and velocity of blood flow across the valve and the turbulence produced by the stenosis. A loud murmur (grade 4 or greater) has a high specificity for severe aortic stenosis. However, most patients with severe stenosis have a grade 3 murmur and many have only a grade 1 or 2 murmur.</p><p>The timing of the murmur also correlates with the severity of the stenosis, similar to the timing of the carotid pulse. An early peaking murmur is typical for mild to moderate AS, while a late peaking murmur is consistent with severe AS. However, evaluation of the timing of the murmur is not reproducible among examiners and is therefore of limited clinical utility.</p><p>The murmur may also radiate to the apex of the heart, where it may have a different quality (musical due to high frequency vibrations) and may be louder, suggesting that the patient also has mitral regurgitation. This is known as the Gallavardin phenomenon. Another finding that has led to the misperception of two murmurs with different etiologies is that the murmur is often softer or even inaudible in the chest area between the apex and base.</p><p>In almost all patients, AS is associated with a small degree of aortic regurgitation since the stiff, calcified, and rigid aortic valve leaflets may not coapt normally. In this setting, a soft diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation may be heard. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112078552\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chest radiograph is not generally required when evaluating AS but may be obtained in some patients who present with heart failure and also in some patients who present with dyspnea to exclude other causes for shortness of breath. </p><p>The routine chest radiograph is usually normal when AS is mild to moderate. In adults with severe calcific AS, calcification of the aortic leaflets and aortic root may be visible on an overpenetrated chest radiograph or on fluoroscopy, but it is rarely detected on routine chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74730\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74730 \">image 1</a>). By contrast, in children or young adults with congenital AS, the leaflets may be severely fibrotic and immobile without calcification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar aortic stenosis in children&quot;</a>.) A rounding of the left ventricular apex suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy may be identified in some patients with severe AS.</p><p><br/>Another finding that may be identified on the chest radiograph is dilatation of the ascending aorta, which is due to the tissue abnormalities associated with a bicuspid aortic valve or to coexisting atherosclerosis or hypertension in patients with calcific disease.

Symptoms such as dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance, dizziness, syncope, and angina pectoris may or may not be present in patients with severe AS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112932616\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is the primary test in diagnosis and evaluation of aortic stenosis. Echocardiography has largely replaced cardiac catheterization for hemodynamic measurements to assess the severity of AS. An electrocardiogram is not indicated for diagnosis for AS but is generally performed as a component of the initial evaluation. Exercise testing is suggested in selected patients with asymptomatic severe AS (maximum aortic valve velocity of &ge;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> or mean aortic valve pressure gradient &ge;40 mm) to confirm asymptomatic status. Exercise testing should not be performed in patients with symptomatic severe AS. The role of natriuretic peptide levels in the diagnosis and evaluation of AS is uncertain. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance may be helpful but the availability of this technique is limited. Cardiac catheterization is recommended if the noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42882685\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transthoracic echocardiogram is indicated to diagnose and evaluate aortic stenosis (AS) in patients with signs or symptoms of AS. The echocardiographic exam in patients with AS includes evaluation of valve anatomy and structure, valve hemodynamics, hemodynamic consequences (left ventricular [LV] size and function and pulmonary artery pressure), and concomitant aortic regurgitation and other valve disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-aortic-valve\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the aortic valve&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-aortic-valve-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of aortic valve disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with AS, the aortic leaflets are generally thickened and calcified, and have a reduced excursion with a small or barely discernible aortic orifice during systole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80369%7ECARD%2F61369%7ECARD%2F59344%7ECARD%2F59538\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80369 graphicRef61369 graphicRef59344 graphicRef59538 \">movie 5A-D</a>). In contrast, in children or young adults with congenital AS, the leaflets may be severely fibrotic and immobile without calcification (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar aortic stenosis in children&quot;</a>). A reduced orifice size from AS should be distinguished from reduced leaflet excursion seen in heart failure or other conditions that cause a reduction of blood flow across the aortic valve.</p><p>When a bicuspid aortic valve is present, systolic images show the two leaflets (and two commissures) of the open valve. A bicuspid valve may appear trileaflet on diastolic images if a raphe is present. In patients with bicuspid aortic valve, the risk of associated aortic root involvement is related to the specific bicuspid valve phenotype (congenital fusion of the right and left versus the right and noncoronary cusps) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66664%7ECARD%2F59607%7ECARD%2F71102\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66664 graphicRef59607 graphicRef71102 \">movie 6A-C</a>).

Doppler echocardiography provides the most reliable noninvasive estimation of the pulmonary artery pressure. The pulmonary artery pressure may be increased in AS because of the chronic elevation in left ventricular diastolic filling pressure. A severe elevation in pulmonary artery pressure (systolic pressure &gt;50 mmHg) occurs in approximately 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In some cases, pulmonary hypertension is due to coexisting lung disease rather than to the effects of aortic valve obstruction.

The association between chronic gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia and calcific aortic stenosis has been termed Heyde syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In a series of 42 patients with severe AS who underwent aortic valve replacement, for example, nine had a history of skin or mucosal bleeding (causing manifestations such as epistaxis and ecchymoses) and four had a history of gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

This abnormality is thought to result from mechanical disruption of von Willebrand multimers during turbulent passage through the narrowed valve and from a von Willebrand factor interaction with platelets that triggers platelet clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. The severity of the von Willebrand factor abnormality is directly related to the severity of the AS, as measured by the mean transvalvular gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/46,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48,49</a>]. The hemostatic abnormality is corrected after surgery but recurs within six months of valve replacement in two-thirds of patients, particularly in the presence of a mismatch between patient and prosthesis (an effective orifice area &lt;0.8 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>.

This appears to be an infrequent complication. In a cohort study that included 515 patients with calcific AS, 300 with aortic valve calcification without stenosis, and 562 controls, the stroke rates were not different at two years (5, 8, and 5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112079202\"><span class=\"h2\">Concurrent coronary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe isolated AS is primarily a disease of older patients.

However, the most common symptoms in patients who are followed prospectively are often nonspecific (eg, decreased exercise tolerance, dyspnea on exertion, and dizziness), so care must be taken in attributing these symptoms to AS. Prompt attention is required when even mild symptoms develop in a patient with severe AS given the poor prognosis with medical management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83004 \">figure 1</a>).

There is wide variability in the degree of outflow obstruction that causes symptoms, depending in part upon patient size and level of physical activity. As a result, there are no hemodynamic values that identify when symptoms will occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630 \">table 2</a>).
