All <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/caretakers</span> should be periodically trained in how to recognize and treat anaphylaxis and should carry an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector at all times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation for treating possible anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with extensive skin involvement or elevated serum baseline tryptase may be at increased risk for anaphylaxis from a variety of triggers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], although the risk of anaphylaxis in children with cutaneous mastocytosis is much smaller than that of adult patients with systemic disease (9 versus 49 percent cumulative incidence according to one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One series found that children with tryptase levels &gt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> are more likely to require daily antimediator treatment to manage symptoms and prevent severe episodes, and those with levels &gt;15.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> were at risk for hospitalization due to severe symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis. Mastocytosis patients or their caretakers should have at least two doses of epinephrine in a self-injectable form available at all times for treatment of possible anaphylaxis, since a single dose may be inadequate to counteract a massive release of mediators. Clinicians should also make patients and caregivers aware of the importance of lying down with the legs elevated during anaphylaxis involving hypotension. Hypotension during anaphylaxis is more common than asthma or laryngeal edema in patients with mastocytosis, and ensuring that patients are placed in this position as soon as possible is an important therapeutic intervention. The treatment of anaphylaxis in adults and children is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mastocytosis patients should consider wearing a medical identification bracelet and should carry an anaphylaxis emergency action plan or wallet card that identifies the condition and describes the proper treatment of anaphylaxis <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF+Documents/Libraries/Anaphylaxis-Emergency-Action-Plan.pdf&amp;token=/C5Q/iCB/2LLCwV7T8HK2lwm6sR/kEZoNaIqN/73HXSOVycSIPyputPn68SH00rxz4XgltVFJ9rSmMATkiTNtTCeVQHr44rjlSZkcJVXEDbh+x3d7qqBZUqDAak3uoXk/I0U9CKYd1MPL7MRKdB8kw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4785\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan &ndash; English)</a> <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF+Documents/Spanish/Anaphylaxis-Emergency-Action-Plan-Spanish.pdf&amp;token=Ls+BUTXwAuTJRkpRQ4LA1JgGv03onx4w09YFWrjDcTMb8nQK70M4sv3yKBB6Ojk/BSHuni4YwWs1wy9vgRTN0JU2OPH9WbcbiuH8WjlQ7CNVIxv/GWSD5R2OrOOaPAI/dBm3AtkXm1l5Bk3m72nDvg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4785\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan &ndash; Spanish)</a> <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF+Documents/Libraries/Anaphylaxis-Card.pdf&amp;token=Py6IaQmoqUBqjXL3OMmoExyYxpjs7fi04iG637wia+AWKpR/goqSD4AuPsKhj/LpWJJ900QGWWMbcQdCM7kwDMrZyJwwTc2z9is7r9hNl3hnnFZwx1FuCme5qzUAuyxN&amp;TOPIC_ID=4785\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan &ndash; Wallet card)</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Trigger avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should avoid exposures that trigger or aggravate their symptoms, to the extent possible. These exposures may include heat, humidity, cold, emotional stress, exercise, alcohol, and lack of sleep. In infants and young children, irritability (fussing, whining, anger), overexcitement, fever, teething, and skin rubbing can induce symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Spicy foods, such as those containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>, may cause flushing, nasal congestion, and gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients. Patients should avoid only those triggers that bother them. Empiric avoidance of these factors by all patients is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Problematic medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are various medications that may cause mast cell activation in patients with either cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis.

A study reviewed anesthetic management of 22 children with mastocytosis (14 with cutaneous and 8 with systemic disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Most of these patients were receiving medications to counteract mast cell mediators, which were continued before and after the procedures, although other medications were administered at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. The study found that the perioperative courses were uncomplicated and without serious adverse events. Another retrospective series found that among 45 children with mastocytosis, most of whom had cutaneous disease, general anesthesia was usually well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications that are usually tolerated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, local anesthetics, and benzodiazepines. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fentanyl</a> appears to be a less potent mast cell degranulator than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> in equimolar concentrations in vitro, although fentanyl has not been specifically studied in patients with mastocytosis.</p><p>If anesthesia is required in a patient with no previous history of exposure to anesthetics, certain agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisatracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisatracurium</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancuronium</a>, are recommended over others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A volatile anesthetic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, can be used to maintain anesthesia. However, allergic reactions to any medication can develop without precedent, and the clinician must be prepared to handle any such reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1370673\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication before anticipated trigger exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can be premedicated in advance of an anticipated exposure to a possible or known trigger. The approach for patients with cutaneous mastocytosis is similar to that for those with systemic mastocytosis and is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Preparation for medical and surgical procedures'</a>.)</p><p>Children with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis can be especially sensitive to all provoking factors and vaccinations, and exposure can trigger exacerbations and bullous eruptions. Premedication is recommended for procedures involving general anesthesia or radiocontrast injection and before the administration of vaccines. We suggest the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (up to 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> as well as both H1 and H2 antihistamines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of coexistent allergic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mastocytosis may have concomitant allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, food allergies, and drug allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. However, the incidence of allergic disease in patients with mastocytosis does not appear to be increased, compared with the general population. In most cases, these conditions should be managed as they would be in patients without mastocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The administration of subcutaneous immunotherapy for respiratory allergies warrants careful consideration in patients with mastocytosis, because they are at greater risk for systemic reactions and anaphylaxis as a consequence of the therapy itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hymenoptera venom hypersensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with systemic mastocytosis are at increased risk for anaphylaxis in response to Hymenoptera stings, compared with patients who are sensitive to these venoms but do not have mastocytosis.

Less is known about the risk of sting-induced anaphylaxis in children with cutaneous mastocytosis. Patients with IgE-mediated systemic reactions to Hymenoptera stings should be offered venom immunotherapy to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis upon subsequent stings. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of coexistent allergic disease'</a> above.)</p><p>Despite the risk of systemic allergic reactions to immunotherapy, venom immunotherapy has been shown to be beneficial for patients with cutaneous (or systemic) mastocytosis who have evidence of venom-specific IgE (ie, positive skin or IgE tests to Hymenoptera venoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Therefore, venom immunotherapy is recommended for patients with cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis, who also have a history of systemic symptoms following a known or suspected sting, and evidence of venom-specific IgE. The evaluation and management of Hymenoptera venom reactions in patients with mastocytosis are discussed separately. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, anti-IgE, has helped during immunotherapy to provide maintenance to patients with severe initial reactions and reactions with build-up of immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

This medication is generally mixed into a glass of water and taken one hour before meals and then before bed.

This should be administered with caution, because NSAIDs can trigger mediator release in some patients and may precipitate peptic ulcer disease. Techniques for safely administering aspirin to patients with mastocytosis are reviewed separately. Aspirin should not be used concomitantly with other NSAIDs.

However, the benefit is short-lived, and this should not be considered a form of long-term management because of the side effects associated with chronic glucocorticoid use, including adrenal suppression if they are applied to large areas. Glucocorticoid creams or ointments may be applied to the skin of children older than two years. For areas &lt;10 percent of body surface area (BSA) or for solitary mastocytomas, the preparation can be applied under an occlusive dressing. For &gt;10 percent BSA, some experts recommend that the topical corticosteroid be diluted one part to three parts and applied for three to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psoralen-ultraviolet A therapy (PUVA) or narrow band UVB decreases the number of mast cells and controls pruritus that cannot be managed with antihistamines alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with itching or flushing due to diffuse cutaneous involvement or UP, we suggest H1 antihistamines as initial therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Antihistamines may be administered on a scheduled or as-needed basis, depending upon symptom frequency. We typically begin treatment with nonsedating antihistamines and reserve sedating agents for refractory symptoms or as-needed use. Cromoglycate ointments may also help control cutaneous disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Antihistamines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cromoglycates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, heartburn, cramping, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea, we suggest H2 antihistamines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> as initial therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Leukotriene-modifying agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of isolated cutaneous mastocytomas involves avoiding physical contact or rubbing of the lesion(s), as this causes mediator release and systemic symptoms. Systemic symptoms are managed primarily with antihistamines. Surgical removal is rarely necessary, unless the patient experiences uncontrollable systemic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous mastocytomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis for young children with cutaneous mastocytosis is excellent, because the majority will experience spontaneous resolution before puberty. However, such children should be followed to assure that symptoms have stabilized or resolved. In contrast, cutaneous disease that first develops after two years of age tends to be persistent, and many patients will develop systemic forms of mastocytosis.
