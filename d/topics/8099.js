Interventions directed at reducing complications of hemophilia and its treatment are paramount. At the same time, routine health maintenance and comprehensive care is critical to decrease other health risks that have the potential to become more complicated due to the underlying bleeding disorder.</p><p>Integrated care should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis of hemophilia is made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This includes decisions about use of factor prophylaxis, methods to minimize bleeding risk, modifications to facilitate routine comprehensive care, and counseling regarding psychosocial issues and disease inheritance. Education about the disease is important for families, especially those with newborns with a new hemophilia diagnosis, since the newborn will be the first family member with hemophilia in approximately one-third of families.

Early infant dental intervention is recommended to teach proper brushing and ensure adequate household water fluoridation. The teeth should be cleaned routinely, and anticipated problem areas for causing bleeding should be discussed. An example is frenulum injury as a cause of bleeding in young children. Management of dental procedures is discussed separately.

Benefits include maintenance of a healthy weight, cardiovascular risk reduction, and positive effects on strength, flexibility, balance, and bone density, all of which contribute to decreased stress on joints. Exercise is also valuable for socialization and psychological health, which may be affected by a chronic condition such as hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Children with hemophilia are vulnerable to loss of physical conditioning, reduced bone density, and excessive weight <span class=\"nowrap\">gain/obesity</span> due to activity restrictions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The role of an exercise program is best discussed early to support positive lifelong habits and health.</p><p>The World Federation of Haemophilia Working Group on Physical Therapy and the National Hemophilia Foundation Physical Therapy Committee have developed patient educational materials that quantify some of the musculoskeletal benefits and risks of organized and individual physical exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The best approach to defining individual athletic regimens involves consultation between the staff at a local HTC; the patient; and for minor children, the parents and caregivers.</p><p>Ideal activities are those that reflect the individual's preferences, abilities, and local resources, and include non-contact sports such as swimming, walking, golf, tennis, bicycling, archery, and table tennis, and supervised group activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In one series of 37 children with severe hemophilia A or B who were receiving prophylactic factor infusions, the frequency of joint bleeding was low (&lt;1 bleed or injury per season) and did not differ between high impact activities (eg, basketball, karate, skateboarding) and low impact activities (eg, cycling, swimming, hiking) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Examples of high and low impact sports are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109841\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109841 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Consultation with a specialist regarding protective gear, splints, and prophylactic factor infusions timed around the activities should be initiated early and as needed. Additional information about specific activities is provided in a publication from the National Hemophilia Foundation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1642303544\"><span class=\"h2\">Medicines to avoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines that increase the risk of bleeding, including anticoagulants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should generally be avoided in patients with hemophilia. Pain can be treated with local measures (eg, cold packs, immobilization, splinting), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, propoxyphene, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>. Cardiovascular disease prevention should focus on diet, exercise, smoking avoidance, and control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>Rare exceptions may include the following; consultation with a hemophilia expert or HTC is advised:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with cardiovascular disease for whom the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks, with consideration given to institution of a replacement regimen that provides protection.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>It is also important to discuss herbal remedies and over-the-counter supplements such as fish oil, which may increase bleeding risk and are not always volunteered by the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These may not need to be strictly avoided, but the physician should be aware of their use and have a discussion about the possible impact on bleeding risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3618317843\"><span class=\"h2\">Planning for invasive procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals with hemophilia who are undergoing elective surgery, collaboration between the surgeon, hematologist, and laboratory and transfusion medicine services should occur, with sufficient time to allow a smooth surgical course in which factor levels can be monitored and replacement therapy administered on time. The specific factor dosing schedule and appropriate target factor levels depend on the individual patient and procedure being performed; some individuals may be able to use products other than clotting factor (eg, DDAVP for mild hemophilia A). These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H901872873\"><span class=\"h2\">DDAVP test dose for mild hemophilia A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DDAVP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>) is a synthetic analog of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) that promotes release of factor VIII and its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) from storage pools in platelet granules and endothelial cells. For individuals with mild hemophilia A (factor VIII activity level between 5 and 40 percent), a DDAVP test dose can be given to determine whether DDAVP is effective in that individual, and if so, whether it can be used to raise the factor VIII level in the setting of mild bleeding or minor invasive procedures. This should be done at least one week before a planned procedure, since tachyphylaxis occurs. Usually it is done as part of routine comprehensive care so that DDAVP can be used for a variety of mild bleeding scenarios, including surgical, traumatic, or spontaneous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b#H3633197134\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B&quot;, section on 'Patient with mild hemophilia'</a>.)</p><p>The DDAVP test dose should be performed when the individual is well. It involves a baseline measurement of factor VIII activity level, followed by administration of DDAVP, followed by measurement of a post-DDAVP factor VIII activity level. DDAVP can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or intranasally (with a nasal spray).</p><p>Dosing and post-DDAVP factor VIII level measurement is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravenous or subcutaneous DDAVP</strong> &ndash; Give 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> (maximum dose, 20 mcg). The intravenous form is diluted in 50 mL of normal saline and infused over 20 to 30 minutes. Obtain the post-DDAVP factor VIII level approximately 60 minutes after DDAVP administration. The dose maximum of 20 mcg is commonly used in the United States due to concerns about increasing toxicity and diminishing efficacy at higher doses, although there are no data directly comparing different dose caps in a large sample of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intranasal DDAVP</strong> &ndash; When using the nasal spray it is important to use the product intended for hemostatic therapy (Stimate) rather than the product for enuresis, since the dose is higher for bleeding disorders (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> rather than 0.01 percent). Give one puff (150 mcg in one nostril) in patients weighing &lt;50 kg and two puffs (150 mcg in both nostrils) in patients weighing &ge;50 kg. Obtain the post-DDAVP factor VIII level approximately 90 minutes after DDAVP administration.</p><p/><p>In individuals for whom this is effective, an approximately two- to fourfold increase in factor VIII activity level is expected at approximately 60 minutes after an infusion or 90 minutes after an intranasal dose, with the response persisting for 6 to 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some individuals have a lower or greater increase. Additional doses may be given; however, tachyphylaxis may occur with repeated dosing, and dosing at intervals shorter than 24 hours may be associated with increased risk of water retention. One study of serial DDAVP doses found a 30 percent lower peak level in factor VIII increase between the first and second doses of DDAVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The likelihood of response to DDAVP has been assessed in several case series. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of intravenous DDAVP test doses given to 62 boys with mild hemophilia A at one institution, 29 (47 percent) had at least a twofold increase in factor VIII level one hour after administration of DDAVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The likelihood of response was greatest in those with higher baseline factor levels and with increasing age; an additional seven boys who did not have an initial response and were retested approximately five years later did have a response upon retesting. Another report that included 20 patients with mild hemophilia A documented DDAVP responses in 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 22 individuals (11 with hemophilia A and 11 with von Willebrand disease [VWD]) who had a documented response to intravenous DDAVP at 60 minutes and were subsequently tested for the response to intranasal DDAVP (Stimate) at 90 minutes, all of the patients with hemophilia A had increases in factor VIII levels (median increment of 30 percent [from 17&plusmn;11 percent to 50&plusmn;25 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This was less than the median increment with intravenous DDAVP of 62 percent, but 9 of 11 had a final factor VIII level above 20 percent, which is minimally hemostatic in specific instances. A study in 10 volunteers without hemophilia documented that intravenous and intranasal DDAVP produced similar responses, supporting the usefulness of the intranasal route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>DDAVP is generally reserved for minor bleeding or minor invasive procedures in individuals with mild hemophilia A. Severe, life-threatening bleeding should be treated with factor infusion because the response to DDAVP is not immediate and may not raise the factor VIII level for optimal hemostasis. Individuals with moderate to severe hemophilia A (factor VIII level &lt;5 percent) are unlikely to derive benefit because the incremental increase in factor VIII level would be insufficient for hemostasis. An exception might be an individual with a factor VIII level closer to 5 percent who wishes to use this therapy and testing may be performed to determine its utility.

At a minimum, an emergency supply of hemostatic replacement therapy should be kept with the patient during travel. In addition, knowledge of the available HTC either along the route or at the final destination is needed.

Prophylactic therapy also reduces the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) which is less common than joint bleeding but potentially much more devastating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Mild or moderate factor deficiency with a decreased clinical bleeding phenotype may be important decision-making points favoring on-demand therapy (ie, factor given only in the setting of acute bleeding or surgery, also called episodic therapy). Individuals may decide to change from on-demand to prophylactic therapy (or vice versa) based on the perceived burden and their health status.</p><p>The terminology for prophylaxis was revised in the 2012 World Federation of Hemophilia guideline to clarify whether prophylaxis is primary (before a bleeding event has occurred) or secondary, and continuous or intermittent (eg, for a few months at a time) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109728 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary prophylaxis</strong> &ndash; Individuals who have not had a bleeding episode but are at high risk of bleeding based on severe factor deficiency (eg, factor VIII or factor IX activity level &lt;1 percent) are recommended to receive primary prophylaxis due to the high risk of spontaneous bleeding and efficacy of prophylaxis in preventing bleeding and its complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Primary prophylaxis has been used extensively in parts of Europe, particularly in Sweden, and has been accepted by the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) of the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) and the Pediatric Working Party of the United Kingdom Haemophilia Doctors' Organisation (UKHDO) as the optimal treatment modality for patients with severe hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary prophylaxis</strong> &ndash; For individuals who have had more than one bleeding episode (eg, two or more bleeds into a target joint, evidence of joint disease by physical examination or radiography), secondary prophylaxis may be appropriate to prevent further morbidity, regardless of factor activity level.

Intermittent prophylaxis (also called &quot;short-term prophylaxis&quot;), which is administered for several weeks to months and then discontinued, may be used in specific circumstances such as high-impact physical activities, joint bleeding, or surgical procedures. We are more likely to use prophylaxis in those with lower baseline factor levels (eg, closer to 5 percent) and in those with moderate factor VIII deficiency than those with moderate factor IX deficiency.</p><p/><p>Many individuals for whom prophylaxis is appropriate may not have access to factor infusions due to high costs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of resources. In resource-limited settings, options for those who cannot receive regular prophylaxis include intermittent prophylaxis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prophylaxis using lower doses. As an example, a 2016 study from India of patients with factor VIII deficiency found that prophylaxis using factor VIII at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> (rather than the usual 25 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg)</span> twice per week was cost-effective and significantly reduced joint bleeds and school absenteeism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Evidence for the benefit of prophylaxis in reducing morbidity comes from randomized trials and observational studies, as well as experience with individuals who have factor activity levels above 1 to 2 percent and have significantly lower bleeding rates than those with factor levels &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2007 trial randomly assigned 65 boys with hemophilia A (factor VIII activity &lt;2 percent) who were under 30 months of age to receive prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> every other day) or episodic therapy only at the time of joint bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At six years of age, imaging studies of the ankles, knees, and elbows using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. This showed a greater protection from joint damage (all six joints normal) in those assigned to prophylaxis (25 of 27 boys [93 percent]) compared with those assigned to episodic treatment (16 of 29 [55 percent]), with a relative risk (RR) of joint damage with episodic therapy of 6.1 (95% CI 1.5-24.4). Total bleeding events (joints and other sites) were also significantly less in the prophylaxis group (mean, 3.3 versus 17.7 per person per year).

Total bleeding events were significantly less in the prophylaxis arm (mean 38 versus 82 over the entire study period). Joint preservation was especially good in those who started prophylaxis at the age of three years or younger; none of the eight patients who began prophylaxis by age three had joint damage, compared with 3 of 10 (30 percent) of children of the same age assigned to episodic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trials in adults who were previously receiving on-demand therapy and converted to prophylaxis have all noted reductions in bleeding episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>].

We individualize the choice of replacement product based on the patient's circumstances and needs, following an open discussion with the patient regarding data on specific products.

High titer inhibitors bind to exogenously administered replacement factor and prevent it from achieving hemostasis. Inhibitor development is greatest in those with severe deficiency because it is most likely that the infused factor will be seen as a foreign protein in these individuals.

Plasma-derived factor concentrates have been free of HIV, HBV, and HCV transmission since approximately 1993; however, concerns remain that potential transmission of blood borne diseases could occur, and this must be understood by patients and caregivers.

These products have the advantage of decreasing the dosing interval while maintaining adequate factor levels, especially for factor IX. These products are often more expensive per unit compared with other plasma-derived and recombinant products. However, the decreased dosing interval may reduce the need for a central venous catheter and the risk of catheter-associated complications in some patients. We often use these products for prophylaxis in children and individuals with factor IX deficiency who require prophylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Details of available longer half-life products, their mechanisms of action, dosing, and efficacy are presented below.

However, overall cost depends on how the product is used and the rate of breakthrough bleeding. Even the most expensive product may be cost-effective if it reduces the frequency of bleeding. Cost and third party coverage for factor products that takes into account the patient's clinical circumstances must be discussed. Countries and local institutions may have specific agreements in place that result in cost reductions. Enrollment in a clinical trial may also be an option for cost reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>All of the available factor replacement products are administered intravenously, with the majority requiring reconstitution. There is ongoing work in the development of therapies for subcutaneous administration. (See <a href=\"#H709337\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic therapies under development'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512195504\"><span class=\"h3\">Age of initiation and dosing schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of prophylaxis is to reduce (or, ideally, prevent) bleeding. Thus, it is generally initiated at as young an age as reasonably possible. Dosing is scheduled to maintain sustained, protective factor levels. However, both age at initiation and dosing frequency need to be balanced against the risks and burdens of therapy that is administered intravenously. In many cases, prophylaxis implies the need for a central venous access device, which must be maintained and used properly, and carries risks of infection and thrombosis. These risks, types of devices, and their proper care and use, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; The benefit of starting prophylaxis at as young an age as possible is balanced against the burdens of regular (two to three times per week) intravenous therapy in an infant. We generally advise patients with severe hemophilia (factor activity level &lt;1 percent) to start prophylaxis when they have significant bleeding such as a joint bleed or other bleeding that requires treatment with factor (but not for minor bruising or oral bleeding). This may be at approximately one year of age for some children and older for others. Some centers routinely start prophylaxis at 1 to 1.5 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another option for patients or families who place a higher value on avoiding or delaying factor infusions (or venous access device insertion) is to wait until it becomes clear whether the patient is going to have frequent bleeding episodes. This has the advantage of potentially avoiding factor infusions in patients with infrequent or no bleeding. However, there is a potential risk of life-threatening bleeding if prophylaxis is not given. Neither of these risks are predictable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefits of starting prophylaxis at a young age or soon after the first joint bleed have been shown in several studies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a 2017 analysis from a United States hemophilia treatment center surveillance registry that included over 6000 patients followed for approximately 12 years, normal joint mobility was preserved in those who started prophylaxis before age 4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The median age of first joint bleed in this study was 2.2 years, consistent with that seen in other studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H86820608\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Age at first bleeding'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a 1999 series of 121 patients who started prophylaxis at different ages, the frequency of developing arthropathy was less in those who started prophylaxis at age 0 to 2 years compared with those who started between ages 3 and 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The bleeding rate also decreased with shorter interval dosing (eg, less bleeding with dosing two times weekly [hemophilia B] or three time weekly [hemophilia A] compared with once weekly). In a subgroup of 55 patients who used a more intensive schedule (factor infusion three times weekly), there was no significant difference in bleeding rate between those who started prophylaxis before age 3 years or between 3 and 5 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, joint bleeding is not the only clinically important outcome. Studies to evaluate the benefit of prophylaxis in reducing other bleeding complications are ongoing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing schedule</strong> &ndash; The goal of dosing is to maintain the factor level above 1 to 2 percent, essentially converting the patient from a severe to a moderate hemophilia phenotype. Larger doses given less frequently will produce higher peaks; smaller doses given more frequently will provide more uniform factor levels but involve more venipuncture and handling of factor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dosing and monitoring schedule are highly dependent on the patient and which factor is deficient. Very young children may be able to tolerate a lower trough level (eg, 1 to 2 percent) than older children who are more active <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> demonstrate a severe bleeding pattern. The dosing schedule can be adjusted according to the patient's trough factor level, bleeding rate, and intravenous access. The presence of a central venous access device facilitates more frequent monitoring of trough levels, but this may not be required in all patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The following are examples of typical starting schedules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hemophilia A</strong> &ndash; Factor VIII, 25 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of body weight, given three times per week (Malmo protocol) or 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> three times per week (Utrecht protocol). If a longer lasting product is used, small children may start with once or twice per week dosing and work up to the optimal dosing and trough level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hemophilia B</strong> &ndash; Factor IX, 25 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of body weight, given two times per week (Malmo protocol) or 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> two times per week (Utrecht protocol). Longer lasting products allow for once per week or once every two week dosing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other schedules such as every other day are also used; it is important to consult the product information for the specific product being administered, and the patient's individual pharmacokinetics. Management of product choice and dosing schedule is optimally done through a hemophilia treatment center. It is preferable to give the factor in the morning so that levels will be higher during periods of activity rather than during sleep. The vial size closest to the calculated dose should be used to limit the number of vials required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For adults who have previously been receiving on-demand therapy and want to switch to prophylaxis, dosing is similar, although the typical amount of factor used during on-demand treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the circumstances in which bleeding was most likely to occur can also be incorporated into the dosing schedule (eg, dosing immediately before activities that previously were associated with bleeding, termed &quot;activity-based prophylaxis&quot;). Some adults with factor VIII deficiency may start with once weekly prophylaxis, which will significantly decrease bleeding and can acclimate them to the use of prophylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Flexibility in dosing schedules is supported by a 2012 trial that randomly assigned 66 patients with hemophilia A to receive standard dosing (20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> every other day) or adjusted dosing based on pharmacokinetic data (20 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> every third day) and found that the two arms were comparable in annualized bleeding rates, total factor usage, and adverse event rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The importance of an adequate trough factor activity level in reducing &quot;breakthrough&quot; bleeding was demonstrated in a study involving 143 children and adults with severe hemophilia A who were receiving routine prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The amount of time with trough factor VIII activity levels below 1, 2, and 5 percent were calculated from pharmacokinetic data and infusion records; this analysis showed that bleeding correlated strongly with lower trough levels, such that each hour spent with a factor VIII activity &lt;1 percent was associated with a 2.2 percent increase in annualized bleeding rate.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3524657932\"><span class=\"h3\">Can prophylaxis be discontinued?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once prophylaxis is started, a question may arise regarding whether or when the patient can or should be transitioned to on-demand treatment. The answer is highly patient-dependent, and we usually base our decisions on the symptoms being reported and the concerns of the patient. As an example, some adults may wish to switch to a less frequent regimen or have a trial off prophylaxis, with close observation of the effects on musculoskeletal symptoms and quality of life.</p><p>In a 2005 series that included 80 patients with severe hemophilia A or B who received prophylaxis during childhood, approximately one-third discontinued prophylaxis (median age of discontinuation, 21.5 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. At a median follow up of 3.5 years, the individuals who stopped prophylaxis had a slightly higher rate of joint bleeds (3.2 versus 1.8 per year) but an equivalent clinical outcome based on clinical examination score that included inflammation, deformity, and instability; and a radiologic (Pettersson) score. However, these radiologic scores lag behind clinical bleeding events. We inform patients that the risk of development of joint disease continues when prophylaxis is discontinued, as does the risk of intracranial or other life-threatening bleeding events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3159793108\"><span class=\"h2\">Available products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tables list available products for factor VIII (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109838 \">table 3</a>) and factor IX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109839 \">table 4</a>), which are described in the sections that follow.

Emicizumab may be especially useful in individuals for whom ITI is ineffective.

In monogenic disorders such as hemophilia, this may involve a wild-type factor gene or a modified gene with enhanced properties such as greater activity or longer half-life. Because the factor circulates in the bloodstream, the DNA can be transduced into any cells with access to the circulation. Hepatocytes are considered an ideal target cell for transduction because the liver is the site of synthesis of most clotting factors (endothelial cells for factor VIII; hepatocytes for factor IX).</p><p>Hemophilia is highly amenable to gene therapy; this is because production of even a small amount of the missing factor (eg, to raise the factor level from a baseline of 0 percent up to a level of 5 percent) may be sufficient to convert the disease from one of frequent potentially life-threatening bleeding into a mild bleeding disorder and may obviate the requirement for routine factor prophylaxis. Raising the factor level above 30 to 40 percent may be equivalent to curing the disease.</p><p>A variety of technologies may be used to introduce the gene for factor VIII or factor IX, either using ex vivo genetic modification followed by implantation of the modified cells, or direct injection of the vectors into the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/121-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-124</a>].

Reducing antithrombin levels has the potential to increase thrombin generation and clot formation when levels of factor VIII or factor IX are low. This approach initially appeared promising in a study in which patients with moderate to severe hemophilia A or B were treated with the investigational antithrombin ASO fitusiran; patients had fewer bleeding events when receiving the drug compared with the period before the drug was administered (mean annualized bleeding rate, 0 versus 3); this correlated with reduced antithrombin levels and the effect appeared to be dose-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].

The monthly regimen used in the study induced a dose-dependent reduction of antithrombin (mean maximum reduction, 70 to 89 percent from baseline). A reduction in the antithrombin level of more than 75 percent from baseline resulted in mean peak thrombin values at the lower end of the range seen in individuals without hemophilia.

Intermittent (short term, episodic) prophylaxis may be used in specific circumstances such as high-impact physical activities, joint bleeding, or surgical procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1194654088\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis versus on-demand therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large number replacement factor products are now available that can produce satisfactory hemostasis for hemophilia A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109838 \">table 3</a>) and hemophilia B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109839 \">table 4</a>). These include plasma-derived proteins, recombinant proteins, and recombinant proteins with modifications to extend half-life. For individuals with hemophilia A and an inhibitor, emicizumab is also an option. The choice among products is individualized and takes into account safety, purity, risk of inhibitor development, half-life, individual pharmacokinetics, and cost. We make every effort to obtain the best product for each patient, which may include providing the data and rationale to a third party payor. (See <a href=\"#H2042163077\" class=\"local\">'Choice of replacement product'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3159793108\" class=\"local\">'Available products'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe hemophilia, we advise starting prophylaxis either prior to or when there is significant bleeding, which may be at around one year of age for some children and older for others. Dosing is scheduled to maintain sustained, protective factor levels (eg, above 1 to 2 percent). Typical dosing schedules are listed above. (See <a href=\"#H512195504\" class=\"local\">'Age of initiation and dosing schedule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of prophylactic therapies other than replacement factor are under development, including a monoclonal antibody that substitutes for the function of activated factor VIII, and therapies that block the function of coagulation inhibitors. Development of gene therapy approaches also continues. (See <a href=\"#H709337\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic therapies under development'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate topic reviews discuss hemophilia A and B diagnosis, treatment of bleeding, perioperative management, management of age-related morbidities, inhibitor eradication, and genetics.
