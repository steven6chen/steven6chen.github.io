It is associated with about one-third of all infant deaths in the United States and accounts for approximately 45 percent of children with cerebral palsy (CP), 35 percent of children with vision impairment, and 25 percent of children with cognitive or hearing impairment.</p><p>Complications of prematurity are the underlying reasons for the higher rate of infant mortality and morbidity in preterm infants compared with full-term infants. The risk of complications increases with increasing immaturity. Thus, infants who are extremely preterm (EPT), born at or before 25 weeks gestation, have the highest mortality rate (about 50 percent) and if they survive, are at the greatest risk for long-term morbidity.</p><p>In preterm survivors, there is a high rate of long-term neurodevelopment impairment (NDI) and chronic health problems. These chronic medical and neurodevelopmental complications often require additional healthcare and educational services, which add to the overall economic cost of caring for the preterm infant.</p><p>The long-term complications of prematurity and the long-term healthcare needs of preterm survivors will be reviewed here.

In one study, adults (18 to 27 years of age) who were born prematurely (birth weights [BW] below 1500 g and a mean GA of 29 weeks) compared with term controls had higher blood pressure (BP) and impaired glucose regulation when evaluated by a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test with higher serum glucose and insulin concentrations two hours after glucose administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In addition, the ELBW group utilized services beyond those routinely required by children (65 versus 27 percent; OR 5.4, 95% CI 3.4-8.5), including acute care visits to healthcare professionals and special school arrangements or an individualized education program.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were observed in the previously mentioned Swedish study that reported that adolescents (age range 10 to 15 years) who were extremely preterm (gestational age [GA] 23 to 25 weeks) were more likely than term-born controls to have compensatory dependency needs (60 versus 29 percent; OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.2-6.6) and services above those routinely required by children (64 versus 25 percent; OR 5.4, 95% CI 3.0-9.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Moderately low birth weight (LBW) infants (birth weight [BW] between 1500 and 2499 g) are also more likely than normal BW infants to have special healthcare needs (eg, use of medical services <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medication), chronic conditions (eg, intellectual disability [mental retardation], CP, or asthma), learning disabilities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> attention deficit or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETAL COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If preterm delivery could be avoided, there would be tremendous savings to society worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/2,31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31-36</a>].

Government economic assistance was provided to 13 percent of individuals born at 24 to 28 weeks gestation and 6 percent born at 29 to 32 weeks gestation.

This included the costs of the medical care of the infants and mothers, and expenditures for the long-term care of patients born preterm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>England and Wales &ndash; Based upon 2006 estimates of the number of preterm births and the cost of medical care through the first 18 years of life in England and Wales, the total societal cost was estimated to be almost GBP &pound;3 billion (USD $4.6 billion) at 2006 prices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The mean incremental cost per child was about GBP &pound;23,000 (USD $35,500) and the cost increased with decreasing GA with estimated costs for a very preterm child of GBP &pound;62,000 (USD $96,000) and for an extremely preterm child GBP &pound;95,000 (USD $147,000).</p><p/><p>In addition, long-term morbidity is reduced when there is perinatal regionalization of care with maternal transport of women at risk to deliver a very low birth weight (VLBW) infant to a center that delivers a high volume of VLBW infants and provides level 3 neonatal care. This was illustrated in a cohort Finnish study that reported an increased risk of epilepsy and hyperkinetic disorders in VLBW survivors at five years of age who were cared for in a neonatal level 2 care facility compared with a level 3 center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and asthma was higher in survivors who had been transferred to a level 2 facility from a level 3 center.
