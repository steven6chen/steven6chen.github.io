It is characterized by small-vessel platelet-rich thrombi that cause thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). Some patients may have neurologic abnormalities, mild renal insufficiency, and low-grade fever. Most cases of TTP are acquired, caused by autoantibody inhibition of ADAMTS13 activity. Hereditary TTP, caused by <em>ADAMTS13 </em>gene mutations, is much less common.</p><p>This topic discusses our approach to the diagnosis and management of hereditary TTP.</p><p>Our general approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or related syndromes is presented in detail separately.

Both alleles of the <em>ADAMTS13</em> gene must be disrupted to cause deficiency severe enough to lead to the clinical syndrome of hereditary TTP. Either homozygous mutations or compound heterozygous mutations in <em>ADAMTS13</em> may be responsible. In contrast, individuals who are heterozygous for an <em>ADAMTS13</em> mutation (ie, only one allele affected) appear to be unaffected by conditions that can precipitate TTP episodes in patients with biallelic <em>ADAMTS13</em> defects.</p><p>A variety of mutations in <em>ADAMTS13</em> have been described, including insertions, deletions, missense and nonsense point mutations, and splice site mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These are cataloged by the Hereditary TTP Registry, which has enrolled over 140 patients and family members from 17 countries in America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Genotype-phenotype relationships were evaluated in a review of 38 Japanese families that included 69 different mutations in 43 patients, as well as in an analysis of 29 patients from Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Both of these studies demonstrated that genotypes associated with some residual ADAMTS13 activity were associated with less severe disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> later age of presentation than genotypes associated with absent ADAMTS13 activity. However, other factors may also modify disease phenotype (eg, physiologic stresses such as birth, pregnancy, infections; other unidentified genetic factors). A series of Norwegian families with hereditary TTP found variation in clinical severity and age at diagnosis in patients with the same ADAMTS13 genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2621342\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary TTP appears to be a very rare disorder. The Hereditary TTP Registry has estimated that there may be only 150 families worldwide, although this may be an underestimate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry (which includes any patient referred for a clinical suspicion of TTP or hemolytic uremic syndrome), representing a population base of 2 million people, we have identified one family in 26 years. Three daughters in this family have hereditary TTP, suggesting a prevalence of 1.5 patients per one million people. A population-based cross sectional study in Norway discovered an unexpectedly high prevalence, with 17 individuals affected per one million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In our overall experience, hereditary TTP represents less than 5 percent of all TTP cases; over 95 percent are acquired autoimmune TTP. However, among certain groups such as newborn infants and young children, hereditary TTP may be more common than acquired TTP. In pregnant women, hereditary TTP may represent up to one-fourth of TTP cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There do not appear to be any ethnic, racial, or geographic differences in the prevalence of hereditary TTP. Since hereditary TTP is an autosomal recessive trait with a rare gene frequency, some affected families may have a history of consanguinity, and the incidence of hereditary TTP may be greater in populations in which consanguinity is common.</p><p>There is no sex disparity among patients diagnosed in infancy or childhood; however, among patients diagnosed as adults, women are more frequently affected than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This difference is related to the risk of precipitating an acute episode of TTP during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H6053316\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2621349\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3956351\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute episode presenting features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hereditary TTP have similar presenting symptoms as those with acquired TTP during an acute episode, but hereditary TTP often presents during the newborn or childhood periods. Among adults, presentation during pregnancy is common. The defining features of an acute episode are thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) without an alternative explanation; additional features such as neurologic abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal insufficiency may also be present.</p><p>The spectrum of presenting findings and age of presentation was illustrated in a case series that included 43 patients from 38 families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The age of diagnosis extended from newborn infants to older adults, and misdiagnosis was common:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighteen patients (42 percent) presented at birth. This suggests that the newborn period represents a time of physiologic stress in this disease. Newborns may develop severe jaundice requiring exchange transfusion. Schistocytes may not be appreciated, because neonates have abnormal red blood cell morphology at baseline due to lack of fully developed splenic function. Among patients who presented in infancy or childhood, cases were evenly distributed between females and males.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seven patients (16 percent) were diagnosed as children. Some children had recurrent episodes of thrombocytopenia and were mistakenly thought to have immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighteen patients (42 percent) were diagnosed after 15 years of age. Of these, 15 (83 percent) were female; nine were pregnant at the time of presentation. The three males were diagnosed at age 51, 59, and 63 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients were initially misdiagnosed. Among those presenting as infants, only 4 of 18 patients had the correct diagnosis made within six months. Infants were often misdiagnosed as having neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia together with hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Children often were misdiagnosed as having ITP.</p><p/><p>The high frequency of diagnosis during pregnancy was also seen in a series of 42 women who presented with thrombocytopenia and MAHA during pregnancy and were found to have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Ten of these women (24 percent) were ultimately found to have hereditary TTP. (See <a href=\"#H6053316\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to the dramatic presentation of an acute episode of hereditary TTP, other patients may have clinical symptoms that suggest disease activity only in retrospect. In our experience, subtle neurologic symptoms such as headaches or episodes of loss of concentration have resolved following institution of prophylactic plasma exchange (PEX), suggesting that these were associated with ongoing disease activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3956357\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting laboratory findings in an acute episode of hereditary TTP always include thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), which is characterized by schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851 \">picture 1</a>); these findings are the same as in acquired TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). In patients with MAHA, there is evidence of hemolysis including increased indirect bilirubin, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and a negative direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT).</p><p>In hereditary TTP, the serum creatinine may be increased, similar to acquired TTP. ADAMTS13 testing shows severe deficiency without an inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H2621694\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), in hereditary TTP (and other primary TMAs), coagulation studies typically are normal, including the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and D-dimer. An exception may be a patient who develops DIC as a result of severe organ ischemia associated with TTP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2621363\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2621694\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143344\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute episode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of hereditary TTP should be considered in a patient with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), especially those who present at birth, in childhood, or during pregnancy. Patients are evaluated with ADAMTS13 activity measurement; ADAMTS13 inhibitor testing should be performed if activity is severely deficient. Additional testing includes laboratory studies to confirm MAHA (eg, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], Coombs testing) and a metabolic panel that includes serum creatinine.</p><p>Misdiagnosis often occurs because hereditary TTP is rare and thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemolytic anemia are attributed to other causes (eg, as immune thrombocytopenia). Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear for schistocytes is critical, with the caveat that abnormal red blood cell (RBC) morphology may be more common in neonates without TTP due to physiologic hyposplenism. In some cases, severe ADAMTS13 deficiency may be obscured by transfusion of any plasma-containing product (including plasma, RBC, or platelet transfusion) or plasma exchange. Therefore, it may be appropriate to retest ADAMTS13 activity following recovery for individuals strongly suspected of having hereditary TTP.</p><p>Patients with hereditary TTP have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency without a demonstrable inhibitor (autoantibody), which persists throughout their lives (ie, both during acute episodes and when asymptomatic). However, this information usually is not available at the onset of an acute episode, and appropriate treatment for an acute episode should not be delayed while awaiting test results, because a delay in appropriate therapy may be life threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143350\"><span class=\"h3\">After recovery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient has had an acute episode of MAHA and thrombocytopenia, associated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity &lt;10 percent) without an inhibitor, that responds promptly to plasma infusion, we repeat the ADAMTS13 activity measurement following recovery because the likelihood of hereditary TTP is high and the persistence of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency without an inhibitor is supportive, especially if symptoms occur in infancy, childhood, or pregnancy, or if the patient has a family member with TTP.</p><p>The likelihood of hereditary TTP is further increased in patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity &lt;10 percent) without a demonstrable inhibitor during remission on at least two occasions four weeks apart.</p><p>Molecular testing for <em>ADAMTS13</em> gene mutation(s) is the confirmatory test. Genetic analysis is available for patients in whom hereditary TTP is strongly suspected by these criteria at no cost through the Hereditary TTP (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome) Registry (<a href=\"http://www.ttpregistry.net/&amp;token=En5nyyINJXT42NSA/PvNRN68WwKwr2t1Q8ULniIzH4BCkYiZPJ0bIPERSQu3A2gz&amp;TOPIC_ID=7079\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ttpregistry.net</a>). For patients with biallelic <em>ADAMTS13 </em>mutations, the diagnosis is confirmed. For a rare patient with heterozygous <em>ADAMTS13</em> mutation, consultation with the Hereditary TTP Registry may be pursued to determine the explanation for severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. This testing may take days to weeks. As noted above, therapy for an acute episode should not be delayed while obtaining this testing. (See <a href=\"#H2621384\" class=\"local\">'Acute episode'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143356\"><span class=\"h3\">Unaffected siblings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of hereditary TTP should also be considered in family members of an individual with hereditary TTP. Evaluation of all siblings of an affected patient is appropriate regardless of whether symptoms have occurred. Patients may have hereditary TTP with absent ADAMTS13 activity and have apparently excellent health.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2621701\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of hereditary TTP is made in a new patient with an acute episode of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and severe ADAMTS13 deficiency without an inhibitor; especially in an infant, child, or pregnant woman.</p><p>In a family member of a patient with hereditary TTP, diagnosis is made based on severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity and biallelic <em>ADAMTS13</em> mutations; clinical symptoms and laboratory findings (thrombocytopenia, MAHA) are not required. An asymptomatic family member with heterozygous <em>ADAMTS13</em> mutation is considered to be unaffected. (See <a href=\"#H2621419\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling and testing of siblings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11243906\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of hereditary TTP includes other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) and other causes of thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemolytic anemia in infants and children.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired TTP</strong> &ndash; Acquired TTP is significantly more common than hereditary TTP, especially in adults. Like hereditary TTP, acquired TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia and MAHA without another explanation, and sometimes by neurologic symptoms or renal insufficiency. Like hereditary TTP, acquired TTP is caused by severely deficient activity of the von Willebrand factor protease ADAMTS13, (activity &lt;10 percent). Unlike hereditary TTP, acquired TTP is caused by an inhibitory autoantibody, and this is usually detected at the time of ADAMTS13 measurement. However, it is important to note that approximately 15 percent of patients with acquired, autoimmune TTP may not have a demonstrable functional inhibitor. The reasons for this are unclear. One postulated mechanism is that autoantibodies may enhance clearance of ADAMTS13 without blocking ADAMTS13 function. Unlike hereditary TTP, acquired TTP does not run in families. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other primary TMAs</strong> &ndash; Other primary TMAs include inherited and acquired syndromes. Hereditary syndromes include complement-mediated TMA (also described as complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS] and atypical HUS) and TMA due to defects in methylmalonic acid metabolism and regulators of the coagulation cascade, and these commonly present in infants or children. Shiga toxin HUS (also described as diarrheal HUS) may be the most common TMA syndrome in children. Like hereditary TTP, these syndromes present with thrombocytopenia and MAHA and may include neurologic symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> various degrees of renal insufficiency. Unlike hereditary and acquired TTP, other TMA syndromes do not have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity &lt;10 percent), although they may have mild deficiency due to acute illness.

Like hereditary TTP, these syndromes can be associated with thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia with microangiopathic changes on the peripheral blood smear. Unlike hereditary TTP, patients with these syndromes do not have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, and they require treatment of the underlying syndrome (which may include delivery) rather than plasma infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN)</strong> &ndash; HDFN results from maternal alloantibodies to fetal red blood cell (RBC) antigens, leading to neonatal hemolytic anemia of various severities. Rh(D) incompatibility between an Rh(D)-positive infant and an Rh(D)-negative mother is the typical etiology. Like hereditary TTP, infants may be acutely ill with hemolytic anemia and neonatal jaundice, and there may be a history of an affected sibling. Unlike hereditary TTP, infants with HDFN usually do not have thrombocytopenia, and their illness resolves with appropriate supportive care (eg, RBC transfusion, RBC exchange transfusion, hydration, phototherapy). Unlike hereditary TTP, patients with HDFN do not have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal diagnosis and management of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)</strong> &ndash; ITP is caused by autoantibodies to platelet antigens that result in platelet destruction and thrombocytopenia. Like hereditary TTP, ITP can present in childhood with severe thrombocytopenia. Unlike hereditary TTP, ITP is not typically associated with hemolytic anemia (unless part of an autoimmune disorder with multiple autoantibodies) and ITP does not cause renal or neurologic abnormalities (unless caused by bleeding, which is rare). Unlike hereditary TTP, ITP is not associated with microangiopathic changes on the peripheral blood smear, and ITP is not associated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency.

Like hereditary TTP, patients with Evans syndrome often present in childhood with hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Unlike hereditary TTP, Evans syndrome is not associated with microangiopathic changes on the peripheral blood smear, the anemia in Evans syndrome typically is direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT)-positive, and Evans syndrome is not associated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency.

Like hereditary TTP, patients may have thrombocytopenia, and siblings may be affected. Unlike TTP, patients with inherited platelet disorders do not have hemolytic anemia or ADAMTS13 deficiency.

This was illustrated in case reports from the era before the benefit of plasma infusion was appreciated, in which previously healthy individuals died from acute episodes of hereditary TTP. In the 1970s, we cared for two teenage sisters who presented during their first pregnancies, two years apart; both died of TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90490245\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasma infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principle of treating an acute episode in a patient with hereditary TTP is straightforward: plasma infusion to replace the deficient ADAMTS13 enzyme. Plasma exchange (PEX) is not required, because patients do not have an ADAMTS13 inhibitor that needs to be removed, although PEX will be effective in replacing ADAMTS13 if used due to suspicion of acquired TTP. A typical initial plasma dose is 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> which should provide an ADAMTS13 activity level of 25 to 37 percent, assuming a plasma volume of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>. We treat patients with this dose daily until the platelet count recovers to normal, which may require only one to three days of plasma infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The half-life of ADAMTS13 in the circulation is approximately 2.5 days.</p><p>The strength of our recommendation to use plasma infusion rather than PEX depends on the certainty that the patient has hereditary rather than acquired TTP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with known hereditary TTP who have an acute episode, we recommend plasma infusion rather than PEX.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain clinical scenarios are associated with a very high probability of hereditary TTP. For patients with TTP in these groups, we suggest plasma infusion rather than PEX. These scenarios include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A newborn infant with severe hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A child less than 10 years old who has a history of repeated episodes of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A family member of a patient with hereditary TTP who presents with an acute episode of TTP before having genetic testing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A patient who has had a previous episode of TTP that responded rapidly (within one to two days) to plasma infusion, with complete resolution of symptoms, thrombocytopenia, and MAHA; and normalization of ADAMTS13 activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all other individuals with a clinical presentation consistent with TTP and for whom an alternative diagnosis has not been made, we presume the diagnosis is acquired autoimmune TTP and treat accordingly with urgent PEX. This includes the majority of adults and pregnant women. The rationale is that hereditary TTP is very rare in adults (less than 5 percent of all TTP cases), plasma infusion is not sufficient therapy for acquired TTP, and delays in instituting PEX for an acute episode of acquired TTP may be life threatening. Details of management are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The ability to use plasma infusion rather than PEX for patients with confirmed hereditary TTP (or a strong suspicion of hereditary TTP) has important advantages, including avoidance of a central venous catheter and elimination of the need to mobilize the apheresis staff <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfer the patient to a facility capable of performing PEX. However, plasma infusion is not adequate treatment for acquired TTP. Thus, in patients for whom a reasonable possibility of acquired TTP remains, PEX is required. Of note, there is no role for plasmapheresis using a non-plasma replacement fluid for either hereditary TTP or acquired TTP.</p><p>As noted below and in a separate topic review, individuals who cannot accept plasma (eg, Jehovah's Witnesses) or do not tolerate plasma due to side effects may be treated with a plasma-derived <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viii-human-plasma-derived-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">factor VIII concentrate</a> (Koate DVI) that contains ADAMTS13.

If the platelet count is <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL,</span> it must be assumed that TTP is active and microvascular thrombosis is occurring; in such cases, plasma infusion to replace ADAMTS13 is required. In contrast to patients with acquired TTP, patients with hereditary TTP experience prompt, complete recovery following plasma infusion. Typically, the platelet count increases within one to two days of plasma infusion.</p><p>For patients whose disease responds completely and rapidly to plasma infusion, we continue to monitor the platelet count and pursue genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2621701\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with a presentation consistent with TTP whose disease does not respond rapidly to plasma infusion, we treat presumptively for acquired TTP, and we continue to evaluate for other possible diagnoses.

These patients may benefit from prophylactic plasma infusion, although the decision to use regular prophylactic plasma infusions requires considerable thought and discussion with the patient. For children, the family generally has significant input depending on the age of the child.

These include headache, especially if preceded by migraine aura; transient moments of loss of attention; or syncopal episodes. Measurement of the platelet count in a patient who experiences these symptoms may be helpful, especially if it is low, but even if the platelet count remains greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL,</span> symptoms attributable to TTP may occur and may resolve with plasma infusions. Thus, patients found to have thrombocytopenia or unexplained neurologic findings should be treated rapidly with plasma infusion. (See <a href=\"#H90490245\" class=\"local\">'Plasma infusion'</a> above.)</p><p>In the absence of symptoms, only routine medical care is required. A complete blood count (CBC) is only required when the patient has an illness (eg, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection) or any symptoms that may be attributable to TTP.</p><p>Planning for pregnancy should be a routine component of care for women of childbearing potential.

The traditional source of ADAMTS13 is plasma, which carries risks of transfusion reactions (eg, transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI], allergic reactions) and risks of transfusion-transmitted infection, which is extremely unlikely in the developed world but theoretically possible. Prophylactic plasma infusion also requires intravenous access and travel to a facility every other week, which may present a significant burden <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cost for some patients. Additionally, once the decision to use prophylaxis has been made, it is assumed that for most individuals this therapy will continue for life. Thus, the decision to initiate prophylactic plasma infusion relies heavily on patient values and preferences.</p><p>Once prophylactic plasma infusion has begun, the patient may notice changes that validate the decision. Energy and attentiveness may improve, or headaches may become less frequent or disappear. Improvement of quality of life provides the incentive to continue regular plasma infusions.</p><p>Our approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with hereditary TTP who have evidence of ongoing TTP activity (eg, occasional neurologic symptoms, frequent acute episodes), we suggest prophylactic plasma infusion. If symptoms resolve with this therapy, this provides additional evidence that the therapy is appropriate. If symptoms do not resolve, potential reasons should be evaluated, including an alternative or additional diagnosis, or insufficient plasma dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who become pregnant, we suggest prophylactic plasma infusion throughout the pregnancy, beginning as soon as the pregnancy is documented, and for six weeks postpartum, without waiting for an acute episode to develop. (See <a href=\"#H6053316\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic plasma infusion may also be appropriate for the following patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those undergoing surgical procedures, who experience trauma, or who are hospitalized or treated for an acute illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with frequent triggering events such as situations of physiologic stress or infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, such patients may elect to watch closely for symptoms and seek medical attention at the first sign of a TTP episode. These decisions are individualized based on the patient&rsquo;s history, degree of physiologic stress, prior episodes, values, and preferences. Those who use routine prophylactic infusions may elect to discontinue them if the frequency of triggering events diminishes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals who have never had an acute episode (eg, individuals diagnosed by genetic testing of a family member) and are not experiencing a potential triggering event such as pregnancy, we suggest not using prophylactic plasma infusion. It may also be appropriate not to use prophylactic plasma infusion for those who have only had one TTP episode with a clear and obvious trigger (eg, birth, severe illness), and those who prefer to avoid the harms and burdens associated with plasma infusion (see <a href=\"#H933282\" class=\"local\">'Complications of plasma infusion'</a> below). Close monitoring for symptoms of disease activity continues to be important for these individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not known if patients with hereditary TTP are at increased risk for premature vascular diseases. The antithrombotic role of ADAMTS13 and its function in enhancing revascularization suggest that hereditary TTP could be a risk factor for premature cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or kidney disorders.</p><p/><p>Prophylactic plasma infusion consists of administration of plasma at a dose 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> every two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In an average sized adult, this is equivalent to two to three units of plasma (approximately 500 to 750 mL). The dose for adults may be rounded to the nearest unit of plasma (ie, we do not discard unused plasma in order to administer an exact dose).</p><p>Dosing and dose changes are guided by symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> platelet count rather than ADAMTS13 activity, because symptoms (and platelet count) are the most reliable and direct measure of disease activity. The interval is based on the half-life of ADAMTS13 of 2.5 days. Individuals who experience symptoms with this schedule may benefit from increasing the dose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shortening the interval between doses. While we do not measure ADAMTS13 activity routinely, it may be useful in selected patients in whom it is unclear whether symptoms are due to TTP, or in a research setting. In such cases, it is presumed that activity should be maintained at &gt;10 percent, based on observations with acquired TTP.</p><p>There are no randomized trials of prophylactic plasma infusion; our practice is based on our clinical experience and case reports showing rapid and complete resolution of hereditary TTP episodes with plasma infusion, observation of permanent morbidities (eg, stroke, renal failure) in patients who continue to have episodes or have untreated episodes, and the biologic rationale that hereditary TTP disease activity can be abolished by providing the ADAMTS13 protease. In a series of 17 Norwegian families with hereditary TTP, the majority were treated effectively with prophylactic plasma infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The prevention of recurrences may become more straightforward <span class=\"nowrap\">if/when</span> recombinant ADAMTS13 becomes available.

Pregnancy is an especially strong trigger for an initial or recurrent episode of hereditary TTP, and it must be appreciated that pregnancy can cause maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, in our experience and the experience of others, many women have had successful pregnancies when treated with appropriate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>TTP disease activity may occur during any stage of pregnancy, with the greatest risk during the second and third trimesters. Therefore, for all patients with hereditary TTP who become pregnant, we suggest initiating prophylactic plasma infusion without delay, as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. The dose and frequency of plasma infusion during pregnancy is guided by the platelet count, which is measured at every prenatal visit. We start with infusion of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> every two weeks. If the platelet count decreases to less than <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL,</span> as it often does in the second or third trimester, then the dose of plasma is increased to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg;</span> the frequency may also need to be increased to once weekly if the platelet count continues to drop between infusions of plasma.</p><p>For postpartum patients, we suggest continuing prophylactic plasma infusion every two weeks for a total of six weeks postpartum, when we are more confident that the risk of an episode has returned to baseline. Patients may breastfeed their infants during these six weeks of plasma infusion.</p><p>Although data are lacking for hereditary TTP, we presume women with hereditary TTP are at increased risk of preeclampsia, similar to women with acquired TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The management of an acute episode of hereditary TTP during pregnancy, including patients for whom the pregnancy is their initial presentation, is the same as for nonpregnant patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat with plasma infusion if there is confidence in the diagnosis of hereditary TTP (versus acquired TTP or other primary thrombotic microangiopathy). (See <a href=\"#H2621384\" class=\"local\">'Acute episode'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat with plasma exchange if there is a reasonable possibility of acquired autoimmune TTP.

If prophylactic plasma infusion does not result in normalization of the platelet count within one to two days, there is likely to be another reason for the patient&rsquo;s thrombocytopenia (or symptoms). Possible alternative or additional diagnoses are discussed separately.

We test all siblings as soon as the index case is identified because symptoms (including life-threatening thrombocytopenia or neurologic abnormalities) commonly occur in childhood.</p><p>Patients with hereditary TTP are counseled that the likelihood of their own children being affected with hereditary TTP is exceedingly low, due to the extreme rarity of <em>ADAMTS13</em> mutations in the general population. In contrast to more common autosomal recessive disorders, we do not test the partner for an <em>ADAMTS13</em> gene mutation.</p><p>We also do not test parents or children of an individual with hereditary TTP for heterozygosity for an <em>ADAMTS13 </em>mutation outside of a research study.

Recombinant ADAMTS13 is thus a promising therapy for hereditary TTP. In a prospective study involving 15 individuals with hereditary TTP, recombinant ADAMTS13 produced in a mammalian cell culture system (Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] cells) was well tolerated and did not cause serious adverse events or development of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This study (and earlier preclinical studies) demonstrated that recombinant ADAMTS13 cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) and reduces ultralarge VWF multimers; recombinant ADAMTS13 abrogated symptoms in a mouse model of TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Patients have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (typically, undetectable activity) without an autoantibody inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H2621321\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2621328\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary TTP represents &lt;5 percent of all TTP cases but may be more common than acquired autoimmune TTP in certain groups such as infants or young children.

This includes newborns, children &lt;10 years of age with repeated episodes of thrombocytopenia and MAHA, symptomatic family members of patients with hereditary TTP, and patients with a prior episode of TTP that responded rapidly to plasma infusion. (See <a href=\"#H90490245\" class=\"local\">'Plasma infusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Management of patients with an acute episode of TTP who are not in one of these groups with a high probability of hereditary TTP (and thus who are likely to have acquired TTP) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with hereditary TTP experience prompt, complete recovery following plasma infusion; typically, the platelet count increases within one to two days. In individuals with a presumptive diagnosis of hereditary TTP, a rapid increase in the platelet count is supportive of the diagnosis. If the platelet count does not increase rapidly, the patient should be treated with PEX and evaluated for the possibility of acquired TTP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other causes of thrombocytopenia and MAHA. (See <a href=\"#H2621680\" class=\"local\">'Expected recovery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11243906\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with hereditary TTP who have recovered from an acute episode, the decision to initiate prophylactic plasma infusion to prevent recurrent acute episodes depends on the disease activity. Individual values and preferences also play a large role. (See <a href=\"#H2621391\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrences'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those who have evidence of ongoing TTP activity (eg, occasional neurologic symptoms, frequent acute episodes), we suggest using regular prophylactic plasma infusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all patients with hereditary TTP who become pregnant, we suggest initiating prophylactic plasma infusion without delay, rather than waiting for an acute episode to develop (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The dose and frequency is guided by the platelet count, which is measured at every prenatal visit. For postpartum patients, we suggest continuing prophylactic plasma infusion every two weeks for a total of six weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment of an acute episode of hereditary TTP during pregnancy is the same as in nonpregnant individuals. Delivery is only appropriate for obstetrical reasons. (See <a href=\"#H6053316\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prophylactic plasma infusion may also be used for a limited period of time in settings where disease activity is likely to increase, such as for patients undergoing surgical procedures, trauma, hospitalization, or treatment for an acute illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For individuals who have never had an acute episode (eg, siblings diagnosed through genetic testing of family members), we suggest not using prophylactic plasma infusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An exception may be an individual who places an extremely high value on avoiding an acute episode, for whom prophylactic plasma infusion may be appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For individuals with less frequent episodes (eg, one or two episodes in several years), decisions are individualized. Those who place a higher value on avoiding acute episodes may choose prophylactic plasma infusion, whereas those who prefer to avoid the burdens and harms of regular plasma infusion (see <a href=\"#H933282\" class=\"local\">'Complications of plasma infusion'</a> above) may choose not to use prophylactic plasma infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We test all siblings of an individual with hereditary TTP as soon as the index case is identified. We do not test parents or children of an affected individual (unless there is suspicion of consanguinity) or unless the testing is part of a study. (See <a href=\"#H2621419\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling and testing of siblings'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fujimura Y, Matsumoto M, Isonishi A, et al.
