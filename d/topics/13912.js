Seizures that occur early versus late after TBI have different implications for prognosis and management. Early seizures are felt to be acute symptomatic events with a low likelihood of recurrence, whereas late seizures represent epilepsy.</p><p>While only 4 percent of all epilepsy cases are attributed to trauma, 13 percent of those cases that are of known cause are post-traumatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. TBI is also the most important cause of symptomatic epilepsy in persons aged 15 to 24 years. Post-traumatic epilepsy contributes significantly to the functional disability in a TBI survivor.</p><p>This topic will discuss epidemiologic, clinical, management and prognostic issues that are specific to post-traumatic seizures. More general issues related to seizures and epilepsy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY SEIZURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early post-traumatic seizures are defined by their occurrence within one week of head trauma. These are acute symptomatic events and are not felt to represent epilepsy.</p><p>A distinct category of immediate seizures, those occurring upon or within seconds of impact, is controversial. Some feel that these are &quot;convulsive concussions&quot; and not epileptic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; others include them in the category of early seizures because of their similar associated risk for post-traumatic epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, the incidence of early post-traumatic seizures is about 6 to 10 percent but may be as high as 20 to 25 percent in some groups, such as those with depressed skull fracture and intracerebral hematoma requiring evacuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Early seizure rates are also higher in patients with more severe head injuries, subdural hematomas, and penetrating head injury, but they do occur in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and normal head CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8</a>].</p><p>Younger children are at higher risk for early post-traumatic seizures than adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In one series of patients, 31 percent of children younger than seven years had early seizures compared with 20 percent of children aged 8 to 16 years and 8.4 percent of children over 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a larger series of more than 2000 children with severe TBI, the overall risk of early post-traumatic seizures was 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most important risk factors for early seizure were age less than two years, injury by abuse or assault, and subdural hemorrhage. In the presence of all three of these characteristics, the estimated probability of seizure was 60 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About one-half of early post-traumatic seizures occur during the first 24 hours, and one-quarter occur within the first hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Most seizures (72 to 84 percent) presenting within the first day are generalized tonic clonic type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]. The later a seizure begins in relationship to the head injury, the more likely it will be focal in onset; after the first day, more than half are either simple partial (pure motor) seizures or focal with secondary generalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>]. Complex partial seizures are rare in this setting.</p><p>About 10 percent of patients with acute head injury develop status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>]. This is more common in children and usually accompanies other underlying complications such as ischemia or metabolic imbalance. Focal motor status epilepticus is most common with subdural hematoma or depressed skull fracture and may be refractory to treatment. Mortality with generalized status epilepticus is high even when associated with mild TBI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with moderate and severe TBI routinely have a head CT as part of their injury evaluation. Head CT is also required in patients with early post-traumatic seizures after a mild TBI; early seizures are associated with a higher incidence of intracranial bleeding, which may in turn increase the risk of short and long-term complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>). While brain MRI is more sensitive for post-traumatic intracranial abnormalities, the implications of this added information for prognosis and management are less clear.</p><p>EEG has limited utility in this setting. EEG abnormalities do not predict the risk or type of seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. EEG patterns are often nonspecifically altered during the acute phase of head injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although early post-traumatic seizures may not recur, patients with early seizures are often treated with antiseizure drugs because of the risk of status epilepticus or aggravation of a systemic injury. In addition, recurrent seizures may increase cerebral blood flow and could theoretically increase intracranial pressure.</p><p>There is no ideal antiseizure drug for the management of early seizures. In practice, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a></span> is often used because it does not cause significant sedation and can be loaded intravenously; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> is a reasonable alternative. The optimal duration of therapy is not clear and depends in part upon the severity of injury. Antiseizure drugs are generally continued throughout the hospital stay and are gradually withdrawn within the first few weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>In patients who have not had a seizure but appear to be at increased risk for early seizures (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above), antiseizure drug treatment reduces the incidence of early seizures and may be used because of similar concerns for secondary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. Pooled analysis of two randomized trials found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> prophylaxis reduced the risk of early post-traumatic seizures compared with placebo (relative risk 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another randomized trial found that prophylactic treatment with either phenytoin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> was associated with similarly low rates of early post-traumatic seizures (1.5 percent) and adverse drug reactions (8 to 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In unselected patients, the risk of early post-traumatic seizures is low and is not substantially reduced by treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The use of antiseizure drugs after head injury does not reduce the risk of late seizures or post-traumatic epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with early seizures are at higher risk for the development of post-traumatic epilepsy compared with those who do not have early seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Some investigators believe that immediate seizures or &quot;concussive convulsions&quot; are more benign in terms of their risk for long-term seizures. In one study of 22 Australian rugby players with this phenomenon, none developed epilepsy over a mean follow-up of 3.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Others have found a more similar prognosis for immediate seizures and all early seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/3,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20,21</a>].</p><p>It is possible that the association between early and late seizures reflects the shared risk factors for early and late seizures or that early seizures represent an independent risk factor for epilepsy. Multivariate analysis has given somewhat conflicting results. One population-based cohort study of 4541 adults and children with head injury followed for &gt;20 years did not find early seizures to be an independent risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a pooled analysis of a selected group of 783 high-risk trauma patients followed for two years as part of a clinical trial, early seizures remained in the multivariate analysis as an independent risk factor for epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Alcohol withdrawal is a common cause of both early and late-onset seizures in patients with head trauma, regardless of the severity of head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-TRAUMATIC EPILEPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures occurring more than one week after head injury reflect more permanent structural and physiologic changes within the brain and usually represent the onset of post-traumatic epilepsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 10-year incidence of epilepsy after traumatic brain injury (TBI) of any severity is estimated at about 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The severity of TBI strongly correlates with risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25-29</a>]. In one population-based cohort, the cumulative five-year probability of seizures was 0.5 percent in patients with mild injury (those with loss of consciousness or amnesia &lt;30 minutes); 1.2 percent for those with moderate injuries (loss of consciousness for 30 minutes to 24 hours or skull fracture); and 10.0 percent in those with severe injuries (loss of consciousness or amnesia for more than 24 hours or subdural hematoma or cerebral contusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another study of 647 hospitalized patients categorized TBI severity more traditionally with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The two-year incidence of epilepsy was 8.0 percent for GCS 13 to 15 and 16.8 percent for GCS 3 to 8.</p><p>Other subsets of patients at much higher risk have been identified and include those with early seizures, intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral contusion, depressed skull fracture, and penetrating head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5,6,10,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,10,28,29</a>]. Any alcohol-related head injury, even when classified as mild, is a significant predictor of new-onset seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. TBI associated with intracranial lesions on CT was associated with an 18 percent risk of late seizures in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In penetrating missile combat injuries, the incidence is more than 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/13,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30</a>]. The requirement for neurosurgical procedure (hemorrhage evacuation, ventriculostomy) increased the risk, and multiple surgeries increased the risk over single surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In contrast to early seizures, older age, &gt;65 years, is a risk factor for post-traumatic epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Post-traumatic epilepsy is less common in the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. In one large, population-based study, the risk of post-traumatic epilepsy was slightly higher in women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; in another, men were at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Genetic factors may influence the risk of developing seizures after epilepsy. Most studies have not found an increased risk of epilepsy among family members of patients with post-traumatic epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, one large, population-based cohort found that a family history of epilepsy increased the risk of post-traumatic epilepsy, with a relative risk estimate roughly equivalent to what would have been predicted from an additive risk model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-traumatic seizures may be associated with the typical pathological changes that are seen in brain injuries including reactive gliosis, axon retraction balls, Wallerian degeneration, microglial scar formation, and cystic white matter lesions. There is also evidence suggesting that post-traumatic seizures may be a result of alterations of intrinsic membrane properties of pyramidal neurons together with enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate synaptic conductances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p>Selective damage to the hilar region of the hippocampus is produced in animal models after fluid-percussion traumatic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. While this pattern of injury appears more restricted than the hippocampal sclerosis associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, some speculate that this mechanism may contribute to the development of post-traumatic epilepsy in some cases. In one pathologic case series, a similar pattern of hippocampal injury was found in all of the 21 patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for post-traumatic epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>When a contusion or cortical laceration is present, the breakdown of hemoglobin releases iron. Based on animal and cell culture studies, iron may increase intracellular calcium oscillation. It may also increase free radical formation through activation of the arachidonic acid cascade thereby producing increased intracellular calcium and resulting in excitotoxic damage, neuronal death, and glial scarring, which lead to epileptiform activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. These findings suggest a possible role for neuroprotective treatment in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>MRI studies have the potential to add to our understanding of epileptogenesis after head injury. One study of 17 patients with post-traumatic epilepsy found that the presence of gadolinium enhancement was more common than in individuals with head trauma without epilepsy (77 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Depending on the timing of the MRI, however, this finding may represent the effect rather than the cause of seizures. Using a specialized technique, diffusion tensor imaging, investigators have demonstrated that MRI characteristics associated with glial proliferation are more pronounced in head-injured patients with, rather than without, epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In another study, in 135 patients with serial MRI examinations after TBI, hemosiderin deposits in the parenchyma associated with either incomplete or delayed surrounding gliosis were associated with the development of epilepsy compared with early hemosiderin completely surrounded by gliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 40 percent of individuals with post-traumatic epilepsy have onset within six months; 50 percent within one year; and about 80 percent within two years of head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/7,13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,24</a>]. Post-traumatic epilepsy may begin more than 15 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/12,22,25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22,25,28</a>]. The more severe the head injury, the longer the patient is at risk for late seizures; patients with mild TBI remain at risk for about five years, moderate TBI for 10 years, and severe TBI for 20 years or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The primary site of injury contributes to the symptomatic manifestation of epilepsy. Epilepsy appears earliest after lesions in the motor area followed by temporal lobe lesions and those in the frontal or occipital lobes. These seizures are usually secondarily generalized with or without apparent focal onset in 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/26,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,42</a>]. Simple and complex partial seizures each account for 10 to 20 percent. Primary generalized epilepsy has not been documented after head injury.</p><p>Not all post-traumatic seizures are unprovoked. In one population-based cohort, there was a higher than expected incidence of alcohol withdrawal seizures, presumably a result of the relationship between alcohol ingestion and the risk of TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another cohort study, nearly half all new-onset seizures following head trauma were alcohol related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis and diagnostic approach to a patient with first late seizure is similar to the evaluation of any patient with a first seizure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a>). If there is a history of TBI within the past two years, particularly one associated with risk factors for epilepsy, then the diagnostic evaluation for underlying etiology may be curtailed. As an example, if a patient has a seizure with partial onset that corresponds to the site of brain injury, and has no fever or unexplained abnormalities on examination, then it may be reasonable to limit the evaluation to a neuroimaging study (CT or MRI) and basic laboratories (chemistries and toxicology screen). If the trauma history is more remote, or the injury mild, then an association between the seizure and trauma may be less clear, and a thorough evaluation should be completed.</p><p>Brain MRI may be useful in ruling out other causes of epilepsy, but like EEG, it has no specific value in predicting either the development or remission of post-traumatic epilepsy. In patients whose seizures seem intractable to treatment or atypical of epilepsy, evaluation with video EEG can be helpful to rule out nonepileptic pseudoseizures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video and ambulatory EEG monitoring in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>). In one center, 24 percent of patients with confirmed nonepileptic seizures had a history of head trauma and a diagnosis of presumed post-traumatic epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Management and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrence of seizures without treatment is likely, as high as 86 percent in the first two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. As a result, long-term anticonvulsant treatment is recommended for patients after an initial late seizure. An antiseizure drug active in partial epilepsy should be selected according to the considerations of age and comorbidity that apply to other individuals with new-onset epilepsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The remission rate for post-traumatic epilepsy is about 25 to 40 percent with initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The event rate in the first year is predictive of the future course; patients having frequent seizures in the first year are less likely to have seizure remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Some will be refractory to treatment; over 13 percent of patients in the treatment groups of prophylactic antiseizure drug trials had seizures despite aggressive treatment regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/6,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,44</a>]. Surgical therapy may be an option for some of these patients.

Limitations in study design and execution of these trials, including delayed treatment, low power, primary use of older drugs with anticonvulsant rather than antiseizure properties, and suboptimal dosing, may have contributed to the lack of demonstrated benefit in the prevention of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, the failure to reduce the incidence of post-traumatic epilepsy is similar to the results of efforts to limit epileptogenesis in other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Because of the absence of proven benefit for prophylactic antiseizure drug therapy for the prevention of post-traumatic epilepsy and the known risk of the adverse effects of these medications, they are not recommended for this purpose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1614176221\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-term use of antiseizure drugs is recommended for the prevention of early seizures in patients who are at high risk and in whom seizures present a threat because of elevated intracranial pressure, systemic injury, or other reason (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures that occur after one week of TBI are likely to represent epilepsy. Except for age, late seizures share similar risk factors with early seizures. Post-traumatic epilepsy is more common in the elderly and relatively unusual in children. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A neuroimaging study (CT or MRI) is indicated for all patients with a new seizure. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the high rate of recurrence, long-term treatment with antiseizure drugs is recommended after a first late post-traumatic seizure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Management and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have NOT had a late post-traumatic seizure, we suggest <strong>NOT</strong> using antiseizure drugs to prevent late seizures or post-traumatic epilepsy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). There is a lack of demonstrated efficacy in this setting and many potential adverse events with these medications.
