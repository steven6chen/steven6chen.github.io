Inflammatory polyps include inflammatory pseudopolyps, prolapse type inflammatory polyps, and myoglandular polyps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4218838688\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory pseudopolyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory pseudopolyps are irregularly shaped islands of residual intact colonic mucosa that are the result of the mucosal ulceration and regeneration that occurs in response to localized or diffuse inflammation (eg, ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endoscopic features and histology</strong> &ndash; Inflammatory polyps may be pedunculated or sessile and are usually smaller than 2 cm. Inflammatory pseudopolyps in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are typically multiple, often filiform, and scattered throughout the involved areas of the colon. They may also be more isolated and semipedunculated in areas of recent inflammation, and have mucus adherent to their apices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76729\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76729 \">picture 1</a>). Inflammatory pseudopolyps are composed of a mixture of inflamed lamina propria and distorted colonic epithelium; surface erosions may or may not be present. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of malignancy</strong> &ndash; Inflammatory pseudopolyps do not undergo neoplastic transformation. However, they may be associated with surrounding dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Careful attention to the region being biopsied is particularly important when pseudopolyps are present in clusters.

This results in localized ischemia and lamina propria fibrosis. The classic histologic features of prolapse-induced inflammatory polyps include varying degrees of fibromuscular hyperplasia of the lamina propria, extension of the muscularis mucosae into the lamina propria, crypt elongation, hyperplasia, architectural distortion, and serration. Polyps may be associated with inflammation, ulceration, and reactive epithelial change. Based on the anatomic location of the injury and the underlying cause, these polyps are termed inflammatory cloacogenic polyps of the anal transitional zone, colitis cystica profunda, diverticular disease&ndash;associated polyps, or inflammatory cap polyps. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment unless symptoms develop. In symptomatic patients, we perform endoscopic polypectomy. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of inflammatory cap polyposis are discussed in detail separately.

Juvenile polyps can be diagnosed at any age, although they are relatively more common in childhood. Sporadic juvenile polyps of the colon occur in up to 2 percent of children under the age of 10 years, are usually solitary, and are not associated with an increased colorectal cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-polyps/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Isolated juvenile polyps are most common in the rectosigmoid colon but can occur in the proximal colon. Juvenile polyps resulting in lower gastrointestinal bleeding or prolapse through the rectum require polypectomy. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment. </p><p>Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by multiple hamartomatous polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Individuals with JPS are at increased risk for colorectal and gastric cancer. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of JPS is discussed in detail separately.

These polyps demonstrate a distinctive, arborizing pattern of smooth muscle derived from the underlying muscularis mucosa. The Peutz-Jeghers polyp is usually, but not always, associated with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), due to <em>STK11</em> mutations. Peutz-Jegher polyps should be resected. </p><p>The polyps are usually benign, but may grow progressively and produce symptoms or undergo malignant transformation. Patients with PJS are at increased risk of both gastrointestinal (gastric, small bowel, colon, pancreas) and nongastrointestinal cancers. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of PJS are discussed separately.

Cronkhite-Canada syndrome may be immune-mediated since it may respond to immunosuppressive therapy and, in some patients, immunostaining of the polyps for IgG4 is positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-polyps/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The classification of serrated polyps is evolving and there is significant variability in the histological classification of these lesions among pathologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-polyps/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H695577522\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperplastic polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperplastic polyps are the most common non-neoplastic polyps in the colon. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endoscopic features and histology</strong> &ndash; Hyperplastic polyps have an endoscopic appearance of small nodules or polypoid lesions. They are typically located in the rectosigmoid and are less than 5 mm in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-polyps/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hyperplastic polyps are serrated polyps with normal architecture and proliferative characteristics. They are composed of normal cellular components, do not exhibit dysplasia, and have a characteristic serrated (&quot;saw tooth&quot;) pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59446\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59446 \">picture 5</a>). Proliferation is mainly in the basal portion of the crypt of hyperplastic polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-polyps/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Three histologic subtypes of hyperplastic polyps have been described (microvesicular, goblet cell, and mucin depleted), but the clinical significance of this distinction is not clear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of cancer</strong> &ndash; Small rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps do not appear to increase the risk of colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-polyps/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. It is also unclear if small distal hyperplastic polyps are associated with an increased risk of proximal neoplasia and, even if it is, the magnitude of risk appears to be small. A systematic review that included 18 studies estimated that 21 to 25 percent of patients found to have a distal hyperplastic polyp had a proximal neoplasm (including 4 to 5 percent with an advanced neoplasm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-polyps/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the four studies in which a colonoscopy was performed irrespective of distal findings, the relative risk of any proximal neoplasia (advanced or not) was 1.3 (95% CI 0.9-1.8). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests for screening for colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Follow-up of positive sigmoidoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although some studies have suggested that serrated lesions that are larger or proximal may be associated with an increased risk of synchronous advanced neoplasia, these studies included hyperplastic polyps and SSPs and sessile serrated adenomas (SSA). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong> &ndash; Small hyperplastic polyps are typically biopsied or removed in the process of endoscopy with biopsy forceps because they can be difficult to distinguish from adenomatous polyps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66254\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66254 \">picture 6</a>). Although small left-sided hyperplastic polyps are not a significant marker of colon cancer risk, the biologic characteristics and natural history of large hyperplastic polyps, particularly the microvesicular type, are not well understood. Large lesions that contain some histologic features of a SSP, particularly when located in the right colon, should be resected in entirety.

In other countries, no further colonoscopies are recommended due to the lack of metachronous neoplasia risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86494 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colon-polyps/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Many pathologists nominate serrated polyps in the proximal colon as SSPs, diagnosing hyperplastic polyps only in the distal colon. The metachronous neoplasia risk of large polyps, especially in the proximal, now mostly diagnosed as sessile serrated polyps (with or without dysplasia), is unclear and should be managed according to as <span class=\"nowrap\">SSA/P</span>.

These polyps have a smooth surface, are often flat or sessile, and may be covered with mucus.

Polyps are usually asymptomatic but may ulcerate and bleed, cause tenesmus if in the rectum, and, when very large, produce intestinal obstruction. Colonic polyps may be neoplastic (eg, adenomas) or non-neoplastic (eg, inflammatory polyps). (See <a href=\"#H2397776595\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory polyps are non-neoplastic intraluminal projections of mucosa consisting of stromal and epithelial components and inflammatory cells. Inflammatory polyps do not undergo neoplastic transformation and do not require excision unless they cause symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2001083128\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hamartomatous polyps are made up of tissue elements that are normally found at that site but are growing in a disorganized mass. Juvenile polyps and Peutz-Jeghers polyps are hamartomatous polyps. In contrast to patients with sporadic juvenile polyps, patients with juvenile polyposis coli and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) are at increased risk for colorectal cancer. (See <a href=\"#H578092894\" class=\"local\">'Hamartomatous polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serrated polyps are a heterogenous group of polyps with variable malignant potential. They include hyperplastic polyps, traditional serrated adenomas, and sessile serrated polyps (SSPs; synonymous with sessile serrated adenomas [SSA]). (See <a href=\"#H2385438384\" class=\"local\">'Serrated polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperplastic polyps are the most prevalent non-neoplastic polyps in the colon. Distal small hyperplastic polyps rarely, if ever, develop into colorectal cancers. SSPs, particularly those with foci of classic histologic dysplasia, are considered the likely precursor lesions to sporadic high microsatellite instability&nbsp;(MSI-H) colon cancer through a molecular pathway characterized by a high frequency of methylation of some CpG islands (CpG island hypermethylation phenotype [CIMP]-positive). (See <a href=\"#H2385438384\" class=\"local\">'Serrated polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenomatous polyps are neoplastic polyps. Clinically, adenomas are generally asymptomatic and are most often detected by colon cancer screening tests. Villous histology, increasing polyp size, and high-grade dysplasia are risk factors for focal cancer within an individual adenoma. (See <a href=\"#H3209737681\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a polyp is detected, we recommend colonoscopy to establish the histology, remove the polyp, and search for synchronous lesions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Recommendations for subsequent treatment and surveillance depend on the number and pathologic features of the polyp(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86494 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3731328786\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Dr. Dennis J.
