The prognosis and treatment of MSA is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other forms of parkinsonism are discussed elsewhere.

Orthostatic hypotension as a manifestation of autonomic failure was described in 1925 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 1960, Shy and Drager reported patients with autonomic features of orthostatic syncope, impotence, and bladder dysfunction who went on to develop gait abnormalities, tremor, and fasciculations among other symptoms and signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This disorder became known as the Shy-Drager syndrome.</p><p>Also in 1960, the first cases were reported of a predominantly asymmetric parkinsonian syndrome manifested primarily by akinesia and rigidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The authors suggested that striatonigral degeneration was the pathologic correlate for these cases.</p><p>In 1969, the term &quot;multiple system atrophy&quot; was introduced to encompass all three clinical syndromes: olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Shy-Drager syndrome, and striatonigral degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Striatonigral degeneration was later redefined as MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), while olivopontocerebellar atrophy was redefined as MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When autonomic failure predominates, the term Shy-Drager syndrome may be used.</p><p>The discovery that glial cytoplasmic inclusions with alpha synuclein as a major component are the pathologic hallmark of the three clinical syndromes confirmed the suspicion that they were actually different manifestations of the same disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Beginning in the 1990s, consensus groups developed guidelines to define MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated annual incidence of MSA in the population &gt;50 years old is approximately 3 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The estimated prevalence of MSA is between 2 to 5 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 433 pathologically proven cases of MSA, the mean age of onset was 54 years (range 31 to 78) (younger than Parkinson disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similarly, European registry studies have reported onset at a mean age of 56 to 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. In these registries, MSA affects men and women about equally. However, other studies have reported that men are affected two to nine times more often than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. This finding may be secondary to earlier recognition of impotence as a major diagnostic feature in men. There is no specific racial predilection, and the disease has been reported in Caucasian, African, and Asian populations.</p><p>Although MSA is considered a sporadic disease, there are several reports of rare patients with probable or possible familial MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>There are no established environmental risk factors for MSA, but data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As examples, one small case-control study found that patients with MSA had significantly more potential exposures to metals, plastics, organic solvents, and pesticides than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], while another case-control study found that MSA was not associated with exposure to pesticides, organic solvents, or other toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main clinical features of MSA are akinetic-rigid parkinsonism, autonomic failure including urogenital dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal signs in varying combinations. The onset of disease is marked by the initial clinical manifestation of any of its characteristic motor or autonomic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, the neuropathologic changes probably begin several years before the disease becomes symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The motor presentations of MSA are classified into two separate but overlapping clinical subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) subtype</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C) subtype</p><p/><p>In most studies from Europe and North America, cases of MSA-P outnumber MSA-C by between two and four to one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]. This contrasts with studies from Japan, which report MSA-C as more common than MSA-P [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>The predominant motor feature can change over time with disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, the designation of MSA-P or MSA-C refers to the predominant motor problem at the time the patient is evaluated. As an example, in a European study of 437 patients from 19 centers, the proportion of patients classified as MSA-P and MSA-C was 68 and 32 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, among the entire cohort, parkinsonism and cerebellar ataxia were present in 87 and 64 percent, respectively.</p><p>Parkinsonism in MSA-P is characterized by <span class=\"nowrap\">akinesia/bradykinesia,</span> rigidity, postural instability, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an irregular jerky postural and action tremor. Up to two-thirds of patients with MSA have this tremor involving the arms. Although much less common than in idiopathic Parkinson disease, rest tremor occurs in as many as one-third of patients with MSA-P [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other warning signs that herald parkinsonism in MSA include postural instability and falls (usually within three years of motor onset), pyramidal signs, including extensor plantar responses, and rapid progression regardless of dopaminergic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,29</a>].</p><p>Additional movement disorders associated with MSA-P may include stimulus-sensitive cortical myoclonus, hemiballism and chorea, and dystonia unrelated to dopaminergic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Specific types of dystonia include orofacial dystonia or dyskinesia, occasionally resembling &quot;risus sardonicus&quot; (spasm of the facial muscles producing a distorted grinning expression), and Pisa syndrome (subacute axial dystonia with severe lateral flexion of the trunk, head, and neck).</p><p>Camptocormia (severe anterior flexion of the spine) and disproportionate anterocollis are common abnormalities of posture in MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,33</a>]. The anterocollis, in particular, is characteristic of MSA although it can occur in other forms of degenerative parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>The cause of camptocormia and anterocollis in MSA is heterogeneous. While some authors believe that they represent forms of axial dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], there are other data to suggest that myopathy is the cause, at least in certain cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Electromyography usually clarifies the picture, although biopsy may be necessary when the diagnosis is uncertain. However, it is not entirely clear what a biopsy of normal neck muscle should look like in patients with parkinsonism. &#160;</p><p>In contrast to MSA-P, the motor features of MSA-C involve predominant cerebellar dysfunction that manifests as gait ataxia, limb ataxia, ataxic dysarthria, and cerebellar disturbances of eye movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ocular abnormalities may include gaze-evoked nystagmus, impaired smooth pursuits with saccadic intrusion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ocular dysmetria.</p><p>Dysphagia is a prominent symptom of both types of MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The speech pattern of patients with MSA is also characteristic. In addition to the hypophonic monotony often seen in idiopathic Parkinson disease, patients with MSA-P also have an increase in pitch and a quivering, strained element to their speech [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, patients with MSA-C have a more typical cerebellar scanning dysarthria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysautonomia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysautonomia is a feature of both parkinsonian and cerebellar MSA presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among patients in a large European MSA registry, symptomatic dysautonomia was present in almost all, with high rates of urinary dysfunction (83 percent) and symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Nearly all men with MSA develop early erectile dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other common early symptoms include increased urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence, or incomplete bladder emptying. Although these features are also seen in idiopathic Parkinson disease, they generally begin earlier and are more profound in MSA. As an example, a study comparing 52 patients with MSA and matched patients with Parkinson disease noted that urinary dysfunction appeared in less than two years with MSA but after five years with Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Detrusor underactivity with dysuria was observed within four years in 58 percent of patients with MSA and thereafter in 76 percent. In contrast, the frequency of constipation in MSA is similar to that seen in idiopathic Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In the natural history of MSA, orthostatic hypotension usually emerges after urogenital symptoms appear. In a series of 100 patients with MSA, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was present in 68 percent, and was severe in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The clinical diagnosis of probable MSA requires the presence of an orthostatic decrease of blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep and breathing disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep and breathing abnormalities are common in MSA. At least two-thirds of patients have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The content of the dreams can be vivid, violent, and frightening. The usual muscle atony in REM sleep is lost, and patients may act out their dreams. For example, patients may talk or shout during sleep and may strike out at their bed partner. This feature of MSA often precedes the motor manifestations, sometimes by decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. It tends to improve as the disease progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Nocturnal or diurnal laryngeal stridor occurs in approximately one-third of patients with MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is a risk factor for sudden death in MSA. The sound of stridor is high pitched and occurs with inspiration. Patients may also experience sleep apnea and involuntary sighs or gasps during the day. Snoring may increase from premorbid level or may be new-onset. These abnormalities of breathing are uncommon in idiopathic Parkinson disease and in other atypical parkinsonian syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, REM sleep behavior disorder and obstructive sleep apnea are not specific to MSA. REM sleep behavior disorder is frequently present in idiopathic Parkinson disease and some forms of spinocerebellar ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Both excessive daytime sleepiness and restless leg syndrome are present in nearly 30 percent of patients with MSA experience, rates that are similar to or greater than those seen in Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29758549\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive function in MSA tends to be relatively well preserved compared with idiopathic Parkinson disease and other atypical parkinsonian syndromes, possibly reflecting a lesser degree of cortical involvement in MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and the younger age of onset. Nevertheless, although cognitive impairment in MSA is uncommon, it does occur and its presence does not exclude MSA as a clinical diagnosis in patients who have classic symptoms and signs of the disorder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter European study evaluated a prospective cohort of 372 patients with a clinical diagnosis of MSA and found cognitive impairment in approximately 20 percent, predominantly involving diminished verbal fluency, perseveration and executive dysfunction, as seen in Parkinson disease and progressive supranuclear palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. One limitation of this report is that few patients had pathologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis, and among those who did, the clinical diagnosis of MSA was proved wrong in 35 percent of those with cognitive impairment compared with 5 percent of those without cognitive impairment. Thus, this study probably overestimated the rate of cognitive impairment in MSA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small case-control study found that patients with MSA-P had cognitive impairments involving visuospatial and constructional function, verbal fluency, and executive function, while those with MSA-C had impairments only in visuospatial and constructional function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MSA can develop emotional incontinence (also called pseudobulbar affect), characterized by crying inappropriately without sadness or laughing inappropriately without mirth. This manifestation is also seen, perhaps more commonly, in progressive supranuclear palsy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29758569\"><span class=\"h2\">Other features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MSA may have an associated Raynaud phenomenon (an exaggerated vascular response to cold temperature or emotional stress) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cold, dusky extremities that blanch on pressure with poor circulatory return. These symptoms may be provoked by ergot drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MSA appears to be associated with high rates of anxiety and depression. In one study of 286 patients with MSA, probable depression and probable anxiety were present in 43 and 37 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Olfactory dysfunction is generally mild in MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]; a small case-control study found that olfactory dysfunction in MSA is less severe than that seen in Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain MRI in patients with MSA-P and MSA-C may reveal atrophy of the putamen, pons, and middle cerebellar peduncles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,53,54</a>]. On T2 MRI sequences, signal changes include hypointensity of the posterior putamen (also described as a slit-like void), a hyperintense lateral putaminal rim, and hyperintensities of the middle cerebellar peduncles. These changes are supportive of the diagnosis of MSA rather than idiopathic Parkinson disease. However, they are not present in all patients with MSA. Furthermore, they are not specific for differentiating MSA from other atypical parkinsonian syndromes.</p><p>The &quot;hot cross bun sign&quot; refers to hyperintense T2 signal in the shape of a cross within the pons that arises from degeneration of transverse pontocerebellar fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,53,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,53,55</a>]. However, this is also a nonspecific finding that has also been described in patients with other causes of parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>].</p><p>Diffusion weighted MRI in patients with MSA shows increased diffusivity (high apparent diffusion coefficient values) in the putamen, a finding that is sometimes observed in progressive supranuclear palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Preliminary data suggest that this technique can be used to monitor disease progression in MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Positron emission tomography using (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose in patients with MSA may reveal regional glucose hypometabolism in the striatum, brainstem, and cerebellum, but the true sensitivity and specificity of these findings for differentiating MSA from Parkinson disease is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Striatal dopamine transporter imaging using SPECT (eg, 123I-FP-CIT SPECT scan or DaTscan) can reliably distinguish patients with Parkinson disease and other parkinsonian syndromes from controls or patients with essential tremor, but it cannot differentiate Parkinson disease and the parkinsonian syndromes from one another. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'DaTscan'</a>.)</p><p>I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging of the heart demonstrates postganglionic abnormalities in patients with Parkinson disease but not those with MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. This cardiac imaging technique shows promise for differentiating the two diseases, but its clinical utility has yet to be established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of MSA is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. One postulated mechanism involves prion-like spreading of aberrant alpha-synuclein from neurons to glia through functionally connected networks, thereby leading to glial and myelin dysfunction and an inflammatory cascade that promotes secondary neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>The presence of glial inclusions and myelin disruption in the central nervous system suggest that MSA is a primary disorder of the glia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,63</a>]. The glial (oligodendroglial) cytoplasmic inclusions that are characteristic of MSA contain hyperphosphorylated alpha-synuclein, tau, ubiquitin, leucine-rich repeat <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine-protein</span> kinase 2, and many other proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-68</a>]. Alpha-synuclein immunostaining is a sensitive marker of inclusion pathology in MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,69</a>]. Neuronal inclusions of various types also are present in the majority of patients with MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p>Myelin degeneration is characteristic of MSA. A small case-control study found a significantly greater degree of white matter hyperintensities on MRI scans from patients with MSA compared with scans from patients with Parkinson disease and healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. This finding could be related to the loss of myelin or to cerebral hypoperfusion from orthostatic blood pressure fluctuations in MSA.</p><p>The pathologic distribution of glial cytoplasmic inclusions, along with the degree of neuronal loss within specific regions of the neuraxis, primarily determines the clinical presentation of MSA. In addition, neuronal cell loss appears to be significantly correlated with the pathologic burden of glial cytoplasmic inclusions and disease duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Typical sites of pathologic involvement include the putamen, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, pontine nuclei, inferior olivary nucleus, Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and intermediolateral cell columns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Autonomic dysfunction is secondary to loss of cells in the intermediolateral cell columns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>] and loss of catecholaminergic neurons of the C1 area of the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. This is manifested by severe variability in blood pressure and heart rate, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and postprandial hypotension. Arginine-vasopressin release from magnocellular hypothalamic neurons is impaired; this may be mediated by loss of A1 neurons in the caudal VLM.</p><p>In idiopathic Parkinson disease, positron emission tomography imaging studies have indicated that dysautonomia is caused by peripheral nervous system dysfunction, particularly myocardial sympathetic denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In contrast, the peripheral autonomic system appears to be spared in MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Some persistence of autonomic tone may be responsible for the frequently observed supine hypertension in MSA.</p><p>Bladder abnormalities in MSA include urinary incontinence and retention. Mechanisms leading to these include detrusor hyperreflexia from loss of inhibitory input to the pontine micturition center, loss of corticotropin-releasing factor neurons in the pontine micturition area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], and bladder atonia primarily from severe damage to Onuf's nucleus in the sacral spinal cord; the latter is likely also the cause of erectile dysfunction in men. Bowel dysmotility is frequently seen in patients with MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], as is thermoregulatory dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Motor abnormalities seen in MSA-P are due primarily to neuronal loss and gliosis in the substantia nigra, putamen, caudate, and globus pallidus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One of the features that distinguish MSA and other atypical parkinsonian syndromes (ie, Parkinson-plus syndromes) from idiopathic Parkinson disease is the lack of dramatic and sustained response to levodopa. The extent of putaminal involvement may determine the poor response to levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Levodopa responsiveness'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to MSA-P, the cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs that characterize the MSA-C subtype are secondary to degeneration of the cerebellar Purkinje cells, middle cerebellar peduncles, inferior olivary nuclei, basis pontis, and pontine nuclei. However, a majority of patients with MSA-P probably have subclinical loss of nigral neurons based upon findings from 123I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Loss of cholinergic mesopontine neurons, combined with loss of locus ceruleus neurons and preservation of rostral raphe neurons, may contribute to REM sleep abnormalities often seen in MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Respiratory abnormalities may reflect loss of cholinergic neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the ventral medulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Respiratory stridor, abnormal nocturnal ventilation, and pseudobulbar features are possibly secondary to brainstem pathology, and may involve the nucleus ambiguus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323994\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role genetics in the pathogenesis of MSA is undefined. One report found that mutations in the COQ2 gene were associated with familial MSA in two Japanese families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In other studies, MSA was associated with copy number loss of the SHC2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>] and with genetic variants of the SNCA gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. A subsequent genome-wide association study from Europe and North America that compared 918 patients with MSA and 3864 controls found no significant loci, and in particular did not find an association of MSA with genetic variation in COQ2 and SNCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of MSA is based upon the clinical features. No laboratory or imaging studies are diagnostic, particularly since findings are often normal or equivocal in early disease.</p><p>Levodopa responsiveness should be tested to help distinguish MSA from idiopathic Parkinson disease, although making a distinction can be complicated. For a diagnostic trial of levodopa to be valid in this setting, it is essential that the daily dose be high enough (900 to 1000 mg) in order to avoid a false negative result. Furthermore, some patients who later in the clinical course of progressive parkinsonism meet diagnostic criteria for MSA will show an early positive response to levodopa, thereby producing a falsely positive diagnosis of Parkinson disease, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Levodopa responsiveness'</a> below.)</p><p>Neuroimaging can be helpful in excluding other conditions and may show signs such as putaminal atrophy, slit-like signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin, and hypointensity of the putamen relative to the globus pallidus. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Urethral or anal sphincter electromyography can support the diagnosis of MSA if the results show chronic reinnervation with markedly prolonged motor units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/80,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,87,88</a>].

While open-label and retrospective studies suggest transient benefit from levodopa in 30 to 50 percent of patients with MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,20,73,90-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,73,90-95</a>], levodopa does not provide long-term benefit in MSA, and the loss of responsiveness can occur abruptly. However, treatment must be individualized since some patients will function better on levodopa than without it.</p><p/><p>Levodopa responsiveness is tested by administering levodopa combined with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (eg, levodopa-carbidopa) in escalating doses up to 1000 mg of levodopa daily as necessary and tolerated over a three-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A positive response requires a clinically significant improvement in motor symptoms, defined objectively as a 30 percent or more improvement in the motor component of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>As in idiopathic Parkinson disease, levodopa treatment may trigger or exacerbate orthostatic hypotension in patients with MSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Levodopa use also can result in motor fluctuations and dyskinesia.

Levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with MSA are largely restricted to the neck or face, and often consist of sustained dystonic spasms.
