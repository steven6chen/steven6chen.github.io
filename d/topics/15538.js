The immature brain, particularly in the neonate and young infant, differs from the adult brain in the basic mechanisms of epileptogenesis and propagation of seizures. It is more prone to seizures, but seizures are more apt to disappear as the child grows.</p><p>This topic presents an overview of the treatment of seizures and epileptic syndromes in children. Treatment of neonatal seizures and the treatment of specific epilepsy syndromes are presented separately.

A decision must be made about initiating chronic antiseizure drug treatment if a potentially reversible acute cause is not found during the evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of seizures in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of seizures in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Setting in which episodes occur'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539283048\"><span class=\"h2\">First-time unprovoked seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision whether to treat a child with an antiseizure drug after an initial unprovoked seizure should be individualized, weighing the risks of recurrent seizure against the potential risks and benefits of antiseizure drug therapy and incorporating patient values and preferences.</p><p>The term &quot;unprovoked seizure&quot; refers to a seizure of unknown etiology as well as one that occurs in relation to a preexisting brain lesion or progressive nervous system disorder (often referred to as a remote symptomatic seizure). Unprovoked seizures are distinct from seizures due to an acute condition such as a toxic or metabolic disturbance, fever, head trauma, or acute stroke (ie, acute symptomatic seizures). (See <a href=\"#H1539283287\" class=\"local\">'Acute symptomatic seizure'</a> below.)</p><p>The main factors to consider in making a decision of whether or not to treat a child with a first-time unprovoked seizure include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk for recurrent seizures, which varies based on clinical factors. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk of seizure recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative risk reduction that can be expected from immediate antiseizure drug therapy. Limited data in children suggest that early versus delayed antiseizure drug therapy reduces the short-term risk of a recurrent seizure but does not appear to affect the long-term prognosis of epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H1539283591\" class=\"local\">'Effects of early versus deferred therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks of not treating, which include another seizure with its attendant risk of injury and psychologic stigma (including restrictions on driving and work environment in teenagers and young adults) and, infrequently, status epilepticus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks of chronic antiseizure drugs, which include possible effects on school performance and behavior, allergic reactions, and systemic toxicity. The financial burden of chronic antiseizure drugs, office visits, and laboratory tests should also be considered.</p><p/><p>A practice parameter for the treatment of a child with a first unprovoked seizure published by the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society provides the following recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with antiseizure drugs is not indicated for the prevention of the development of epilepsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with antiseizure drugs may be considered when the benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure are greater than the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial side effects.</p><p/><p>This is consistent with the current practice of most neurologists to refrain from treating a child with a first unprovoked seizure. A consensus statement from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) similarly states that in an otherwise well infant, a policy of &quot;wait and see&quot; with close follow-up monitoring is reasonable after a first afebrile seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Even if the child has a static encephalopathy, treatment can be withheld until a recurrence pattern is established. The risk of seizure recurrence is higher in children with a potential remote symptomatic etiology, particularly if the seizure was focal and the electroencephalogram (EEG) or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is abnormal; in such cases, the benefits of immediate antiseizure drug therapy may outweigh the risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of seizure recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child who is neurologically normal, has no history of a prior neurologic illness, and has an unprovoked seizure with no evident acute cause has an approximately 25 percent risk of having another seizure in the next year and a 45 percent risk over the next three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>Clinical factors associated with an increased risk of recurrent seizures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior neurologic insult (ie, remote symptomatic seizure)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant brain MRI findings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal EEG</p><p/><p>The magnitude of risk associated with each one of these factors varies, and the additive effects of multiple risk factors have not been clearly established. Several studies illustrate the risk spectrum:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large prospective study of 283 children with a first-time unprovoked seizure, neurologically normal children with no history of prior neurologic illness had a 24 percent risk of having a seizure in the next year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The one-year recurrence risk increased to 37 percent in children with a prior neurologic insult (remote symptomatic), such as cerebral palsy, and increased to 70 percent in patients who had two seizures separated by at least 24 hours. Most but not all of the children in this study were not treated with an antiseizure drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the same study, the one-year recurrence risk was 41 percent if the EEG was abnormal (epileptiform activity, focal or generalized slowing) compared with 15 percent in children with a normal EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, significant MRI findings, present in 16 percent of children, were associated with a twofold higher incidence of recurrent seizure by 27 months (80 versus 44 percent) and were more predictive of short-term seizure recurrence than EEG findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Status epilepticus as the presenting seizure may be another risk factor for recurrent seizures, although the available data are less consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539283591\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects of early versus deferred therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, immediate antiseizure drug therapy after a first-time unprovoked seizure reduces the risk of recurrence by approximately 35 percent at one to two years postseizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; more limited data in children suggest that the short-term benefits of antiseizure drug therapy are similar to those in adults.</p><p>Withholding treatment until after the second seizure does not alter the long-term prognosis of epilepsy, however, as demonstrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study that randomly assigned 419 patients with a first tonic-clonic seizure to immediate antiseizure drug therapy or treatment only after a second seizure found that immediate treatment reduced the short-term relapse rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, at one and two years, the number of patients who remained seizure free in the early-treatment and delayed-treatment groups were similar (83 to 87 percent at one year, 60 to 68 percent at two years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar study of 1443 patients (38 percent were &le;19 years old) found that immediate antiseizure drug treatment reduced the short-term (one- to two-year) risk of seizure relapse, but had no effect on the long-term risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The benefit of immediate treatment was lost by four years after a first seizure and by six years after multiple seizures.</p><p/><p>The long-term risk of mortality after a single seizure appears to be quite low, and there is no evidence that treatment after an initial seizure has any impact on mortality. In a cohort study of 407 children with a first unprovoked seizure, four had a seizure-related death over a 14-year observation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Each of these had multiple seizures that were not fully controlled with antiseizure drug treatment; none died prior to initiation of antiseizure drug therapy, and two had been treated after the first seizure that was status epilepticus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539283280\"><span class=\"h2\">Second unprovoked seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children who present with a second unprovoked seizure are started on antiseizure drug therapy, since seizure recurrence indicates that the patient has a substantially increased risk for additional seizures (ie, epilepsy).</p><p>There are some exceptions, however. Many parents elect no antiseizure drugs if the seizures are infrequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild. The definitions of &quot;infrequent&quot; and &quot;mild&quot; may vary from parent to parent. By contrast, children with absence seizures, atonic seizures or drop attacks, and infantile spasms are virtually always treated, since they usually present to the clinician with an already established pattern of frequent seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539283287\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute symptomatic seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have a seizure in the setting of an acute illness (eg, acute infection, acute head injury) have a low risk of seizure recurrence compared with other children with a first seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When a seizure is associated with a specific underlying acute etiology, seizure recurrence is likely only if the underlying etiology recurs. Examples include seizures associated with febrile illnesses, metabolic derangements such as hyponatremia, and concussion. Management of these seizures should be focused on correction of the acute provoking illness or anomaly and preventing its recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539294071\"><span class=\"h2\">Febrile seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children presenting with a first-time febrile seizure have an approximately 30 to 35 percent chance of having another febrile seizure during early childhood. Although antiseizure drugs have been shown to lower the risk of recurrent febrile seizures, given the benign nature of febrile seizures, the risks of side effects from antiseizure drugs generally outweigh the benefits for most patients. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures#H762181856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of febrile seizures&quot;, section on 'Role of preventive therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539283294\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal seizures may be the first, and sometimes the only, clinical sign of a central nervous system disorder in the newborn infant. Seizures may indicate the presence of a potential treatable etiology and should prompt an immediate evaluation to determine the cause and institute etiologic-specific therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures#H530063767\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures&quot;, section on 'Etiologic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The decision whether or not to institute antiseizure drug therapy depends on multiple factors, including seizure duration and severity as well as seizure etiology.

Monotherapy is associated with better compliance, fewer adverse effects, less potential for teratogenicity, and lower cost than is polytherapy. Drug interactions are avoided and pharmacokinetics are simplified.</p><p>There is an ever-growing list of antiseizure drugs and nonpharmacologic therapies available to manage childhood epilepsy. Traditionally, the medications have been separated into &quot;older&quot; and &quot;newer&quot; groups based upon their historic regulatory approval and availability. Typically, when a medication is first approved for epilepsy, it receives an &quot;on-label indication&quot; for add-on (adjunctive) therapy for partial-onset seizures in adults. Then, as experience grows and other studies are done, the use of the drug may expand to other seizure types and younger age groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539283924\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizure-related considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antiseizure drug chosen for initial therapy should be one that is highly effective for a particular seizure type or syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The initial work-up should include an attempt to determine the specific type of seizure the child experienced and, if possible, the epilepsy syndrome. The optimal choice of antiseizure drug depends on the type of seizure and the epilepsy syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Classification, etiology, and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For some epilepsy syndromes, available data support choosing certain antiseizure drugs over others as first-line therapy.

These antiseizure drugs allow for &quot;make-up dosing.&quot; As an example, if a child on ethosuximide misses the once-a-day dose, it can be taken the next day with the regularly scheduled dose.</p><p>Elimination kinetics also should be considered when choosing an antiseizure drug. With linear or first-order kinetics, a constant fractional amount of the drug is eliminated over time, independent of the concentration of the drug in the serum. With nonlinear, dose-dependent, saturable, or concentration-dependent kinetics, as the level of the drug increases, clearance declines as the elimination mechanisms become saturated. Linear kinetics is more desirable.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Valproate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> have nonlinear kinetics. Phenytoin is particularly troublesome, with linear kinetics at low serum levels, and nonlinear kinetics as the serum level approaches the low- to mid-therapeutic range. Thus, a small increase in dose may lead to a large and potentially toxic increase in the serum level. At high serum levels, phenytoin's half-life is significantly longer. At these higher levels, it may take only a minimal increase in the daily dose to attain the target level; in some cases, this increase is made every other day.</p><p>In infants and younger children, oral suspensions, chewable tablets, and sprinkle formulations may be useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539294684\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adverse effects of antiseizure drugs make a significant contribution to reduced quality of life in patients with epilepsy. While many antiseizure drug side effects (eg, drowsiness, dizziness, diplopia, and imbalance) seem to be common to this entire class of medicines, others are more specific to an individual drug. These should be considered in selecting an antiseizure drug, since certain side effects are either more likely or more problematic in certain patients.</p><p>Common neurotoxic and systemic side effects are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755 \">table 3</a>).

Most antiseizure drugs should be started at approximately 10 to 25 percent of the planned maintenance dose. Antiseizure drugs with a long half-life can be started at close to the maintenance dose.</p><p>In general, the dose should be increased at intervals not exceeding five half-lives to allow the serum level to plateau between each dose increment. If seizures are frequent, the titration may be accelerated to achieve a therapeutic benefit, but this may come at the cost of increased side effects.</p><p>The antiseizure drug dose should be increased until seizures stop, unremitting adverse effects occur, or serum levels reach a high or supratherapeutic range without a significant impact upon seizure frequency. The recommended upper therapeutic serum levels of most of the antiseizure drugs can be exceeded if side effects are absent. This should be done with particular caution with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> because of its nonlinear pharmacokinetics and with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> because of dose-related thrombocytopenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68462%7EPEDS%2F80434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68462 graphicRef80434 \">table 2A-B</a>).</p><p>If side effects appear with upward titration but are tolerable, the dose should remain stable for several weeks to determine if the symptoms remit. Dose increases can continue at a slower rate if side effects remit and seizures continue.</p><p>Some patients may require greater-than-standard doses of an antiseizure drug to reach therapeutic levels. Low levels at high doses often are caused by poor compliance but also may be secondary to hypermetabolism of the antiseizure drug (ie, higher-than-normal clearance because of increased hepatic metabolism). If levels are not increasing as anticipated and noncompliance is unlikely, the child should be given a loading dose under medical observation and levels should be measured over the next 12 to 24 hours. A genetically regulated hypermetabolism probably exists if levels remain low, and higher daily doses are indicated.</p><p>Occasionally, children manifest slow drug clearance, often caused by inherited variations in the degradation enzymes. These individuals require lower maintenance doses.</p><p>Ideally, daily antiseizure drug doses should be given at intervals shorter than the half-life in order to avoid wide excursions in serum levels. The longer the half-life, the less frequent the dosing. Compliance is improved when medications are taken on schedule and prompted by an association with a routine daily activity, such as mealtime or brushing teeth. A variation of an hour or so in scheduled dosing is usually not significant. Children should not be awakened at night to take antiseizure drugs.</p><p>As a child grows, the antiseizure drug dose may need to be increased to keep up with his or her body mass. However, the clearance of some antiseizure drugs decreases and approaches adult rates in adolescence. Serum levels may remain stable as the declining per kilogram dose is balanced by the declining clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H614910065\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional considerations in adolescent girls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of issues are important to consider in preadolescent and adolescent girls when initiating antiseizure drug therapy. As discussed above, the potential teratogenicity of various antiseizure drugs should be discussed and weighed when choosing a specific antiseizure drug in girls, since in many cases initial therapy will be continued long term, into the childbearing years. (See <a href=\"#H614910041\" class=\"local\">'Teratogenicity'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks associated with epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Effect of antiseizure drugs on the fetus'</a>.)</p><p>The importance of an effective method of contraception should also be reviewed with girls who are sexually active or may become sexually active while taking antiseizure drugs. Certain antiseizure drugs have the potential to lower the efficacy of hormonal contraception through hepatic enzyme induction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60182 \">table 6</a>). Conversely, hormonal contraception can lower serum levels of some antiseizure drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that individuals taking enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs or lamotrigine use a method of contraception other than hormonal pill, patch, or ring contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods are an effective alternative in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539284498\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP AND MONITORING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7894663\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum drug levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum antiseizure drug levels are available and informative for certain antiseizure drugs but not others. The availability of a serum drug level testing for an antiseizure drug does not always mean that levels are useful clinically. As an example, serum drug levels for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levetiracetam</a> can be ordered but have not been shown to correlate with clinical efficacy or tolerability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Antiseizure drugs for which serum drug levels can be useful are noted in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68462%7EPEDS%2F80434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68462 graphicRef80434 \">table 2A-B</a>).</p><p>Even for these antiseizure drugs, serum levels should not be used in isolation to guide to therapy. The therapeutic range is different for each patient. Many patients will achieve seizure control at levels below the recommended range; others require higher levels. There is no reason to increase the dose if seizures stop when the serum level is &quot;low&quot; or &quot;subtherapeutic.&quot; If the level reaches the &quot;therapeutic range,&quot; yet seizures continue, the level should be increased as long as there are no adverse effects.</p><p>It is helpful to have a baseline antiseizure drug level once seizure control has been attained, which can be compared with levels obtained when seizures recur to ascertain whether the breakthrough is caused by low serum levels from poor compliance, interaction with another medication, decreased absorption (eg, during a diarrheal illness or gastritis with vomiting), or change in medication preparation (eg, brand name to generic drug formulation). If a child is placed on another long-term medication, measuring the antiseizure drug level after the dose of the new drug has been stabilized may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539285555\"><span class=\"h2\">Other laboratory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although routine laboratory screening of hematologic and hepatic function is commonly done in children receiving antiseizure drugs, evidence is convincing that this routine laboratory testing is not cost effective or necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>With the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felbamate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">felbamate</a>, which is associated with a relatively high risk of aplastic anemia and requires close laboratory monitoring, the risk of serious side effects with most of the antiseizure drugs is extremely small and, in most instances, appears in the first few months after the antiseizure drug is initiated. Many idiosyncratic reactions related to antiseizure drugs, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, serum sickness reactions, and pancreatitis, are not predicted by presymptomatic blood test abnormalities (with the exception of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions related to certain human leucocyte antigen [HLA] types). (See <a href=\"#H1539284487\" class=\"local\">'Role of pretreatment HLA testing'</a> above.)</p><p>Once a child has been on a stable antiseizure drug regimen for several months, there is little indication for routine monitoring of laboratory studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68462%7EPEDS%2F80434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68462 graphicRef80434 \">table 2A-B</a>). The clinician should be clinically vigilant and have a high index of suspicion for adverse events in any child receiving chronic antiseizure drugs. A seemingly benign illness that lasts for more than a few days should prompt a complete blood count (CBC) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver function studies. Vomiting (the most common early symptom of hepatotoxicity or pancreatitis), prolonged unexplained fever, easy bruising, extreme fatigue or lethargy, flu-like symptoms, unexplained worsening of seizures, change in mental status, and abdominal pain should lead to further investigations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A family history can be helpful in making decisions about laboratory testing. Adverse reactions to medications, particularly those that are hematologic or cutaneous, or a strong family history of autoimmune disorders, should heighten the concern for idiosyncratic reactions and hematologic complications.

The clinician should be clinically vigilant and have a low index of suspicion for adverse events in any child receiving chronic antiseizure drugs. A seemingly benign illness that lasts for more than a few days should prompt a CBC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver function studies. Vomiting (the most common early symptom of hepatotoxicity or pancreatitis), prolonged unexplained fever, easy bruising, extreme fatigue or lethargy, flu-like symptoms, unexplained worsening of seizures, change in mental status, and abdominal pain should lead to further investigations. (See <a href=\"#H1539285555\" class=\"local\">'Other laboratory monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased suicidality has been linked to several antiseizure drugs. Patients taking antiseizure drugs should be monitored for emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation or depression.

Medical treatment failure is often apparent early in the course of treatment. In these cases, referral to a comprehensive epilepsy center is appropriate to explore additional therapeutic options, including epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, and the ketogenic diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Refractory seizures and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal of antiseizure drug therapy should be considered in most children after two years without seizures, regardless of the etiology of the seizures. The likelihood of recurrence after a two-year period without seizures is approximately 30 to 40 percent. Antiseizure drugs should be tapered rather than halted abruptly.
