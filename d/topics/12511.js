Plasma drug levels can vary more than 1000-fold when the same drug dose is administered to two individuals having approximately the same weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Drug-drug interactions, drug-food interactions, sex, age, disease state (ie, renal and hepatic function) and pregnancy can all influence variability in drug responses between patients. However, genetic factors are also likely to play a major role, since the individual response to a given pharmacologic agent is highly reproducible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>In theory, the identification of genetic factors that influence drug absorption, metabolism, and action at the receptor level should allow for individualized therapy; this could optimize drug efficacy and minimize toxicity profiles in a given population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/1,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-8</a>]. The potential for cost savings (through increased drug efficacy) and for decreased morbidity and mortality (through increased drug safety and fewer adverse drug reactions [ADRs]) is immense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Although many ADRs are preventable and attributed in many cases to human error, others appear idiosyncratic, and potentially influenced by genetic factors. In one study of 2227 ADRs identified in a large teaching hospital, fewer than 50 percent had readily identified causes, and thus, might have been due to pharmacogenetic variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>This topic provides a practical overview of the field of pharmacogenomics, including the historical context, the different ways in which pharmacogenomic differences can affect the response to drug therapy, an overview of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved labeling of medications for which genetic testing is recommended, and the challenges that must be overcome before routine pharmacogenetic testing (genotyping) is fully integrated into mainstream clinical medicine. Throughout, examples of relevant pharmacogenetic associations will be cited.</p><p>While the details of all known specific drug-gene interactions are beyond the scope of this overview, current information regarding most of the known associations can be obtained through the National Institute of Health (NIH) Pharmacogenetics Research Network's PharmGKB: The Pharmacogenetics and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3772796410\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following terminology is used to describe factors that contribute to the effect of a specific drug on a specific individual:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacogenomics</strong> &ndash; Pharmacogenomics refers to the role of various components of the genome on response to a drug. Among the most commonly studied are genetic sequence variants, structural changes in chromosomes (eg, translocations), epigenetic variants (eg, changes in gene methylation), and variation in the expression profile of genes (changes in messenger RNA [mRNA] levels) or non-coding RNA (eg, changes in microRNA). The genetic variation can be inherited through the germline or acquired (eg, in a tumor). The availability of high-throughput techniques to interrogate the entire genome has facilitated many pharmacogenomic studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacogenetics</strong> &ndash; Pharmacogenetics is a subcategory of pharmacogenomics that refers to the role of genetic variation on response to a drug. The genetic variation can be inherited through the germline or acquired (eg, in a tumor). This term generally is used to refer to a specific DNA polymorphism or coding variant rather than global changes across the genome. In practice, pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are often used interchangeably.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacokinetics</strong> &ndash; Pharmacokinetics (PK) refers to how a drug moves through an individual's body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A drug's PK includes its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, all of which affect the drug's effect by altering the drug's concentration at its site of action. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacodynamics</strong> &ndash; Pharmacodynamics (PD) refers to an individual's body's therapeutic response to a drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This generally is determined by the drug's affinity and activity at its site of action, which is often a receptor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genotyping</strong> &ndash; Genotyping refers to determining the combination of alleles (variants) at a specific location in the genome. The alleles can be single base changes, insertions, deletions, or tandem repeats. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic variation</strong> &ndash; Genetic variation refers to differences in genetic sequences among individuals in a population. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) refer to variation at a single base pair, typically with a population frequency of at least 1 percent. Other forms of variation include insertions, deletions, copy number variants, and short tandem repeats. Variants that are seen at much lower prevalence than 1 percent of the population are often referred to as mutations, although this term may also be used to distinguish between variation that is inherited versus variation that arises de novo (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;</a>). All forms of variation have the potential to impact phenotype, regardless of their frequency, but the impact depends on a number of factors including the location of the variation within the genome and the functional consequences of the variation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epigenetic changes</strong> &ndash; Epigenetic changes are those that affect genes without altering the gene sequence. This may occur via changes in gene methylation or histone modification (methylation, acetylation), either of which can influence the rate of transcription or silencing of gene expression. Other epigenetic changes include the alterations in noncoding RNAs and telomere length. An example of an epigenetic change that affects drug metabolism is reduced sensitivity of a tumor to a chemotherapeutic drug due to gene methylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL CONTEXT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The roots of pharmacogenomics may date back as early as the 6th century BC, when Pythagoras was said to have recognized that eating fava beans caused illness in some, but not all, individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In the 1940s, the immunochemist William Boyd noted that in contrast to Mediterranean populations, native Britons almost never developed hemolytic anemia after ingestion of fava beans; he suggested a genetic difference as the probable explanation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is now known that the hemolytic anemia associated with ingestion of fava beans, which may also occur with a variety of pharmacologic agents, is due to X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency&quot;, section on 'Inciting drugs, foods, illnesses'</a>.)</p><p>The following pioneering discoveries ushered in the modern field of pharmacogenetics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the early 1900s, Garrod recognized a subset of psychiatric patients who developed porphyria upon administration of sulphonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1932, Snyder attributed the 'phenylthiourea non-taster' phenotype to an autosomal recessive trait whose inheritance varied according to ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 1950s, patients with an inherited deficiency of plasma cholinesterase were noted to have a prolonged paralytic response to suxamethonium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1957, Motulsky first suggested that interindividual differences in drug efficacy as well as ADRs were at least partially attributable to genetic differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The term &quot;pharmacogenetics&quot; was first coined by Frederich Vogel, a German geneticist, in 1959 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of genetics in the interindividual variation in drug response was reinforced by a series of twin studies conducted in the early 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. Plasma half-lives of many drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, were found to be similar in monozygotic twins, but varied significantly among dizygotic twins, siblings, and the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the late 1970s, two independent groups associated a deficiency in drug metabolism that was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern with a markedly higher frequency of side effects in certain volunteers taking the antihypertensive debrisoquine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and the antiarrhythmic sparteine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Approximately ten years later, the metabolism of both drugs was shown to result from allelic variation at the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This was the first example of applied genotyping in the field of pharmacogenetics.</p><p/><p>Since then, advances in human genetic technology and an increased understanding of the molecular basis of drug metabolism, transport, and action at the level of its target (often a receptor) has led to the characterization of dozens of mutations and functional pharmacogenetic polymorphisms that influence the response to drug therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WAYS IN WHICH GENETIC FACTORS INFLUENCE DRUG RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heritability of some drug responses was formally established via genetic studies, including the twin studies of Vessel and Page described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>].</p><p>However, most drugs have not been formally studied to assess the potential for response variability based upon hereditary characteristics, primarily because it is neither safe nor ethical to administer most medications to individuals in whom they are not indicated. Barring formal genetic studies, the distribution of responses to a certain drug in populations can strongly suggest a genetic component.</p><p>The interindividual response distribution to a drug may be either multimodal or unimodal. A multimodal distribution suggests distinct population subgroups of responders, and therefore plausibility of a pharmacogenetic basis for response heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A unimodal drug response distribution also supports the possibility of pharmacogenetic variation in response, with subjects demonstrating either a &quot;good&quot; or a &quot;poor&quot; response.</p><p>In particular, the combination of significant interindividual variability in level <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> response to a drug plus high repeatability within individual patients (the likelihood of a subsequent <span class=\"nowrap\">beneficial/poor</span> response to a drug given a prior response) strongly suggests the potential for pharmacogenetic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Pharmacogenomic influences on drug response have traditionally been divided into four categories based upon the impact of genetic variability on the pharmacologic properties of a drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effect on drug pharmacokinetics; an example is a genetic variant that alters drug metabolism, affecting plasma concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effects on pharmacodynamics; an example is a genetic variation that reduces binding of the drug to its receptor, thereby decreasing therapeutic efficacy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effects on idiosyncratic reactions, such as the likelihood of a hypersensitivity reaction to a certain drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effects on disease pathogenesis or severity and response to specific therapies; these include specific molecular defects related to the pathogenesis of certain malignancies for which specific targeted therapies have been developed.</p><p/><p>Specific examples of medications and specific genetic variants relevant to each of these pharmacogenetic categories are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65875 \">table 1</a>). The following sections will expand upon these four categories, and provide clinically relevant examples illustrating how pharmacogenetic variability might potentially influence drug response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacokinetics refers to the transport and metabolism of administered drugs, including absorption, distribution, tissue localization, biotransformation, and excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The vast majority of pharmacogenetic investigations reported in the literature have been in this area, with the major areas of study being genetic differences in drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.</p><p>In humans, there are two phases of xenobiotic (ie, substances foreign to the body) metabolism that are controlled by several hundred drug metabolizing enzymes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77320 \">figure 1</a>), and their corresponding genes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During phase I metabolism, polar groups are added to lipophilic molecules by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis to facilitate water-solubility. This group of reactions is catalyzed predominantly by the cytochrome P450 superfamily of mixed function oxidases (CYPs), which represent a classic example of polymorphic (ie, occurring in different types) drug metabolizing enzymes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs and the liver: Metabolism and mechanisms of injury&quot;, section on 'Phase I reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following phase I metabolism, most compounds are still insufficiently hydrophilic for excretion, and require further processing (phase II reactions result) to form readily excretable, nontoxic substances. An example of a polymorphic phase II drug metabolizing enzyme is thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT), which is involved in the metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Sequencing of the human genome has revealed 58 different human CYP genes, which encode various CYP isoenzymes. Information on human CYP P450 genes is available online at <a href=\"http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/cytochromeP450.html&amp;token=p2WEkhZPztqSBvR3LEmTe5N3vGgNKoCcww4H5a2iAVehYU+LaVOVLwm37fDmOg8o7hyXvaYPXHs8FAjSUvx4RQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2904\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/cytochromeP450.html</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>CYP enzyme activity can be affected by genetic and environmental factors. One of the more common environmental influences occurs through drug-drug interactions. A common example is induction or inhibition of CYP3A4 caused by administration of a drug, which in turn alters the metabolism of a second drug. This subject is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs and the liver: Metabolism and mechanisms of injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More applicable to the field of pharmacogenomics is the fact that the majority of the CYP genes encoding for enzymes that are active in xenobiotic metabolism are polymorphic, and polymorphisms that affect drug metabolism are seen in a significant portion of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/29,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36-38</a>]. In many cases, the frequency varies according to ethnic background. As an example, expression of CYP2D6 is functionally absent in 7 percent of Caucasians and African-Americans, while deficiency is rare among Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Due to the importance of these genes, a website has been created that is continuously updated for newly identified CYP polymorphisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Polymorphisms in CYP genes may contribute to either diminished or absent metabolism, or excessive metabolism of a compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In general, genotypic CYP variations result in three metabolic phenotypes: ultra-rapid metabolizers, extensive (normal) metabolizers, and poor metabolizers.</p><p>The clinically most important polymorphic variations in hepatic CYPs are seen in the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 genes, which code for enzymes that are responsible for the phase I metabolism of approximately 60 to 70 percent of all therapeutic medications used in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216886\"><span class=\"h4\">Clopidogrel and CYP2C19 variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adverse in vivo effects of reduced function CYP2C19 alleles on benefit from the anti-platelet agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> have been demonstrated in a number of studies and a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In March 2010, a boxed warning from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was issued to alert clinicians that genetic testing is available to identify individuals with poor metabolizer variants of CYP2C19 who may not receive the full benefits of clopidogrel and require dose adjustment or use of a different drug, although the FDA did not explicitly recommend genotyping patients prior to starting therapy. Two subsequent meta-analyses, which included more recently published reports and had more stringent definitions of adverse events, did not show a correlation between CYP2C19 genotype and adverse cardiovascular events in patients treated with clopidogrel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

Among the reasons for lack of implementation are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitations in the design of published pharmacogenetic studies (in particular, the lack of prospective randomized trials demonstrating improved clinical outcomes when drug therapy or specific dose is selected on the basis of genotype)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulatory and ethical concerns</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of cost effectiveness analyses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitations in the number of available pharmacogenetic tests and lack of guidelines for test implementation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lack of education on the benefits of pharmacogenetic testing, both for patients and providers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential for delay in therapy while awaiting results of genotyping</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3654047\"><span class=\"h2\">Study design limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several problems in study design have limited the translation of pharmacogenetics into the clinical sphere.</p><p>The initially reported genetic and pharmacogenetic associations often have not been reproducible (ie, many of the initial reports represented &quot;false-positive&quot; findings) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. In many cases, the original pharmacogenetic studies were &quot;spin-offs&quot; from clinical trials and, thus, were underpowered for genetic association studies given the small sample sizes allocated to a given treatment arm. Replication of results from genome-wide association studies requires identification of a large and appropriate sample, and this can be both difficult and expensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Another contributor to the failure to replicate initial findings is heterogeneity among studies, which can be phenotypic (ie, the selective use of different endpoints, times of assessment, types of interventions, and genetic groups across studies) or genotypic (ie, evaluation of disparate markers within the same gene or varying genetic allele frequencies due to ethnicity, which may be overt or subtle).</p><p>The problems of phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity can be illustrated by an evaluation of the pharmacogenetic associations of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2, OMIM 109690) gene with the response to beta2-agonist therapy in asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. In a review of 21 studies that focused on the two most common ADRB2 coding variants (Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu), the total number of statistically significant probed and reported associations was 487 when the multiple endpoints and types of comparisons presented by the various studies were considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, 465 (95 percent) were probed only once; six associations were probed twice, and only two of the associations were probed five times for the same endpoint, time of assessment, type of intervention, and genetic group. When the data were reanalyzed, adjusting for the number of comparisons, only 38 of the original 487 associations (8 percent) were statistically significant for the comparison between all available genetic groups. Heterogeneity in the available data precludes a definitive conclusion regarding the utility of ADRB2 variants to guide asthma therapy.

Genetic variations in the <em>TPMT</em> gene can result in functional inactivation of the enzyme and a markedly increased risk of life-threatening treatment-associated myelosuppression. However, the homozygous variant of <em>TPMT</em> associated with functional inactivation occurs at a very low frequency among Caucasians (only approximately 1 in 300).

From an ethics perspective, a longstanding concern has been whether the identification of pharmacogenetic variants (in particular those associated with a poor treatment response or prognosis) in an individual could result in stigmatization (eg, denial of insurance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>A major step in the protection of individuals' rights came with the passage of H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. This law protects Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information in matters related to health insurance and employment and should translate into increased acceptance of pharmacogenetic testing by the public in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3654061\"><span class=\"h2\">Lack of cost-effectiveness analyses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circumstances that favor cost effectiveness of a pharmacogenetic test include a high prevalence of the genetic variant of interest in the target population, a good correlation between phenotype and genotype, satisfactory diagnostic test criteria, a disease that is associated with significant morbidity or mortality if left untreated, and a significant reduction in adverse drug reactions resulting from testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Despite the multitude of pharmacogenetic association studies in the literature, relatively few cost-effective analyses have been performed.

VKORC1 variants account for approximately 25 percent of the phenotypic variability in warfarin dosing, with CYP2C9 variants adding an additional 6 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The available data suggest that combining knowledge of genetic variants with clinical characteristics can explain between 55 and 71 percent of the variability in warfarin dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>].</p><p>A 2006 working paper from the American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies (and partially published in 2008) estimated that formally integrating genetic testing into routine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy could allow American warfarin users to avoid 85,000 serious bleeding events and 17,000 strokes annually, resulting in estimated savings of $1.1 billion annually, with a range of about $100 million to $2 billion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. However, routine genotyping is not widely accepted (or recommended in guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]), especially after randomized trials that compared genotype-guided initial dosing with standard initial dosing found no differences in rates of bleeding or thromboembolism.

The authors concluded that on the basis of available data and cost of testing (about $400 in 2007), there was only a 10 percent chance that genotype-guided dosing is likely to be cost-effective (ie, &lt;$50,000 per QALY).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3654068\"><span class=\"h2\">Lack of tests and guidelines for test implementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When compared to other clinical tests, pharmacogenetic testing is relatively precise because of the stability of DNA in the laboratory, the fact that germline DNA does not change in an individual's lifetime, and the robust nature of the available genetic tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Nevertheless, relatively few pharmacogenetic tests are available for use in clinical practice, and even when tests are available, there has been slow adoption of these tests to inform clinical decision making in practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Limitations cited in the development and implementation of new tests include the difficulty of identifying and incorporating multiple (interacting) variants in the same test, the translation of a test developed based upon average population responses to the case of a specific individual, the need to develop tests that can be interpreted within a clinical context, the need for a test associated with biologically meaningful differences, the need for tests to undergo formal regulatory approval (eg, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) in the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pharmacogenomics/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>], and the lack of clear, peer-reviewed evidence-based guidelines that translate laboratory test results into actionable prescribing decisions for specific drugs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3654075\"><span class=\"h2\">Need to educate patients and providers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacogenomics and the promise of personalized medicine is frequently mentioned in the popular lay press. It is therefore incumbent upon both the developers of a given pharmacogenetic test as well as the health care professionals responsible for ordering the test to be cognizant of the test characteristics and interpretation, and to be able to effectively disseminate that information to patients. As noted above, a crucial part of testing efforts should be directed toward the meaning of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, providing reassurance regarding the safety and privacy of testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized medicine&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3654054\" class=\"local\">'Regulatory and ethical concerns'</a> above.)</p><p>There is also a need for educating health care providers in both the broad array of potential predictive tools and the strengths and weaknesses of these tools.

The context for these educational efforts is not yet clear. </p><p>The use of biomarkers in clinical practice may lead a paradigm shift in patient management. Providers will potentially need to perform a diagnostic test prior to prescribing a drug to determine which drug is best suited to each individual patient.
