This epidemiologic pattern reflects the changing nature of the antigenic properties of influenza viruses, and their subsequent spread depends upon multiple factors, including transmissibility of the virus and the susceptibility of the population. </p><p>The epidemiology of influenza, including morbidity and mortality, will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, complications, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of this infection are discussed separately; the epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 influenza (&quot;swine influenza&quot;) and avian influenza are also presented elsewhere.

Among influenza A viruses that infect humans, three major subtypes of hemagglutinins (H1, H2, and H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidases (N1 and N2) have been described. Influenza B viruses have a lesser propensity for antigenic changes, and only antigenic drifts in the hemagglutinin have been described. Influenza C has been reported to cause acute respiratory illnesses in children and, more rarely, in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Influenza hemagglutinin is a surface glycoprotein that binds to sialic acid residues on respiratory epithelial cell surface glycoproteins. This interaction is necessary for the initiation of infection. After viral replication, progeny virions are also bound to the host cell. Neuraminidase cleaves these links and liberates the new virions; it also counteracts hemagglutinin-mediated self-aggregation entrapment in respiratory secretions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1200927955\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF ANTIGENIC SHIFTS AND DRIFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major changes in the envelope glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase, are referred to as antigenic shifts, and minor changes are called antigenic drifts. Antigenic shifts are associated with epidemics and pandemics of influenza A, whereas antigenic drifts are associated with more localized outbreaks of varying extent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIGENIC SHIFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Influenza viruses have a segmented genome that can result in high rates of reassortment among viruses coinfecting the same cell. Reassortment between animal and human viruses may result in the emergence of pandemic strains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52181 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Such reassortment events led to the emergence of the viruses that caused the pandemics of 1957, 1968, and 2009. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Reassortment between different influenza viruses does not always result in a pandemic. As an example, a novel reassortant strain of influenza A H1N2 viruses appeared in humans in the 2001 to 2002 season in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia and caused seasonal epidemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>There was concern that reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses might have occurred when avian influenza <span class=\"nowrap\">A/H5N1</span> infections were detected in humans in Hong Kong in March 1997 at the time of an extensive outbreak of avian influenza <span class=\"nowrap\">A/H5N1</span> in poultry. However, such a reassortant virus was not found. Nevertheless, the potential for such reassortment remains a concern, given the high mortality of avian influenza <span class=\"nowrap\">A/H5N1</span> infections in humans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of avian influenza&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many historians agree that the first recognition of an influenza pandemic was in 1510 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The H3N2v influenza virus contains the M gene from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus, which may confer increased transmissibility to and among humans compared with other swine-origin influenza viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, sustained human-to-human transmission of this strain has not been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Almost all patients reported direct or indirect contact with swine, and the majority attended fairs where swine were present. Most patients have had mild illness.

Receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine did not provide substantial rates of seroprotection against these strains.

Since then, annual epidemics have occurred during influenza season. Avian influenza A H7N9 is discussed in detail separately.

Outbreaks due to antigenic drifts are usually less extensive and severe than the epidemics or pandemics associated with antigenic shifts. Antigenic drifts are believed to result from point mutations in the RNA gene segments that code for the hemagglutinin or the neuraminidase; they are thought to occur sequentially as the virus spreads through a susceptible population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Changes in the hemagglutinin that result in antigenic shifts are of such great magnitude that they cannot be accounted for by point mutations alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extremely severe and extensive pandemic of 1918 and 1919 resulted in 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide and was exceptional in the high death rates that were seen among healthy adults aged 15 to 34 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. A similarly high death rate has not occurred in this age group in either prior or subsequent influenza A pandemics or epidemics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenicity of the hemagglutinin of the 1918 pandemic virus was directly demonstrated in a mouse model using genetic recombination techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Researchers constructed influenza viruses using hemagglutinin alone or hemagglutinin with neuraminidase from the pandemic strain. Both recombinant viruses led to widespread infection of the lungs, suggesting that hemagglutinin conferred enhanced pathogenicity in mice. Furthermore, these recombinant viruses could induce high levels of chemokines and cytokines, resulting in inflammatory cell infiltration and severe hemorrhage that were characteristic of the illness seen during the pandemic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scientists used reverse genetics to create an influenza virus with all eight gene segments of the 1918 pandemic strain in order to study its virulence in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After infection, the 1918 strain produced 39,000 times more virus particles in the lungs of mice compared with more contemporary H1N1 influenza strains. Furthermore, the ability of an influenza virus to replicate in the absence of protease is thought to be a critical determinant of pathogenicity in animal models; the 1918 strain was able to replicate equally well in the absence or presence of trypsin in vitro.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scientists have fully sequenced the entire genome of the 1918 strain, which has given insight into the origins of the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In the pandemics of 1957 and 1968, two to three gene segments from avian strains combined with the circulating human strain to form a reassortant virus. The influenza virus that caused the 2009 pandemic was caused by a quadruple reassortment of two swine strains, one human strain, and one avian strain. In contrast, sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 1918 virus genome suggest that it was derived wholly from an ancestor that originally infected birds and adapted to humans. Some amino acid changes identified in the 1918 strain are also seen in H5N1 and H7N7 avian viruses that have caused human fatalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of avian influenza&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF INFLUENZA OUTBREAKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Influenza outbreaks have a seasonal distribution and characteristic time course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Factors influencing the extent and severity of an outbreak are less clear. Two or three different influenza strains typically circulate concurrently in a given influenza season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>One factor that may influence which influenza strains will predominate during an influenza season is the seroprotection rate among children during the preceding season. In a study in which children and adults were tested for antibodies to locally circulating influenza strains during three consecutive influenza seasons (2006 to 2007, 2007 to 2008, and 2008 to 2009), the lowest rates of seroprotection in children (but not in adults) coincided with the dominant influenza subtype during the following winter epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The authors suggest that the protection rate in children is important for shaping future epidemics because children are prolific disseminators of respiratory virus infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outbreaks of influenza occur almost exclusively during the winter months in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (which occur at different times of the year) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60877 \">figure 1</a>). It is highly unusual to detect influenza A viruses at other times, although individual infections and even outbreaks have been reported during the warm weather months.</p><p>Travelers to tropical regions should be reminded that influenza may occur throughout the year in the tropics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a study of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection from 85 countries, more than one influenza epidemic period per year was more common in tropical countries (41 percent) than in temperate countries (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Year-round activity occurred in 3 of 43 temperate countries (7 percent), 1 of 6 subtropical countries (17 percent), and 11 of 30 tropical countries (37 percent).</p><p>In addition, summertime outbreaks of influenza have occurred on cruise ships in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Volume of airline travel has been linked to transnational spread of influenza infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Repeat vaccination is not necessary in travelers who received routine vaccination at the appropriate time in the previous fall or winter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-travel#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for travel&quot;, section on 'Influenza vaccine'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-with-vaccines#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines&quot;, section on 'Travelers'</a>.)</p><p>How influenza A virus persists between outbreaks remains poorly understood. It is possible that sporadic cases of viral infection at other times are caused by influenza but not diagnosed as such or that virus is imported from geographically distant sites, in which outbreaks are occurring, by the travel of infected individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course of an outbreak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Influenza A outbreaks typically begin abruptly, peak over a two to three week period, and last for two to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/30,31,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31,36</a>]. In most outbreaks, the earliest indication of influenza activity is an increase in febrile respiratory illnesses in children, followed by increases in influenza-like illnesses in adults. Increases in absenteeism from work and school are usually later manifestations of outbreaks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of seasonal influenza in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most outbreaks have attack rates of 10 to 20 percent in the general population, but rates can exceed 50 percent in pandemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Extraordinarily high attack rates have been reported in institutionalized and semiclosed populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors determining the severity of an outbreak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factors that determine the extent and severity of outbreaks are not fully understood. The susceptibility of the population, as determined by the prevalence of antibodies to circulating virus, clearly plays a major role. Some outbreaks cease when a large pool of susceptible individuals is no longer present in the population. However, some outbreaks appear to end when a large pool of susceptible individuals still exists. It has been suggested that influenza viruses may differ in &quot;intrinsic virulence,&quot; such as their efficiency of transmission or their ability to cause symptomatic infection, as has been shown with the increased pathogenicity of pandemic H1N1 viruses in the ferret model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>There may be variations in disease severity caused by different influenza virus types. In one report, there were no statistically significant differences between influenza A and B infections among hospitalized adults aged &ge;65 years regarding median length of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit, or in-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, in other studies, H3N2 influenza A viruses usually caused the most severe disease, followed by influenza B viruses, and with H1N1 influenza A viruses causing the least severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. Seasons in which both H3N2 influenza A viruses and influenza B viruses cocirculate are associated with higher rates of hospitalization than otherwise expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In contrast, during the 2010 to 2011 influenza season, the pandemic strain of H1N1 influenza A was associated with more severe disease than H3N2 influenza A or influenza B in both children and adults who were hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Similar findings were observed in a study that compared adults hospitalized with the pandemic strain of H1N1 influenza A and those hospitalized with seasonal influenza strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO THE 1918 PANDEMIC STRAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study of 32 individuals born in or before 1915, all had neutralizing antibody responses to the H1N1 influenza strain that caused the 1918 pandemic, even nine decades after its occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Seven of eight individuals tested had circulating B cells that secreted antibodies that bound hemagglutinin (HA) from the 1918 pandemic influenza strain. Monoclonal antibodies that were generated from the B cells of three separate donors had potent neutralizing activity against the 1918 strain and bound to its HA protein with high affinity. They also cross-reacted with the genetically similar HA of a 1930 swine H1N1 influenza strain but did not cross-react with HAs of more contemporary human influenza viruses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN ADULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a modeling study that used vital death records and influenza surveillance data to estimate global influenza-associated respiratory mortality in 33 countries between 1999 and 2015, the estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory excess mortality rate ranged from 0.1 to 6.4 per 100,000 individuals in those &lt;65 years of age, 2.9 to 44.0 per 100,000 in those between 65 and 74 years, and 17.9 to 223.5 per 100,000 in those &ge;75 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The highest mortality rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa (2.8 to 16.5 per 100,000), Southeast Asia (3.5 to 9.2 per 100,000), and among those &ge;75 years of age (51.3 to 99.4 per 100,000). It was estimated that 291,243 to 645,832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually worldwide (4.0 to 8.8 per 100,000). These estimates are higher than previous estimates, likely due to the inclusion of developing countries in the analysis; such countries have been underrepresented in previous studies.</p><p>Other studies have also shown that influenza epidemics generally disproportionately affect older adults, with the highest rates of morbidity and mortality in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/40-42,48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42,48-52</a>]. In a study of the National Hospital Discharge Survey database in the United States, the risk of death during a hospitalization was 1.5-fold higher if the diagnosis was pneumonia compared with 10 other common reasons for admission in the older adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The risk of pneumonia in this age group is increased in patients with comorbid conditions, such as chronic cardiac and pulmonary diseases or diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Excess hospitalizations for patients with chronic diseases who acquire influenza infection range from approximately 20 to more than 1000 per 100,000 individuals, with the highest rates occurring in those less than 5 and more than 64 years of age. Similar findings were noted in a retrospective cohort study of women under the age of 65 with and without chronic medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Rates of hospitalization for acute cardiopulmonary events and mortality were higher during the influenza season, and the presence of other comorbidities increased the risk of hospitalization and death.</p><p>Influenza vaccination was associated with a decrease in hospitalizations for cardiac disease and cerebrovascular disease among a large cohort of patients 65 years and older from three managed care groups compared to members who were not vaccinated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The mortality rate from all causes was also significantly lower among the vaccinated group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Older adults'</a>.)</p><p>Factors that contribute to more severe influenza infections in older adult patients include decreased lung compliance, decreased respiratory muscle strength, declining cellular immunity, and decreased B cell responses to new antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Morbidity and mortality in children are discussed separately.

During the 1918 influenza pandemic, high rates of mortality occurred not only at the extremes of age, but also in young adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75017\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75017 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

In a study using national vital statistics by age in six countries, geographical and temporal pandemic patterns in mortality were compared with the genetic drift of the <span class=\"nowrap\">A/H3N2</span> influenza viruses by analyzing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences from GenBank. In North America, the majority of influenza-related deaths in 1968 to 1969 and 1969 to 1970 occurred during the first pandemic season; in contrast, mortality was delayed until the second pandemic season in Europe and Asia. This phenomenon may be due to higher preexisting neuraminidase immunity (from the <span class=\"nowrap\">A/H2N2</span> era) in Europe and Asia than in North America, combined with a subsequent drift in the neuraminidase antigen during 1969 to 1970.</p><p>Many deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic were thought to be due to secondary bacterial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-influenza/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p>Gaps in preparedness planning for pandemic influenza remain.

This epidemiologic pattern reflects the changing nature of the antigenic properties of influenza viruses, and their subsequent spread depends upon multiple factors, including transmissibility of the virus and the susceptibility of the population. Influenza A viruses, in particular, have a remarkable ability to undergo periodic changes in their antigenic envelope glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major changes in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins are referred to as antigenic shifts, and minor changes are called antigenic drifts. Antigenic shifts are associated with epidemics and pandemics of influenza A, whereas antigenic drifts are associated with more localized outbreaks of varying extent. (See <a href=\"#H1200927955\" class=\"local\">'Definition of antigenic shifts and drifts'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Antigenic shifts'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Antigenic drifts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among influenza A viruses that infect humans, three major subtypes of hemagglutinins (H1, H2, and H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidases (N1 and N2) have been described. Influenza B viruses have a lesser propensity for antigenic changes, and only antigenic drifts in the hemagglutinin have been described. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza viruses have a segmented genome that can result in high rates of reassortment among viruses coinfecting the same cell. Reassortment between animal and human viruses may result in the emergence of pandemic strains. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Antigenic shifts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extremely severe pandemic of 1918 and 1919 was associated with the emergence of antigenic shifts in both the hemagglutinin (H1) and the neuraminidase (N1) of influenza A. Subsequent less severe pandemics occurred in 1957, 1968, 1977, and 2009 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52181 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pandemic of 1918'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Other pandemics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outbreaks of influenza occur almost exclusively during the winter months in the Northern and Southern hemispheres but may occur throughout the year in the tropics. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Seasonality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of high attack rates, the morbidity caused by influenza in the general population is substantial. Increased rates of morbidity and mortality occur at the extremes of age and with underlying comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality in adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although death rates from influenza are usually disproportionately higher among older adult individuals and infants during influenza epidemics, a shift in the age distribution is seen during pandemics. During pandemics, higher rates of mortality occur not only at the extremes of age but also in young adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75017\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75017 \">figure 2</a>).
