They work by teaching your body how to fight the germs that cause infections. Thanks to vaccines, the number of people &ndash; especially kids &ndash; who die because of infections has gone way down. Vaccines have also reduced the number of people crippled by polio and other infections that can cause permanent damage.</p><p>Vaccines usually come in shots, but some come in nasal sprays or medicines you swallow. Vaccines are also called &quot;vaccinations&quot; or &quot;immunizations.&quot;</p><p>Some vaccines work after just 1 dose. Others work only after 2 or more doses. Vaccines usually take a couple of weeks to start working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393340180\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should I get vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting vaccinated can help keep you from getting sick. If you do get sick, being vaccinated can also keep you from getting severely ill. Plus, being vaccinated can help protect those around you from getting sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393340187\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects do vaccines cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often vaccines cause no side effects. When they do cause side effects, they can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, mild swelling, or soreness where you got the shot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache or body aches</p><p/><p>Vaccines also sometimes cause more serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions. But serious side effects are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393340194\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I be vaccinated and for what?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People need different vaccines at different stages of their life:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and children usually need vaccines against infections that strike at any time in life. Childhood vaccines include those against measles, mumps, rubella, and polio.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children older than 6 months and adults need a flu vaccine every year. Some adults also need a vaccine against the most common type of pneumonia (a lung infection). Plus, adults sometimes need vaccines that they never got as children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travelers sometimes need vaccines against infections that exist in the area to which they are traveling.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393340201\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, ask your doctor or nurse if you need any vaccines. Some vaccines must be given before pregnancy. Others are important to get during pregnancy. Getting the right vaccines before and during pregnancy can protect you and your baby from serious infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393340208\"><span class=\"h1\">Do vaccines cause autism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. After doing many careful studies, scientists have <strong>not</strong> found any link between vaccines and autism. Many years ago, one study said there was a link between autism and vaccines. But that study turned out to be false. It has been withdrawn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393340215\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have an egg allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People sometimes worry about this. That's because some forms of the flu vaccine contain small amounts of egg. But the amount is so small that it does not cause an allergic reaction. If you have an egg allergy, you should still get the flu vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393340336\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tdap-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tdap vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-with-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults with HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-during-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccination during pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?
