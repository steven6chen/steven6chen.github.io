In contrast to most other filtered solutes, only 10 percent of filtered magnesium is absorbed in the proximal tubule; most (50 to 70 percent) of the filtered magnesium is passively reabsorbed in the cortical aspect of the thick ascending limb of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Magnesium reabsorption at this site is paracellular and voltage dependent, mediated by the tight junction proteins, claudin-16 and claudin-19. Loop reabsorption is appropriately diminished with magnesium loading, thereby allowing the excess magnesium to be excreted in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The causes and treatment of hypermagnesemia are reviewed in this topic. The symptoms of hypermagnesemia, the normal regulation of magnesium balance, and the different units used to measure the plasma magnesium concentration are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-of-hypermagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptoms of hypermagnesemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-magnesium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of magnesium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF HYPERMAGNESEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficiency of the renal response to a magnesium load is such that hypermagnesemia is primarily seen in two settings: when renal function is impaired <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when a large magnesium load is given, whether intravenously, orally, or as an enema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypermagnesemia can be seen in 10 to 15 percent of hospitalized patients, usually in the setting of renal failure. Plasma magnesium levels rise as renal function declines since there is no magnesium regulatory system other than urinary excretion. The typical patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), for example, has a plasma magnesium concentration of 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (2.4 to 3.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. In patients on dialysis, the plasma magnesium concentration is primarily determined by magnesium intake. This was shown in a cross-sectional study of patients on hemodialysis who completed a dietary questionnaire; the correlation between estimated dietary magnesium intake and the serum magnesium was 0.87 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, hypermagnesemia (defined as a serum magnesium greater than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> occurred with magnesium intakes as low as 281 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which is considerably lower than the average intake in the general population. Severe and symptomatic hypermagnesemia can also be induced when exogenous magnesium is given as antacids or laxatives in usual therapeutic doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, these drugs are contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnesium infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral magnesium is commonly used to decrease neuromuscular excitability in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia. The usual plasma concentration achieved is 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (6 to 8.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 2.5 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> but much higher levels can occur. There are few prospective studies of complications associated with this regimen, but maternal hypocalcemia (since hypermagnesemia can suppress the release of parathyroid hormone) and hyperkalemia have been described, as have neonatal hypocalcemia, hypotonia, osteopenia, and an increased rate of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-of-hypermagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptoms of hypermagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral ingestion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Massive oral ingestion can occasionally exceed renal excretory capacity, particularly if there is underlying renal insufficiency. Severe hypermagnesemia with life-threatening symptoms has been described with accidental poisoning with Epsom salts (almost 100 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>) in children, in laxative abusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and during the treatment of a variety of drug overdoses using magnesium as a cathartic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. A fatal case of hypermagnesemia has been reported in an adult following excessive repeated Epsom salts gargles for halitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Prospective studies of repetitive magnesium catharsis demonstrated that the usual total average dose of 960 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a> (9.22 g) induced a mean elevation in the plasma magnesium concentration to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> with 10 percent of patients exceeding 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (3.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An elevation in the plasma magnesium concentration is much more likely in the presence of gastrointestinal disorders (active ulcer disease, gastritis, colitis) that can enhance magnesium absorption. In one retrospective study of hospital admissions, for example, eight cases of severe hypermagnesemia (plasma magnesium concentration above 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> were seen over a five-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These patients were of older age, taking normal amounts of magnesium as a cathartic or antacid, did not have significant renal insufficiency, but did have active gastrointestinal disease. The hypermagnesemia was unsuspected despite presentation with severe symptoms, including hypocalcemia, hypotension, and respiratory depression. Prolonged hypermagnesemia in constipated patients with colonic retention has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Extreme hypermagnesemia in conjunction with hypercalcemia is seen as a unique feature of Dead Sea water poisoning since the ingested water contains very high concentrations of both magnesium and calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnesium enemas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substantial quantities of magnesium can be absorbed from the large bowel following a magnesium enema. In normal subjects, for example, 400 to 800 mmol of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> per rectum can raise the plasma magnesium concentration to as high as 6 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (7.2 to 19.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 3 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Among patients with renal failure, the administration of a magnesium enema can be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscellaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild hypermagnesemia can occur in a variety of other clinical settings in selected cases.

In most such cases, initial treatment consists of cessation of magnesium-containing medications and therapy with intravenous isotonic fluids (eg, normal saline) plus a loop diuretic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>). Higher diuretic doses may be required in these patients since they have reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
