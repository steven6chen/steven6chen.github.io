It is typically self-limited, resolving within one to three weeks. Symptoms result from inflammation of the lower respiratory tract and are most frequently due viral infection.</p><p>Treatment is focused on patient education and supportive care. Antibiotics are not needed for the great majority of patients with acute bronchitis but are greatly overused for this condition. Reducing antibiotic use for acute bronchitis is a national and international healthcare priority. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Avoiding antibiotic overuse'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of acute bronchitis are addressed here.

The bacteria most commonly associated with acute bronchitis include <em>Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>].</p><p>Among these bacteria, <em>B. pertussis </em>is the most likely to cause prolonged cough. The overall incidence of pertussis and associated outbreaks are rising worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In patients with prolonged cough, reported rates of pertussis range from 1 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Pertussis is one of the few bacterial causes of acute bronchitis that may respond to antibiotic therapy.</p><p><em>M. pneumoniae</em> and C<em>. pneumoniae</em> are each common causes of upper respiratory tract infections. While each has the potential to cause lower respiratory tract infection, including both acute bronchitis and pneumonia, rates of prolonged cough or acute bronchitis caused by these bacteria vary among cases series, ranging from 0 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15</a>].</p><p><em>Bordetella bronchiseptica</em>, the cause of kennel cough in dogs, is a rarely reported but likely under-recognized cause of cough in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Most infections occur in immunocompromised individuals exposed to farms or pets, although infections in immunocompetent patients and hospital-acquired transmission have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/16,17,19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,19-25</a>].</p><p>There is no convincing evidence to support the concept of &quot;acute bacterial bronchitis,&quot; caused by pathogens such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, or other gram-negative bacilli in adults without airway violations (eg, tracheostomy, endotracheal intubation) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of infection in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cough is the cardinal symptom in patients presenting with acute bronchitis. By definition, the cough lasts at least 5 days, although, in most patients, it persists for 1 to 3 weeks, with a median duration of 18 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/3,12,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,26</a>]. The cough may be associated with either purulent or nonpurulent sputum production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>]. The presence of purulent sputum is a nonspecific finding and does not appear to be predictive of bacterial infection or response to antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common cold) can precede the onset of acute bronchitis. During the first few days of illness, symptoms associated with these two conditions such as headache, nasal congestion, and sore throat can overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>]. With involvement of the lower respiratory tract, cough becomes the predominant symptom.</p><p>Wheezing and mild dyspnea may accompany the cough. Both wheezing and rhonchi may be auscultated on physical examination; rhonchi usually clear with coughing. Although pulmonary function testing is typically not indicated in clinical practice, bronchospasm, evidenced by reduced FEV<sub>1</sub>, has been reported in 40 percent of patients in a small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and bronchial hyperreactivity can be demonstrated with provocative testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is typically transient, resolving in six weeks, and is believed to be the mechanism that underlies the persistent cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/7,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,30</a>].</p><p>With prolonged coughing, chest wall or substernal pain can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>]. Other complications are rare; most common among them are the development of pneumonia or bacterial superinfection. For most patients, acute bronchitis is a self-limited illness that does not require specific diagnostic testing or treatment.</p><p>Certain clinical features suggest a specific cause or an alternate diagnosis that may require antimicrobial therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114182 \">table 1</a>). For example, paroxysms of cough accompanied by an inspiratory whoop or posttussive emesis suggest pertussis, particularly during known outbreaks. Fever, or other systemic symptoms, are rare in patients with acute bronchitis. These findings, in addition to cough and sputum production, should raise suspicion for influenza or pneumonia. On physical examination, signs of parenchymal consolidation such as dullness to percussion, decreased or bronchial breath sounds, rales, egophony, or signs of pleural inflammation such as a pleural rub suggest that disease extends beyond the bronchi, and chest imaging should be considered.

For most patients, the diagnosis can be made based upon the history and physical examination. Testing is generally reserved for cases in which pneumonia is suspected, clinical diagnosis is uncertain, or when results would change management (eg, a positive influenza test result in a patient who meets criteria for antiviral therapy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest radiographs are unlikely to change management for most patients with acute cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In patients with acute bronchitis, chest radiographs are either normal or findings are nonspecific, though subtle changes consistent with thickening of the bronchial walls in the lower lobes are occasionally reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The primary reason for obtaining a chest radiograph is to exclude pneumonia; reasonable indications for suspecting pneumonia and obtaining imaging include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal vital signs (pulse <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100/minute,</span> respiratory rate &gt;24 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute,</span> temperature &gt;38&deg;C [100.4&deg;F], or oxygen saturation &lt;95 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of consolidation on chest examination (rales, egophony, or tactile fremitus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental status or behavioral changes in patients &gt;75 years old, who may not mount a fever</p><p/><p>Additional factors, such as moderate or severe dyspnea, hemoptysis, immunocompromise, older age, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dementia, may raise the likelihood of pneumonia or other underlying pulmonary disorders.

When confirmation is desired based on patient risk status or public health concern, multiple testing options are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83305 \">figure 1</a>). Selection of the most appropriate test varies by duration of cough.

Culture of the organism from the affected site is the gold standard for diagnosis. Use of specialized transport and culture media us preferred when testing for <em>B. bronchiseptica</em>,<em> </em>and laboratories should be informed in advance when this organism is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Testing should only be obtained at centers where results can be obtained in a timely manner. </p><p>No study has directly evaluated use of procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic decisionmaking in patients with acute bronchitis. However, three within-study subgroup analyses involving a total of 338 patients with acute bronchitis have each shown a reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use when procalcitonin algorithms were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Several larger randomized trials and meta-analyses inclusive of patients with acute respiratory tract infections of all kinds have shown that use of procalcitonin-guided decisionmaking for antibiotic treatment was associated with a reduction in antibiotic exposure (median 8 to 4 days) without an increase in 30-day treatment failure or all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/47-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-53</a>].</p><p>The use of procalcitonin in the diagnostic evaluation of pneumonia is discussed separately.

Selection of an OTC medication should take into account patient comorbidities and drug interactions. As an example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may enhance the serotonergic effect of dextromethorphan. Although the benefits of these medications for symptom improvement in patients with acute bronchitis are uncertain, multiple clinical practice guidelines suggest that offering medications for symptom relief may help reduce requests for antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/1,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,57</a>]. No randomized trials have directly evaluated the use of antitussives in patients with acute bronchitis, and a large systematic review of OTC medications for acute cough, including 19 trials in over 3000 adults primarily with the common cold, concluded that there is no strong evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC cough medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. However, some patients may benefit, and our recommendation is in line with the American College of Physicians and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statement on appropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infection in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We specifically avoid use of opioid cough suppressants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>, due to their addictive potential and side effect profile.</p><p/><p>We suggest limiting use of inhaled beta-agonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, and reserve their use for patients with wheezing and underlying pulmonary disease. A single randomized controlled trial evaluating 42 adults with acute bronchitis showed reduced rates of cough at 7 days in patients taking inhaled albuterol compared with placebo (61 versus 91 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. About one-half of patients in this trial had wheezing at baseline. When this trial was analyzed in a meta-analysis of studies comparing other oral beta-agonists as well as other inhaled beta-agonists, similar reductions in cough were not detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>We suggest not using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, oral corticosteroids, or herbal remedies for cough related to acute bronchitis, either due to lack of efficacy or safety concerns.

A systematic review found no quality randomized trials to support the use of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis, with a note of concern about side effects and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. A liquid herbal preparation derived from the roots of <em>Pelargonium sidoides</em> (EPs 7630) appears to shorten the duration of symptoms in acute bronchitis based on two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]; however, these trials were determined to be low quality and concerns have been raised about potential liver injury with its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-bronchitis-in-adults/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2871710850\"><span class=\"h3\">For concurrent cold symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with acute bronchitis have associated symptoms of the common cold, particularly early in the course of illness.

It is typically self-limited, resolving within one to three weeks. By definition, patients with acute bronchitis do not have underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (See <a href=\"#H3245585097\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of cases of acute bronchitis are caused by infection with respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. Bacteria are rare causes, accounting for &lt;10 percent of cases. The most common bacterial causes are <em>Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, </em>and<em> Chlamydia pneumoniae. </em>(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, the diagnosis can be made based on history and physical examination, and additional testing is not needed.

Reasonable indications for suspecting pneumonia and obtaining imaging include abnormal vital signs (pulse <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100/minute,</span> respiratory rate &gt;24 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute,</span> temperature &gt;38&deg;C [100.4&deg;F], or oxygen saturation &lt;95 percent), signs of consolidation on lung examination (rales, egophony, or tactile fremitus), and mental status changes in patients &gt;75 years old. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment should focus on patient education and supportive care. We encourage having a discussion on the expected course of illness and treatment plan with all patients.
