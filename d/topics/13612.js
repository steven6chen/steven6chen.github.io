PDT was developed primarily for treatment of cancer and precancers. While PDT has been used to treat internal cancers in many parts of the body by administering a systemic photosensitizer and delivering light through an optical fiber, by far the most common application of PDT in clinical medicine is for treatment of cancer and precancer of the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review the principles and practical applications of PDT for treating neoplastic and preneoplastic conditions of the skin. The use of PDT in oncology and internal medicine is discussed in specific topic reviews. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer#H204695537\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of superficial esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'ER plus PDT'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-photodynamic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Treatment with photodynamic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial photodynamic therapy in the management of airway disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3578459214\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES AND MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all drugs used for PDT are derivatives of heme (porphyrins), large tetrapyrrole molecules produced in the mitochondria of all cells. Porphyrins are products of a well-known biochemical pathway, catalyzed by eight enzymes that can be genetically disrupted in the various forms of hereditary porphyria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, PDT can be considered a form of &quot;artificial porphyria.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because porphyrins are conjugated (containing multiple double bonds), they can absorb visible wavelengths of light very efficiently and convert the energy into chemical reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Historically, the earliest PDT drugs for medical use were derived from hemoglobin (eg, hematoporphyrin derivative, benzoporphyrin derivative) and other compounds with structural similarities to heme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in dermatology, the use of such preformed photosensitizers has been largely replaced by prodrugs that represent the second step in the porphyrin synthesis pathway, namely 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or an esterified form, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyl-aminolevulinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyl aminolevulinate</a> (MAL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113765%7EDERM%2F113767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113765 graphicRef113767 \">figure 2A-B</a>). </p><p>ALA or MAL are applied topically, taken up by neoplastic cells, and converted into various porphyrins; protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) is the form that absorbs light most efficiently. This approach to PDT works because ALA bypasses the first (inhibitory) feedback step in the heme synthesis pathway, thus allowing PPIX to accumulate to very high levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113765 \">figure 2A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Most uses of PDT involve the topical application of ALA or MAL to the skin for several hours to allow the buildup of PPIX within target cancer or precancer cells, followed by illumination with a prescribed amount of light (delivered from an approved broadband lamp or a laser) to activate the PPIX. The photoactivation of PPIX, in the presence of oxygen, causes free radical-based photochemical reactions within mitochondria and surrounding membranes, ultimately leading to the death of the target cells. To achieve good photoactivation, the chosen light source must emit sufficient energy at wavelengths that correspond to major peaks in the absorption spectrum of PPIX. Typically, 400 nm (blue) or 635 nm (red) are chosen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113767 \">figure 2B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3059112246\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR EFFECTS OF PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perhaps the most important principle in PDT is its high selectivity for neoplastic cells and tissues. Even when the prodrug is applied over a very broad area of skin, cancerous or precancerous cells accumulate far more protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) than do normal epidermal cells for two reasons: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher rates of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminolevulinic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminolevulinic acid</a> uptake </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher rates of synthesis and accumulation of PPIX within the mitochondria </p><p/><p>Reasons for the last include tumor-selective changes in expression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> activity of critical enzymes within the heme synthesis pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The selective PPIX accumulation in tumor tissue in vivo, relative to surrounding normal skin, has been clearly demonstrated using animal models of squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], squamous precarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and basal cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], as well as by noninvasive PPIX measurements in human actinic keratoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Upon illumination, the consequence of the selectively higher target PPIX levels is preferential photodestruction of the cancer tissue relative to neighboring normal skin cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Early research in PDT focused on the physical and biochemical mechanisms by which PDT kills cancer cells, with an assumption that high intracellular PPIX levels and a high light intensity (fluence rate) are necessary for good tumor killing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in vivo investigations and clinical experience show that both lower PPIX and light intensities also work quite well, suggesting that previously unrecognized mechanisms as well as the participation of the immune system may be critical for generating a therapeutic response to PDT. (See <a href=\"#H1104456584\" class=\"local\">'Variations on the standard photodynamic therapy regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>One important consequence of the mitochondrial membrane-targeted mechanism by which PDT kills neoplastic cells is that PDT is nonmutagenic. This gives PDT a distinct advantage over DNA-targeting modalities because, unlike ionizing radiation or many chemotherapeutic agents, PDT can be performed multiple times without fear of introducing oncogenic DNA mutations. Another advantage of PDT is the fact that treated lesions heal without a scar, perhaps due to suppressive effects upon fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Thus, PDT should be considered a nonscarring treatment option for patients who develop frequent nonmelanoma skin cancers and precancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136151401\"><span class=\"h1\">LIGHT SOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The types of visible light that can be used for PDT of the skin are surprisingly varied and include various coherent light sources (lasers and light-emitting diodes), incoherent sources (broadband lamps), and natural sunlight (see <a href=\"#H1104456584\" class=\"local\">'Variations on the standard photodynamic therapy regimen'</a> below). However, efficacy and safety are critical in PDT, and therefore, only validated light sources can be recommended. In the United States, two broadband light sources that target the major absorption peaks of protoporphyrin IX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113767 \">figure 2B</a>) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blue light source (BLU-U 400 nm), to be used with the proprietary <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminolevulinic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminolevulinic acid</a> (ALA) 20% solution (Levulan Kerastick). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A red light source (BF-RhodoLED 635 nm), to be used with the proprietary ALA 10% nanoemulsion (Ameluz). &#160;</p><p/><p>These light sources should be used exclusively with the companion prodrug for which the <span class=\"nowrap\">drug/light</span> combination was tested in the original clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/photodynamic-therapy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Although clinicians may use other light sources, the results are not always predictable.

With this regimen, MAL is applied and then patients are sent outside in the sun for approximately two hours.

(See <a href=\"#H723950437\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PDT involves the application to the skin of a topical prodrug containing aminolevulinate that is converted to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) within target cancer or precancer cells, followed by illumination with red or blue light to activate the PPIX. (See <a href=\"#H3578459214\" class=\"local\">'Principles and mechanisms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1136151401\" class=\"local\">'Light sources'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3422737877\" class=\"local\">'Topical photosensitizing medications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The photoactivation of PPIX by wavelengths of light within the visible spectrum, in the presence of oxygen, results in the death of the target cells. (See <a href=\"#H3059112246\" class=\"local\">'Cellular effects of photodynamic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PDT is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of thin, nonhyperkeratotic actinic keratosis (AK) of the scalp and face. In Europe, Canada, and other countries worldwide, PDT is also approved for the treatment of superficial and thin nodular basal cell carcinoma, when other available therapies are not acceptable, and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. PDT is used off label for the treatment of several skin conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113758 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1221796994\" class=\"local\">'Clinical indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard PDT regimens are available for the treatment of AK on the face and scalp, but these regimens may need to be modified depending on the patient or the skin disease being treated. (See <a href=\"#H3268864624\" class=\"local\">'Standard photodynamic therapy regimens for actinic keratoses'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1104456584\" class=\"local\">'Variations on the standard photodynamic therapy regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain associated with PDT can limit its use, and therefore, efforts should be made to enhance patient comfort without decreasing the therapeutic response. (See <a href=\"#H2388514689\" class=\"local\">'Pain control measures'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Hasan T, Ortel B, Moor AC, Pogue BW.
