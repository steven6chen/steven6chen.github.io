Anxiety and fear meet the criteria for a clinical anxiety disorder when the concerns are persistent and excessive, causing notable distress or impairment in day-to-day life. </p><p>Anxiety disorders are the most common childhood-onset psychiatric disorders. Anxiety disorders in children (up to 12 years old) and adolescents (13 to 18 years old) are associated with educational underachievement and co-occurring psychiatric conditions, as well as functional impairments that can extend into adulthood. </p><p>This topic describes the assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and course of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents are discussed separately. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and course&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216608\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychiatric assessment for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents is performed through a face-to-face diagnostic interview with the child and parents. Detailed information should be obtained on the child&rsquo;s symptoms, their frequency, duration, severity, and degree of distress or interference. It is important to ask about the child&rsquo;s specific thoughts and triggers underlying a particular anxious or avoidant behavior.</p><p>The diagnostic interview should include comprehensive questions pertaining to developmental history, medical history, and family psychiatric history. A detailed social history includes questions about the family relationships, social relationships, school functioning, preferred recreational activities, substance abuse and sexual history if age appropriate. The child&rsquo;s strengths should be assessed. (See <a href=\"#H545216799\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Collateral information from school personnel is often needed, particularly for presentations that pose difficult differential diagnostic questions. Teachers can describe how children respond to separation, interact with their peers, and respond to other stimuli.</p><p>Some children, particularly those with social anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder, may have difficulty participating in the psychiatric assessment. It may be helpful to spend some time building rapport, answering any questions, and providing a description of the assessment experience so the child knows what to expect and what will be expected of them. With younger children, playing a game to build rapport can be helpful.</p><p>Studies suggest that parents and children can differ in their reports on anxiety and other psychiatric symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Parents may not be fully aware of what their child is experiencing. Parents with their own anxiety or depression symptoms may overstate their child&rsquo;s symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Children may not endorse symptoms due to embarrassment, oppositionality, or a wish to give a desirable response. Some children or adolescents may feel more comfortable endorsing symptoms of anxiety and related impairment in a questionnaire rather than in an interview. Children may also display symptoms in some contexts but not others, contributing to differing reports from informants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A multi-informant approach with careful clinician interpretation will yield the most comprehensive and accurate assessment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216631\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinician-assessment instruments and <span class=\"nowrap\">child/parent</span> self-report instruments are used to assess the presence, type, and severity of anxiety symptoms. These tools alone cannot be used to diagnose an anxiety disorder, but can be useful for screening and for monitoring the severity of symptoms over time. </p><p>The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is a 50-item, clinician-rated instrument that assesses symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder in children. The PARS has demonstrated high reliability and good validity in initial testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) is a parent and child self-report instrument that assesses clinical symptoms of anxiety broadly in children. Advantages to the SCARED for clinical practice include no cost for use and short (five-item) version for screening purposes. The SCARED discriminates anxiety from other conditions, including depression, and is sensitive to changes in treatment. Clinical cut-offs on the SCARED have been established as a tool for clinicians or researchers to determine treatment response and symptom remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5 is a new self- and parent-report questionnaire developed to assess anxiety disorder symptoms in children and adolescents according to the current classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216637\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section describes DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence, use of a structured diagnostic interview, and differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216643\"><span class=\"h2\">DSM-5 diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders in children are described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216649\"><span class=\"h3\">Generalized anxiety disorder</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A.

The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (eg, hyperthyroidism).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F.

Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1.

Fear of dying</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Note: Culture-specific symptoms (eg, tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by one month (or more) of one or both of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences (eg, losing control, having a heart attack, &quot;going crazy&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (eg, behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (eg, hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (eg, the panic attacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety disorder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia; in response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in response to reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216718\"><span class=\"h3\">Agoraphobia</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A. Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five situations:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1. Using public transportation (eg, automobiles, buses, trains, ships, planes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>2. Being in open spaces (eg, parking lots, marketplaces, bridges)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>3.

Being outside of the home alone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B. The individual fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (eg, fear of falling in the elderly; fear of incontinence).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C. The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for six months or more.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G.

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder. For example, the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia, situational type; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder), perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance (as in body dysmorphic disorder), reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of separation (as in separation anxiety disorder).</p><p/><p>Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an individual's presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216724\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific phobias</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A. Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (eg, flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C. The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for six months or more.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situations related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder).</p><p/><p>Specifiers based on the phobic stimulus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal (eg, spiders, insects, dogs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Natural environment (eg, heights, storms, water)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood-injection-injury (eg, needles, invasive medical procedures)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Situational (eg, airplanes, elevators, enclosed places)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other (eg, situations that may lead to choking or vomiting; in children, eg, loud sounds or costumed characters)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216747\"><span class=\"h3\">Separation anxiety disorder</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from home or from major attachment figures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about possible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (eg, getting lost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill) that causes separation from a major attachment figure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work, or elsewhere because of fear of separation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures at home or in other settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (eg, headaches, stomachaches, nausea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is anticipated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least four weeks in children and adolescents and typically six months or more in adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder.</p><p/><p>The specifier &ldquo;early onset&rdquo; is added to the diagnosis when the onset of separation anxiety occurs before age six. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216770\"><span class=\"h3\">Selective mutism</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A. Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which there is an expectation for speaking (eg, at school) despite speaking in other situations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B. The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C. The duration of the disturbance is at least one month (not limited to the first month of school).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (eg, childhood onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545216793\"><span class=\"h2\">Structured diagnostic interview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold-standard semi-structured diagnostic interview is the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS) for DSM-IV, Child and Parent Versions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], which has been validated for children ages 7 to 17.
