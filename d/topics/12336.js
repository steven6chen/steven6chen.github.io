For example, persistent excessive daytime sleepiness in a patient with treated obstructive sleep apnea may be due to an underlying circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder as opposed to refractory symptoms despite positive airway pressure therapy.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnostic criteria of the circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders. The classification and diagnosis of other types of sleep disorders are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-sleep-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of sleep disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1509715457\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONS OF THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intrinsic circadian timekeeping system modulates many physiological systems, including daily rhythms in core body temperature, cortisol, and appetite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The circadian system also actively drives wakefulness during the habitual waking day, helping to offset the progressive increase in sleepiness from the sleep homeostatic system, which accumulates sleep pressure across extended wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Sleep homeostatic drive accumulates during wakefulness and promotes the initiation of sleep. After the first half of the sleep episode, this sleep drive rapidly diminishes. A properly-aligned circadian system increases drive for sleep at night, particularly in the latter half of the night, helping to maintain sleep consolidation until normal wake-up time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103729 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In the absence of time information, the intrinsic circadian timekeeping system oscillates with a period slightly longer than 24 hours: about 24.2 hours in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and 24.3 hours in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. To maintain alignment with the 24-hour day, the circadian system must adjust, or phase shift, each day via time cues, also called zeitgebers. The most potent zeitgeber is the environmental light-dark cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The phase shifting effect of bright light on the circadian system is dependent on when light exposure takes place. In normally entrained individuals, light during the last few hours of the typical sleep period and during the early morning moves the circadian rhythm earlier (phase advance). Conversely, light in the evening and first half of the usual sleep period moves the circadian rhythm later (phase delay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2829469546\"><span class=\"h1\">ORIGINS OF CIRCADIAN DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presumed pathophysiology of various circadian disorders relates either to an intrinsic abnormality in the circadian system itself or to extrinsic factors such as air travel or shift work, which require individuals to be awake at times that are out of sync with their intrinsic rhythms. The sleep schedule alignment relative to the 24-hour day varies according to the specific circadian disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F108411\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108411 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1784694403\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrinsic circadian pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four of the circadian disorders are considered intrinsic disorders, with suspected pathophysiology of the circadian system itself.</p><p>Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder and advanced sleep-wake phase disorder are thought to occur due to a misalignment of the intrinsic circadian timing system with the desired sleep schedule. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying cause of the misalignment in delayed sleep-wake phase disorder is not well established and may be multifactorial; proposed factors include developmental changes in sleep-wake timing and lengthening of the intrinsic circadian period during adolescence, changes in light exposure, and altered sensitivity of the circadian system to light. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-sleep-wake-phase-disorder#H6375430\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder arises in part due to physiologic phase advancement that occurs with aging, combined with age-related weakening of circadian rhythms and environmental cues. The disorder may be genetically determined in some individuals and families as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-sleep-wake-phase-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia#H1659188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-wake disturbances and sleep disorders in patients with dementia&quot;, section on 'Circadian rhythms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-sleep-wake-phase-disorder#H3432760918\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.) </p><p/><p>In non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder, there is a failure of the circadian system to maintain stable alignment (called &quot;entrainment&quot;) to the 24-hour day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As a result, the circadian system &quot;free runs&quot; and typically shifts to progressively later phase positions. The most common cause is blindness, as the daily light-dark cycle is the most powerful environmental cue for synchronizing the hypothalamic pacemaker to the 24-hour day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder, the circadian system is thought to lose its modulatory influence on sleep and wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The disorder is most commonly seen in patients with dementia, probably related to both aging and additional disruption of the circadian system by the neurodegenerative process itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia#H1659188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-wake disturbances and sleep disorders in patients with dementia&quot;, section on 'Circadian rhythms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1968776769\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmentally imposed misalignment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jet lag disorder and shift work disorder are considered of extrinsic origin. In jet lag disorder, crossing time zones is associated with a need to sleep and be awake at times that are out of alignment with the circadian system. The severity of the misalignment depends on how many time zones have been crossed and the direction of travel. Since the natural circadian cycle is slightly longer than 24 hours, westbound travel generally causes less disruption, as it is easier to delay than advance the natural circadian cycle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jet-lag#H1638529756\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jet lag&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>In shift work disorder, there is a similar misalignment of the circadian system to the desired sleep and work schedules. For night shift workers, wakefulness is required at a time when the circadian drive for alertness is dissipating and melatonin secretion is rising. Similarly, next-day sleep is being attempted when endogenous circadian rhythms are promoting alertness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers#H9900860\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-wake disturbances in shift workers&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477118688\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Misalignment of the circadian timekeeping system with the desired sleep schedule or impairment of the circadian modulation of sleep and wakefulness often results in clinically significant symptoms of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as impaired physical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1600906447\"><span class=\"h2\">Disrupted sleep-wake pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All circadian disorders are marked by abnormalities in the sleep-wake pattern compared with those of most healthy adults living under similar environmental conditions. The specific patterns vary according to the underlying disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2824080091\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, the circadian system promotes wakefulness until late in the evening. This results in delayed sleep onset, typically occurring at midnight or later (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106126 \">figure 3</a>). If sleep is attempted at an earlier desired bedtime, sleep onset insomnia will result.</p><p>In the morning, the circadian system is actively driving sleep later than conventional or desired wake-up times. Left undisturbed (eg, on weekends or vacation), patients sleep well into the morning, sometimes until noon or later. When conventional rise times are required by school or work, patients with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder have great difficulty waking up and feeling alert. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-sleep-wake-phase-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2388131645\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In advanced sleep-wake phase disorder, patients become sleepy earlier in the evening than conventional or desired bedtimes, and they wake up earlier in the morning and cannot get back to sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F108179\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108179 \">table 1</a>). This pattern of phase advancement occurs physiologically with aging but is more pronounced in patients with pathologic phase advance. When patients force themselves to stay awake in the evening to meet social or progressional obligations, they nonetheless wake up early and thereby accumulate sleep debt. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-sleep-wake-phase-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3662877108\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder have a free-running circadian system, which is usually longer than 24 hours. This results in periods when the circadian system is actively driving wake during the nighttime, resulting in insomnia, and actively driving sleep during the daytime, resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F108178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108178 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>As the clock continues to free run, periods of proper alignment eventually occur, with temporary resolution of the sleep-wake disturbances. Alternatively, patients may simply go to bed later and later each successive night.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290263590\"><span class=\"h3\">Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder, the circadian system fails to consolidate periods of wakefulness and periods of sleep. As a result, there are multiple short sleep episodes spread across the 24-hour day, interspersed with multiple periods of wakefulness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F108177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108177 \">table 3</a>).

Excessive daytime sleepiness also occurs due to reduced total sleep time as well as circadian misalignment. These disturbances persist until the circadian system has adjusted to the new light-dark cycle at the destination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jet-lag#H3613226424\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jet lag&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3087413892\"><span class=\"h3\">Shift work disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shift work disorder manifests as difficulty with sleep or wakefulness at times that are imposed by shifts running counter to the light-dark cycle. As a result, patients accumulate sleep debt and have increased risk for accidents, errors, and other adverse health outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers#H9900884\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-wake disturbances in shift workers&quot;, section on 'Clinical spectrum'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689266318\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any sleep disorder resulting in inadequate duration or quality of sleep, patients can experience impaired functioning in the workplace, at home, or in school. These impairments are thought to result from suboptimal neurobehavioral functioning in domains such as concentration, memory, and processing speed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Physical fatigue may also contribute to impairment.

Comorbid depression is well recognized in association with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder in particular. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-sleep-wake-phase-disorder#H6375492\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;, section on 'Comorbid psychiatric disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3834468599\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, or both are noted in all of the circadian disorders. However, these are nonspecific symptoms that may be caused by a myriad of primary sleep, medical, and psychiatric disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of insomnia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The key to suspecting an underlying circadian disorder is recognition of abnormal sleep-wake patterns, above and beyond the complaint of insomnia or daytime sleepiness (see <a href=\"#H1600906447\" class=\"local\">'Disrupted sleep-wake pattern'</a> above). The age of the patient and comorbidities also help raise or lower suspicion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder commonly begins in adolescence and is rare in older adults, for example, whereas advanced and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorders are primarily found in older adults, particularly those with dementia. Non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder affects blind individuals almost exclusively. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2156265576\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders are predominantly clinical diagnoses. However, in addition to the history, various self-reported and objective measures, including sleep diaries, wrist actigraphy, and melatonin sampling, are of incremental benefit in establishing the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Polysomnography in a sleep laboratory or home sleep apnea testing is not routinely indicated except when suspicion exists for a comorbid sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Patients are asked to keep daily record of each sleep episode, noting parameters such as the bedtime and wake-up time, estimates of the time to fall asleep, the number and duration of awakenings, and the total sleep time. Symptoms such as daytime sleepiness and fatigue may also be recorded in the diary.</p><p>A 24-hour diary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104097\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef104097 \">form 1</a>) or one of several sleep diaries derived from a consensus conference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F87134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859 \">table 7</a>) can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Sleep diaries are required to make the diagnosis of all circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders except for jet lag [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and they are helpful in demonstrating the changes in timing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> quality of sleep and wakefulness. For circadian disorders in particular, review of sleep-wake patterns on both weekdays and weekends (or days off) is important, as the intrinsic circadian rhythm is often most apparent when bedtimes and wake times are not imposed by professional or school obligations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68707068\"><span class=\"h2\">Actigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Actigraphy is acquired using a movement sensor worn continuously on the nondominant wrist, typically for a week or more. Some sensors also detect light. Computer-based algorithms estimate sleep episodes by looking for continuous minutes of low-to-no movement, or spans of time when movement is relatively low compared with movements during presumed ambulatory wakefulness. </p><p>Wrist actigraphy has reasonably good correlation with polysomnography for the parameters of total sleep time and sleep efficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is also a useful method for assessing the timing of sleep episodes as well as the consolidation or fragmentation of sleep episodes over multiple nights (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106126 \">figure 3</a>).

The circadian system signals the pineal gland to produce melatonin typically 90 to 120 minutes prior to habitual bedtime, as long as bright light is not present. Bright light suppresses melatonin secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-available-preparations-of-melatonin#H14100125\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and available preparations of melatonin&quot;, section on 'Circadian rhythm'</a>.)</p><p>The dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] involves periodic sampling of blood or (more commonly) saliva every 30 to 60 minutes, from approximately six hours prior to and one hour following habitual bedtime. The time at which melatonin levels rise above threshold provides a valid and reliable indicator of circadian phase position.</p><p>The DLMO protocol is used commonly in research studies but is not yet usually reimbursed for clinical purposes. It may eventually be used more routinely in clinical practice to aid in confirming diagnoses in challenging cases and to help identify optimal timing for interventions that aim to shift circadian phase (eg, exposure to bright light, exogenous melatonin administration). Methods have been tested to allow patients to perform the DLMO procedure at home, while attempting to preserve accuracy in the timing of saliva sample collections and adherence to other procedural elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2613393551\"><span class=\"h2\">Core body temperature measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the advent of melatonin profiling, core body temperature was the most commonly used method to assess circadian phase.</p><p>Core temperature is assessed by a rectal temperature sensor, or less commonly by an ingestible temperature sensing pill.

Depending on the disorder, useful approaches may include careful manipulations of bedtimes and rise times, appropriately timed melatonin, melatonin receptor agonists, and light therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders/abstract/16,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1509715457\" class=\"local\">'Functions of the circadian system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders arise either from presumed intrinsic abnormalities in the circadian system itself or from extrinsic factors (eg, shift work, air travel) that cause misalignment between the environmental light-dark cycle and an individual's internal circadian rhythm. (See <a href=\"#H2829469546\" class=\"local\">'Origins of circadian disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are recognized and defined by specific patterns of sleep-wake disruption resulting in insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness. These conditions can also have a negative impact on neurobehavioral performance, mental and physical health, and social and occupational functioning. (See <a href=\"#H477118688\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders are clinical diagnoses, made by history and review of sleep diaries or actigraphy. Melatonin sampling is not routinely used in clinical settings but may be useful in challenging cases. Polysomnography is only indicated when a comorbid sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H2156265576\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tools'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness are common symptoms with a myriad of potential etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811 \">table 5</a>). The key to suspecting an underlying circadian disorder is recognition of abnormal sleep-wake patterns, above and beyond the complaint of insomnia or daytime sleepiness.
