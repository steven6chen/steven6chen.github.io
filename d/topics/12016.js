One hypothesis is that occipital neuralgia results from injury to the C2-C3 nerve roots <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occipital nerves through different mechanisms (chronic instability, entrapment, trauma, inflammation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some have proposed vascular compression of the nerve by the occipital artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>The currently accepted view is that this disorder results from the chronic entrapment of the occipital nerves by the posterior neck and scalp muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. However, there is no compelling evidence to support the concept of irritation of the occipital nerves as the cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, there is no indisputable evidence from surgical studies to support entrapment of the occipital nerves as the etiology.</p><p>Most often, occipital neuralgia develops spontaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occipital neuralgia is thought by many nonspecialists to be common, but it is a relatively rare encounter in clinical practice among headache specialists. The literature on occipital neuralgia is conflicting, and the actual incidence and prevalence are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This situation reflects a lack of consensus regarding the definition and diagnostic criteria for occipital neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Quite often, the diagnosis is arbitrarily given to any pain in the occipital region.</p><p>Injuries such as whiplash during motor vehicle accidents may be a risk factor for occipital neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain of occipital neuralgia has a sudden onset. It is described as severe, stabbing, electric, shock-like, sharp, or shooting. It originates in the nuchal region and immediately spreads towards the vertex. The bouts of pain may start spontaneously or be provoked by specific maneuvers such as brushing the hair, exposing to cold, or moving the neck. The pain is usually unilateral, but bilateral cases occur as well. A dull occipital discomfort may be present during periods between the painful paroxysms.</p><p>On examination, pressure, palpation, or percussion over the occipital nerve trunks may reveal local tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], trigger painful paroxysms, worsen the background discomfort, or elicit paresthesias along the distribution of the affected nerve. Percussion of the nerve often reproduces the distribution of pain (Tinel's sign).</p><p>Cervical range of motion may be restricted and local posterior neck muscle spasms may be found.</p><p>Although somewhat contradictory to the strict definition of neuralgia, occipital neuralgia is sometimes accompanied by diminished sensation or dysesthesia in the affected area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The remainder of the neurologic exam is typically normal. An abnormal neurologic exam is an alert for potential alternative or underlying causes of the symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of occipital neuralgia is considered when typical clinical features are present; the diagnosis can be confirmed when pain is transiently relieved by a local occipital anesthetic block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, a local block is a nonspecific intervention, so symptomatic relief does not indicate a specific etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic criteria for occipital neuralgia from the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A) Unilateral or bilateral pain fulfilling criteria B through E</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B) Pain is located in the distribution of the greater, lesser <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> third occipital nerves</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C) Pain has two of the following three characteristics:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurring in paroxysmal attacks lasting from a few seconds to minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe intensity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shooting, stabbing, or sharp in quality</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D) Pain is associated with both of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allodynia apparent during innocuous stimulation of the scalp <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Either or both of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Tenderness over the affected nerve branches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Trigger points at the emergence of the greater occipital nerve or in the area of distribution of C2</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E) Pain is eased temporarily by local anesthetic block of the affected nerve</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F) Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p>The ICHD-3 classification requires distinguishing occipital neuralgia from occipital referral of pain from the atlantoaxial or upper zygapophyseal joints or from tender trigger points in neck muscles or their insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of cervical spine pain referred to the head is broad. Possible sources of such pain include structures innervated by the upper three cervical spinal nerves, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median atlantoaxial, atlanto-occipital, and lateral atlantoaxial joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C2-3 zygapophyseal joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suboccipital and upper posterior neck muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper prevertebral muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal and posterior cranial fossa dura mater</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebral arteries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C2-3 intervertebral disc</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles</p><p/><p>Thus, occipital neuralgia must be differentiated from referred occipital pain that originates in any of these structures. Multiple structural and infiltrative lesions have been identified as causes of occipital neuralgia, including meningioma, schwannoma, arteriovenous fistula, vascular compression, pyomyositis, multiple myeloma, and myelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/18-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-24</a>]. In most cases, the cause of occipital pain cannot be deduced on the basis of clinical features alone, thus warranting proper evaluation with neuroimaging. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Cervicogenic headache is thought to be caused by referred pain from the upper cervical joints, and is another consideration in the differential diagnosis. The pathophysiology, true source of pain, and even the existence of cervicogenic headache as a distinct clinical entity have been debated and remain somewhat controversial. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervicogenic-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervicogenic headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful evaluation of the upper cervical spine and posterior fossa is imperative for patients with suspected occipital neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There are no clear guidelines regarding the utility of neuroimaging studies for the evaluation of occipital neuralgia. However, because structural and infiltrative lesions may cause occipital neuralgia (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential'</a> above), we suggest obtaining MRI of the head and cervical spine for new cases of suspected occipital neuralgia, and we recommend imaging if the pain is atypical or if the neurologic examination is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The presence of continuous (rather than intermittent) occipital pain and the absence of impaired sensation suggest the pain is referred from some of the structures in the cervical region mentioned above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential'</a> above.)</p><p>Cervical medial branch blocks can provide the means to detect whether or not the neck pain is originating in one or more of the upper zygapophyseal joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative management with the application of local moist heat may alleviate muscle spasm and pain. Other patients might get some relief by applying cold locally one to three times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>However, a local occipital nerve block (usually a mixture of a local anesthetic plus a glucocorticoid) is usually the treatment of choice among practitioners experienced with this procedure, since it has the potential of being both diagnostic and therapeutic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>]. The nerve blocks should be performed by physicians, most often pain specialists, who are properly trained in the procedure.</p><p>Following occipital nerve block, pain relief is typically prompt and may last several weeks or even months. The procedure can be repeated when pain recurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. The procedure is generally safe, with few complications, as long as the <span class=\"nowrap\">anesthetic/glucocorticoid</span> injection is not inadvertently injected intravascularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Rarely, a patient may become cushingoid secondary to serial glucocorticoid-containing blocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>].</p><p>By definition and diagnostic criteria, the diagnosis is not occipital neuralgia if the pain does not resolve after occipital nerve block. Thus, other causes for the neuralgiform pain (such as cervicogenic headache) should be explored if occipital nerve block fails (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervicogenic-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervicogenic headache&quot;</a>). However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> may relieve the pain if it is paroxysmal in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25</a>]. Variable benefit has also been observed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and tricyclic antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the setting of acute occipital neuralgia secondary to traumatic cervical <span class=\"nowrap\">strain/sprain</span> injury, immobilization using a neck collar for two to three weeks may provide relief of painful paroxysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/8,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30</a>].</p><p>Occipital nerve stimulation has been employed in selected cases of severe occipital neuralgia unresponsive to less invasive measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occipital-neuralgia/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], but at present is not a routine therapeutic measure and should be reserved for use in a pain center with expertise in neuromodulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3169428935\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
