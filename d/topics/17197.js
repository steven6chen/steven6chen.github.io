Third nerve palsy may herald a life-threatening intracranial process (eg, tumor, aneurysm). The diagnosis and management of third nerve palsy varies according to the age of the patient, characteristics of the third nerve palsy, and the presence of associated signs and symptoms.</p><p>The manifestations and diagnosis of third nerve palsy will be reviewed here. Palsies of the fourth and sixth cranial nerves are considered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The third cranial nerve supplies the levator muscle of the eyelid and four extraocular muscles: the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique. The superior oblique muscle is innervated by cranial nerve IV and the lateral rectus muscle by cranial nerve VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72952 \">table 1</a>). In addition, the third cranial nerve constricts the pupil through its parasympathetic fibers that supply the smooth muscle of the ciliary body and the sphincter of the iris.</p><p>The third nerve begins as a nucleus in the midbrain. It consists of several subnuclei that innervate the individual extraocular muscles, the eyelids, and the pupils. Each subnucleus, except the superior rectus subnucleus, supplies the ipsilateral muscle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The superior rectus subnucleus innervates the contralateral superior rectus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The levator subnucleus is a single central caudate nucleus and innervates both eyelids.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The parasympathetic pupil nucleus (Edinger-Westphal nuclei) controls pupil constriction.</p><p/><p>The third nerve fascicle leaves the nucleus and passes ventrally near important structures in the midbrain (eg, red nucleus, corticospinal tract). It then enters the subarachnoid space, passes into the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, and finally divides into superior and inferior branches as it enters the superior orbital fissure in the orbit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76281\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76281 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acquired third nerve palsies usually complain of the sudden onset of binocular horizontal, vertical, or oblique diplopia and a droopy eyelid. Children with congenital third nerve palsies may not complain of diplopia because they ignore or suppress the second image or because they have superimposed amblyopia; often they are brought to medical attention by their parents, who have noticed ptosis or strabismus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of strabismus in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye examination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">General findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On physical examination, they may have a partial or complete ptosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59305\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59305 \">picture 1</a>). The pupil may be of normal size and normally reactive, dilated and poorly reactive, or dilated and non-reactive to light and near stimulus. Deficits in ipsilateral adduction (medial rectus), elevation (superior rectus, inferior oblique), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression (inferior rectus) may be present.</p><p>We consider third nerve palsies to be complete if impairment of the majority of function of all the somatic branches of the oculomotor nerve is present and ptosis is complete or almost complete.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the deficit of adduction is significant, a primary position exotropia (eye turned out) worse in gaze toward the paretic medial rectus muscle occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55347\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55347 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the elevator muscles (eg, superior rectus or inferior oblique muscles) are involved, an ipsilateral hypotropia (eye is turned down) occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59305\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59305 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the inferior rectus muscle is more involved, an ipsilateral hypertropia (eye is turned up) occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete third nerve palsies usually are associated with a large-angle exotropia and hypotropia (eye is down and out) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>].</p><p/><p>The remainder of the clinical presentation varies depending upon the location and type of lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Nuclear lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions of the third nerve nucleus are rare and usually are associated with other signs of mesencephalic (midbrain) involvement as described below. The levator palpebrae superioris muscles (which control the eyelids) are controlled by a single central subnucleus. Thus, in patients with nuclear lesions, they are affected either bilaterally or not at all. Nuclear lesions also can cause isolated muscle involvement of the extraocular muscles that are innervated by the third nerve.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most characteristic finding of a nuclear lesion is unilateral third nerve palsy with weakness of the ipsilateral and contralateral superior rectus (the superior rectus subnucleus is crossed) and bilateral incomplete ptosis (single central caudate subnucleus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral third nerve palsies with sparing of the eyelids (single levator subnucleus) and isolated bilateral ptosis with sparing of the extraocular muscles and pupils also can occur in nuclear lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nuclear third nerve palsies can be associated occasionally with ipsilateral ptosis and contralateral eyelid retraction (plus-minus lid syndrome) if supranuclear inhibitory input to the third nerve is disrupted and ptosis from a fascicular lesion on the contralateral side occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral or bilateral isolated medial rectus paralysis is unlikely to be caused by a nuclear lesion; medial rectus neurons probably lie at three different locations within the oculomotor nucleus. For this reason, patients with presumed isolated medial rectus paresis should be evaluated for internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) caused by damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internuclear-ophthalmoparesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internuclear ophthalmoparesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Nuclear lesions that are caused by infarction often are accompanied by lesions of the third nerve fascicle because both these structures are supplied by the paramedian branches of the basilar artery. Rarely does a fascicular third nerve lesion occur in isolation without other neurologic signs or symptoms. Nuclear and fascicular lesions are &quot;defined by the company they keep&quot;; the involvement of other midbrain structures identifies the midbrain location of the lesion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contralateral ataxia will be present if the red <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleus/superior</span> cerebellar peduncle is involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar tremor may be present in Claude syndrome (ipsilateral third nerve palsy and contralateral cerebellar signs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contralateral hemiparesis may be present in a cerebral peduncle lesion (Weber syndrome).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contralateral choreiform movements or tremor are present when red <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleus/substantia</span> nigra involvement occurs (Benedikt syndrome).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Extra-axial lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, extra-axial third nerve palsies usually are caused by ischemia. In contrast, ischemia is a rare cause for third nerve palsy in children; trauma and congenital third nerve palsies are more common.</p><p>Other extra-axial causes include uncal herniation; aneurysms of the internal carotid-posterior communicating, superior cerebellar, basilar, or posterior cerebral arteries; infection, inflammation, and neoplastic invasion of the meninges; and trauma (including neurosurgical procedures).</p><p>Ischemic lesions typically present with intact pupillary function, probably because of the lack of damage to the superficial periphery of the third nerve (where the majority of pupillomotor fibers are thought to pass) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. In contrast, aneurysmal compression of the superficial pupil fibers of the third nerve as it passes through the subarachnoid space usually results in a dilated and unresponsive pupil.

A population-based study in Minnesota identified 36 cases over a 15-year period; the age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence was 1.7 per 100,000 county residents under the age of 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Third nerve palsy in children often is congenital (intrauterine or birth-related events) but may occur after postnatal trauma, infection, inflammation, tumor, or childhood migraine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71965 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. Aneurysms are rare, but certain children are at increased risk (eg, those with polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Traumatic third nerve palsy usually arises only from severe blows to the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. Thus, third nerve palsy associated with mild head trauma should prompt evaluation for associated pathology. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One review at the Wilmer Eye Institute identified 41 children younger than eight years of age with third nerve palsy. The most frequent causes were congenital (39 percent), traumatic (37 percent), and neoplastic (17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 49 children with 53 affected eyes, the palsy was congenital in 20 eyes and caused by postnatal trauma in 17 eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and may be associated with absence of the superior division of the third cranial nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis can mimic any painless, pupil-spared, non-proptotic ophthalmoplegia and should be considered in every patient with a pupil-spared complete or incomplete third nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other signs of myasthenia gravis, such as ptosis, variability, and fatigue, usually are present. The &quot;ice test&quot; (a two-minute application of ice to the eyelid with ptosis) may help to differentiate myasthenia from other causes of ptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].

Historical features may help to distinguish congenital, traumatic, or infectious conditions. Inflammatory, neoplastic, and vascular conditions may be more insidious. Although aneurysms are rare in children, certain clinical features should increase suspicion for aneurysm:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of vasculopathic risk factors or alternative etiology (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, increased cholesterol).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe headache or other signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage (eg, loss of consciousness, seizure, nausea, vomiting, meningismus).

Lumbar puncture should be performed if signs or symptoms of meningeal inflammation or infection are present and in children who have pupillary involvement and negative radiologic evaluation. In addition, evaluation for myasthenia gravis and consultation with a neurologist, ophthalmologist, or neuro-ophthalmologist may be indicated.

These patients generally do not need angiography.</p><p>Neuroimaging may be deferred in adult patients who have ischemic third nerve palsies. In children, however, ischemia is an uncommon etiology for third nerve palsy, and neuroimaging is recommended.

Aneurysm is an extremely uncommon cause for a third nerve palsy in children. MR imaging and MR angiography or CTA probably are sufficient to exclude aneurysm in patients with low suspicion of intracranial aneurysm. As a general rule, these patients do not require catheter angiography unless they are at high risk for intracranial aneurysms (eg, polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Catheter angiography should be considered in all patients, including children, if the clinical findings are highly suggestive of aneurysm (eg, severe headache or other signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage) and the MR scan is normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Third nerve palsy with impaired pupillary function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third nerve palsies with complete pupilloparesis are often due to compressive lesions (eg, aneurysm) or meningeal inflammation. Aneurysm is an uncommon cause of third nerve palsy in children, but the diagnosis must be pursued in all children with otherwise unexplained pupillary involvement.</p><p>Some type of angiography (CTA versus catheter angiography) should still be considered in all patients with complete pupil involvement or other clinical evidence for aneurysm (eg, severe headache or other signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage). The risk of catheter angiography must be weighed against the risk of observation. At selected institutions, the use of CTA may be sufficient if the quality of the study and interpretation are adequate to exclude aneurysm and the clinical suspicion is low.</p><p>Children with these findings also should undergo neuroimaging, usually with MR. CT imaging may be preferred if there are signs or symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, because noncontrast CT scan is better able to detect hemorrhage. In addition, CT may be more readily available than MRI and can be combined with a CTA. MRI, however, is better for imaging the course of the third cranial nerve and for detecting non-aneurysmal etiologies for third nerve palsy. Consultation with a neuroradiologist may be helpful in determining the optimal imaging modalities and the order of imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">(CT/CTA</span> first versus <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRA</span> first) in children with a third nerve palsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-isolated third nerve palsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with non-isolated third nerve palsies should undergo neuroimaging (preferably MRI with contrast) with attention to the topographic areas suggested by the associated neurologic signs and symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy should be directed at the underlying etiology of the third nerve palsy.

However, this surgery is difficult to perform, particularly in children who have complete third nerve palsies, because multiple muscles are involved; ocular alignment may occur at the expense of more severe ophthalmoplegia. Ocular alignment can ultimately be achieved, but multiple procedures may be necessary, and binocular function often remains impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/10,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amblyopia therapy may be effective in maintaining visual function in children who have congenital disease.
