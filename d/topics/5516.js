However, these therapies are not a cure; they are only partially effective for reducing the relapse rate, and whether all or any reduce disability progression is still under investigation. However, some observational studies have found evidence suggesting that the use of DMTs for patients with MS is associated with a lower long-term risk of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>We recommend disease-modifying therapy (DMT) with one of the effective agents for all patients with RRMS starting as soon as possible. The choice of a specific agent should be individualized according to disease activity and patient values and preferences. Our suggested approach to initial treatment is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F102519\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102519 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infusion therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> for patients with more active disease and for those who value effectiveness above safety and convenience. The evidence that natalizumab is more effective than interferons, glatiramer, or oral DMTs for patients with RRMS is based upon cross-trial comparisons and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection therapy (interferons or glatiramer) for patients who value safety more than effectiveness and convenience.

We prefer dimethyl fumarate in this setting because it may be more effective and have a better safety profile than the other two agents, though the evidence is indirect and inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In addition, the potential teratogenicity of teriflunomide limits its use for a disease where a substantial portion of patients are of child-bearing age.</p><p/><p>Most DMTs are continued indefinitely in clinically stable patients with RRMS unless side effects are intolerable. Exceptions include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> therapy, where the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy increases with the duration of treatment, and pregnancy, where the risk of possible adverse effects of DMTs on the fetus must be weighed against DMT discontinuation and increased risk of maternal disease relapses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H835201149\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING RESPONSE TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The response to disease-modifying therapy can be monitored by clinical follow-up with careful attention to possible manifestations of MS disease activity including acute attacks (relapses) and onset or progression of sustained disability. Many or most experienced clinicians supplement the clinical information with periodic neuroimaging (MRI) studies to monitor the development of new asymptomatic lesions. Our preferred protocol is to assess patients with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57639 \">table 1</a>) every 3 months and a brain MRI every 12 months.</p><p>A range of symptomatic problems can occur in patients with MS. Cognitive dysfunction, depression, fatigue, and mood swings are increasingly common with disease progression. Paroxysmal symptoms, spasticity, tremor, seizures, sphincter dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction may also complicate disease progression. The management of these issues is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptom management of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute attacks of MS are typically treated with glucocorticoids. Indications for treatment of a relapse include functionally disabling symptoms with objective evidence of neurologic impairment. This is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no consensus about how often a patient with MS should undergo a brain MRI while stable on treatment. Since disease-modifying treatments are only partially effective, many MS experts recommend more aggressive treatment when acute or progressive disease activity is seen on MRI, even when the patient is on a specific treatment and appears to be doing well clinically. From this perspective, a reasonable approach is to repeat the brain MRI annually. More frequent neuroimaging may be desirable, but is impractical due to financial constraints. Less frequent imaging may be reasonable for individuals with years of clinically and radiologically stable disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H835201155\"><span class=\"h1\">REFRACTORY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with RRMS have disease activity that is refractory to initial disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Although refractory disease is hard to define, the frequency and severity of clinical relapses and MRI lesion activity on therapy are the crucial factors. A single relapse of mild severity or a single new MRI lesion within six months of starting DMT is concerning but is usually insufficient to demand a change in therapy. However, any serious relapse (ie, more than sensory involvement), multiple relapses regardless of severity, or a pronounced increase in MRI activity with multiple contrast-enhancing lesions should prompt a review of treatment options with a predisposition to change the DMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While there is no standard protocol for changing treatment in patients with either relapses or clinically silent MRI lesions, our suggested approach is outlined below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F102521\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102521 \">algorithm 2</a>). The overall goal is to balance the risks posed by the medications to the risks posed by the disease, though prognosticating long-term outcomes in MS is difficult.</p><p>For patients initially treated

The percentage of relapse-free patients, the primary outcome measure, was significantly decreased in the patients assigned to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a who developed neutralizing antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to concerns regarding neutralizing antibody formation, there were several criticisms of the EVIDENCE trial: the subjects were not blind to treatment assignment, the duration was relatively short (six months), disability was not used as an outcome measure, and different doses, frequencies, and routes of administration were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In an extension of the EVIDENCE trial, patients who changed from low-dose intramuscular interferon beta-1a (30 mcg once weekly injection) to high-dose subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (44 mcg three times weekly injection) experienced a statistically significant (50 percent) decrease in the annualized relapse rate, while patients continuing on high-dose interferon beta-1a experienced a nonsignificant (26 percent) decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Peginterferon beta-1a was evaluated in the ADVANCE trial, which randomly assigned 1512 adults with RRMS in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with subcutaneous peginterferon 125 mcg once every two weeks, peginterferon 125 mcg once every four weeks, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At 48 weeks, the annualized relapse rates for the peginterferon every two-week group, the every four-week group, and placebo group were 0.256, 0.288, and 0.397, respectively. The corresponding relative risk reduction for the group receiving pegylated interferon every two weeks versus the placebo group was 0.64 (95% CI 0.50-0.83), while the absolute risk reduction was 0.14. Peginterferon treatment also led to statistically significant improvements on a number of other outcome measures, including a slight reduction in sustained disability progression and a reduction in several MRI measures of brain lesion activity. The preparation was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, influenza-like illness, and headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These results suggest that peginterferon beta-1a is effective for the treatment of RRMS. Because it requires fewer injections, peginterferon beta-1a may be better tolerated than nonpegylated interferon beta formulations. However there are no data directly comparing pegylated with non-pegylated formulations, and longer-term studies are needed to confirm the benefit and safety of peginterferon beyond the first year.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term benefit of interferons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefit of long-term treatment with IFNB preparations for RRMS remains unproven. As reviewed above, randomized controlled trials of these agents provide evidence of benefit only for the relatively short duration (generally two years) of the trials. Results from a number of clinical trial extension studies suggest that there is continued benefit of IFNB treatment beyond two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/12,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,25,26</a>].

However, serious hepatotoxicity associated with IFNB is rare.

It is unclear whether monitoring these laboratory studies is helpful for detecting and avoiding the rare cases of serious IFNB-related toxicity. We suggest checking liver function tests monthly for six months after initiating therapy. We also suggest decreasing the IFNB dose by 50 percent if leukopenia develops or if transaminases are persistently elevated (three to five times normal) in the absence of another identifiable cause (eg, illness, a new medication, or alcohol intake).

The effectiveness of oral laquinimod was evaluated in two large randomized controlled trials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the multicenter ALLEGRO trial, 1106 patients with RRMS were randomly assigned to oral laquinimod (0.6 mg daily) or to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. At 24 months, oral laquinimod treatment led to a statistically significant though modest reductions in the annual relapse rate (0.30, versus 0.39 for placebo; risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91) and in the risk of confirmed disability progression (11.1 versus 15.7 percent, hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.91). Laquinimod was generally well-tolerated, but transient reversible liver enzyme elevations were twofold more frequent in the laquinimod group. The trial had a relatively high dropout rate (22 percent), which limits the strength of the findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The multicenter BRAVO trial enrolled 1331 patients with RRMS and randomly assigned them to either laquinimod (0.6 mg daily), intramuscular interferon beta-1a (30 mcg weekly), or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. Preliminary findings show that laquinimod treatment at 24 months resulted in a trend towards a reduction in the annualized relapse rate that missed statistical significance in the unadjusted analysis (0.28, versus 0.34 with placebo, risk ratio [RR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.66-1.02). In contrast, the reduction in annualized relapse rate with interferon beta-1a treatment compared with placebo was significant. However, in a post hoc analysis that adjusted for baseline imbalances on brain MRI T2 lesion volume and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, laquinimod treatment led to a statistically significant reduction in annualized relapse rate. The trial was not designed to compare laquinimod with interferon beta-1a.</p><p/><p>These trials suggest that laquinimod is modestly effective for reducing the relapse rate and disability progression for patients with RRMS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254857331\"><span class=\"h2\">Rituximab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes that causes B cell reduction.

The process involves mobilizing and harvesting hematopoietic stem cells from the patient&rsquo;s peripheral blood or bone marrow, followed by a conditioning regimen of chemotherapy, sometimes with immune-depleting biologic agents or radiation therapy, to partially or totally ablate the patient&rsquo;s immune system. The last step is infusing the harvested stem cells to regenerate the immune system.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series of 156 adults with MS, mainly RRMS (n = 123), treatment with nonmyeloablative HSCT was associated with improvement in disability and other clinical outcomes at two years and four years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>].
