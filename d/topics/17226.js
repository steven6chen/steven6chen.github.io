This topic review will cover the epidemiology, pathology, classification, clinical presentation, staging, and treatment of NETs arising in the thymus. Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are addressed separately, as are the diagnostic evaluation of patients with a mediastinal mass and the differential diagnosis of an anterior mediastinal mass.

The gland is composed of a central medulla and an outer cortex, surrounded by an outer capsule. The thymus consists primarily of epithelial cells, keratinized epithelial cells (Hassall corpuscles), myoid cells, thymic lymphocytes (&quot;thymocytes&quot;), and B-lymphocytes, which may rarely form germinal centers. The thymus is primarily involved in the processing and maturation of lymphocytes, which become T-lymphocytes upon release into the circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development#H1231136\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;, section on 'T cell development'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4769298\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thymic malignancies as a group are relatively rare (0.2 to 1.5 percent of all malignancies, 0.13 cases per 100,000 population in the United States), but they are among the most common mediastinal primary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Of the primary thymic malignancies, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are the least common, accounting for 2 to 5 percent of thymic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A thymic primary site accounts for approximately 0.4 percent of all carcinoid tumors; this corresponds to an estimated annual incidence in the United States of approximately 0.2 per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of mediastinal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Almost all cases have been reported in adults, with a median age of approximately 54 years and a strong male preponderance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/4,5,7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7-11</a>]. The largest reported series of thymic NETs consists of 160 patients who were reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database over a 33-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The median age at presentation was 57, and the male to female ratio was 3:1. Disease was confined to the thymus, locally invasive (or involving regional lymph nodes), or distantly metastatic in 27, 36, and 28 percent of cases, respectively. Histologically, tumors were classified as well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated, or <span class=\"nowrap\">poorly-differentiated/anaplastic</span> in 58, 10, and 12 percent of cases, respectively.</p><p>Up to 25 percent of thymic NETs arise in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a genetic disorder that predisposes to the development of multiple endocrine and non-endocrine proliferations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Among MEN1 patients, thymic NETs develop in approximately 3 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], although the prevalence is probably underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thymic carcinoids appear to be a relatively late manifestation of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Carcinoid tumors'</a>.)</p><p>The vast majority of reported cases of MEN1-associated thymic NETs have occurred in men (a surprising fact given the autosomal dominant nature of the inheritance pattern), and virtually all were heavy smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], suggesting that tobacco exposure may represent a risk factor. The association between cigarette smoke and sporadic thymic carcinoids is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4769305\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening in MEN1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thymic NETs, while rare, represent a neoplasm with greater malignant potential than other MEN1-associated tumors, and therefore are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in MEN1 kindreds. Some experts have recommended that male MEN1 patients over the age of 25 undergo screening with annual chest radiograph and chest computed tomography (CT) every three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], but there is no consensus on this issue. Others recommend annual chest CT in all patients with MEN1 who are over the age of 25, particularly men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The benefits of screening are debated, given that no study has shown that early diagnosis through screening improves prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H14907078\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening for MEN1-associated tumors'</a> and <a href=\"#H37710672\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and management'</a> below.)</p><p>Prophylactic cervical thymectomy should be considered in patients with MEN1 to address the risk of supernumerary parathyroids in the thymus, particularly if all four parathyroid glands have not yet been discovered and managed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,17</a>]. Its effectiveness in reducing the risk of a thymic NET is unproven, however, and studies have shown the occurrence of a thymic NET in a patient with MEN1 despite a prophylactic transcervical thymectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/13,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,18</a>]. If prophylactic thymectomy is performed, it is imperative that complete resection of all anterior mediastinal tissue that can potentially contain thymic tissue be removed.</p><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Surgical approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703971797\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Until 1972, all epithelial tumors of the thymus were referred to as &quot;epithelial thymomas.&quot; In 1972, Rosai and Higa reported eight cases of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the thymus and coined the term &quot;thymic carcinoid&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other tumors'</a>.)</p><p>The most recent 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) classification for thymic neoplasms is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53024 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. NETs arising in the thymus are broadly categorized as low-grade (typical carcinoid), intermediate-grade (atypical carcinoid), or high-grade (large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, small cell carcinoma) tumors.</p><p>The histologic diagnosis of a thymic carcinoid is based upon the presence of neuroendocrine features such as organoid nests, trabeculae, rosettes, or palisading and homogeneous cytologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59363%7EPULM%2F61672\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59363 graphicRef61672 \">picture 1A-B</a>). The cells are relatively uniform, and they have round to oval nuclei, coarsely stippled chromatin, and finely granular cytoplasm. The cells produce abundant neurosecretory granules, as reflected in the strong and diffuse immunohistochemical expression of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin.</p><p>The criteria used to separate typical from atypical carcinoid are the same as those applied in the classification of pulmonary NETs. However, the prognostic value of this classification for thymic lesions has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H4047701511\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>Typical carcinoids show no necrosis and have less than 2 mitoses per 2 mm<sup>2</sup>, while atypical carcinoids have areas of necrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 2 to 10 mitoses per 2 mm<sup>2</sup>. Among reported cases of thymic NETs, almost all are classified as atypical carcinoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>There are several histologic variants of thymic carcinoids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53024 \">table 1</a>). While their clinical behavior is similar to that of other thymic carcinoids, their unusual morphology may present diagnostic problems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The spindle cell pattern of thymic NET can be mistaken for spindle cell thymoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54346\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54346 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The distinction can be readily established utilizing neuroendocrine immunohistochemical markers. Pigmented thymic NETs contain intracytoplasmic melanin and should be distinguished from a melanoma. Positive staining for neuroendocrine markers and negative studies for S-100 protein and HMB-45 exclude melanoma from consideration. Thymic NET with amyloid is a spindle cell neoplasm with amyloid stroma and positivity for calcitonin, which is thought to derive from extrathyroid C cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC) are composed of large atypical cells with extensive areas of necrosis, often located centrally within tumor cell nests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. They show cytologic features of a non-small cell carcinoma, with coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli in the majority of cells, with more than 10 mitoses per 2 mm<sup>2</sup>.<sup> </sup>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H4047701511\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>Small cell carcinomas are comprised of small blue cells with minimal cytoplasm, similar to their counterpart in the lung. Like LCNEC of the thymus, they also typically have a high mitotic rate (often greater than 60 per 10 high-powered fields).

However, while neuroendocrine markers can be present in thymomas and thymic carcinomas, in contrast to NETs, they usually lack neuroendocrine morphology and show more focal staining of neuroendocrine markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of mediastinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Thymoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraganglioma is an unusual tumor in the mediastinum that can be misdiagnosed as an NET. Histologically, paraganglioma demonstrates an organoid nesting pattern (Zellballen) with prominent vascularity. Unlike a thymic NET, however, it has a striking variation in cellular and nuclear size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. By immunohistochemistry, paragangliomas are typically positive for neuroendocrine markers and often positive for GATA-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], while negative for pancytokeratin and TTF-1. In contrast, thymic carcinoid tumors are positive for pancytokeratins and sometimes TTF-1, but not GATA-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Ectopic parathyroid glands may be found within the thymus, due to the common origin of the thymus and the inferior parathyroid glands from the third branchial pouch. Histologically, parathyroid adenomas are composed of sheets, nests, trabeculae, and tubules made of chief cells, water-clear cells, and oncocytic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], the latter of which can be present in some carcinoid tumors.

Exclusion of lymphoma and germ cell tumor is important since these two conditions may be treated medically rather than surgically. For small, seemingly encapsulated masses where surgical resection appears feasible, thymectomy should be performed, with en bloc resection of adjacent tissues based on local stage of disease. For larger masses, a surgical biopsy may be indicated.</p><p>If the diagnosis of a thymic neuroendocrine tumor is established on biopsy, we complete the evaluation with cross sectional imaging of the abdomen and baseline somatostatin receptor imaging using either indium-111 pentetreotide (OctreoScan) or, where available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H851153\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-sectional imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cross-sectional imaging is indicated whenever a mediastinal mass is detected on a chest radiograph. A chest CT scan, preferably with intravenous water-soluble contrast material, refines lesion localization, allows further characterization of the morphologic features of the mass, and allows the evaluation of adjacent thoracic structures for evidence of local invasion or regional metastases. In some cases, the findings are sufficiently characteristic for specific histologies (eg, a teratoma).</p><p>A thymic carcinoid typically manifests as a large, lobulated, usually invasive, anterior mediastinal mass with heterogeneous enhancement that may exhibit areas of hemorrhage and necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75493\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75493 \">image 1</a>). Punctate and dystrophic calcifications may also be seen. There are no pathognomonic findings, and it may be difficult to distinguish a thymic NET from other thymic malignancies or from nonthymic malignancies such as lymphoma or metastatic disease on the basis of radiographic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. In general, the presence of extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy in association with a dominant mediastinal mass suggests a thymic carcinoma or carcinoid (or lymphoma or metastatic disease) rather than a thymoma.</p><p>In general, CT is the imaging procedure of choice for anterior mediastinal masses. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in particular a cardiac MRI, can be very helpful in assessing invasion of the pericardium, proximal great vessels, or heart structures in cases of large masses that are causing at least displacement of these structures due to mass effect.

Somatostatin-receptor-based diagnostic imaging using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, such as indium-111 (111-In) pentetreotide scanning (OctreoScan) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> PET scanning, can be used to identify these tumors, distinguish them from other malignancies arising in the anterior mediastinal compartment, and exclude a primary NET in another site that may have metastasized to the thymus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. One benefit of radiolabeled somatostatin analog imaging over cross-sectional imaging modalities is that it can image the whole body and identify metastatic disease, particularly outside the thorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Among patients with an anterior mediastinal mass, exclusion of lymphoma and a mediastinal germ cell tumor is important since these two conditions would be treated medically rather than surgically. A small, seemingly encapsulated mass should ideally be resected along with the thymus gland to establish the diagnosis and effect therapy, whereas a larger mass with indistinct margins should be biopsied before proceeding with resection to establish the diagnosis and provide for decision-making about neoadjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Although CT-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy via a parasternal approach can allow preoperative identification of a thymic carcinoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/31,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,59-61</a>], it may not be possible to secure a definitive diagnosis. There may not be sufficient tumor cells in the cell block to perform immunohistochemistry for neuroendocrine markers or flow cytometry, which can help establish a diagnosis of lymphoma. Furthermore, it may not be possible to distinguish among the grades of thymic carcinoid by cytologic study since two of the most important morphologic criteria for the distinction (mitotic counts and necrosis) may not be evident in small biopsy sample or cytologic preparations. Endoscopic or transbronchial ultrasound-guided FNA may be valuable in select cases, for example when metastatic cancer to mediastinal lymph nodes is suspected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63771 \">figure 2</a>). Cervical mediastinoscopy is another excellent approach to biopsying mediastinal lymph nodes not accessible by less invasive endoscopic techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-ultrasound-indications-contraindications-and-complications#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial ultrasound: Indications, contraindications, and complications&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.) </p><p>If this procedure does not establish a diagnosis, then a surgical biopsy may be indicated. The approach depends upon the location of the tumor and the expertise of the surgeon. If the mass abuts the anterior chest wall then a direct cutdown, an anterior mediastinotomy (Chamberlain procedure), may be the simplest approach. In cases where the mass protrudes into either side of the chest, the lesion can be approached with a video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) approach. VATS can often be performed with a single one centimeter incision that both provides access to the mass for a biopsy and also allows <span class=\"nowrap\">inspection/biopsy</span> of the pleural space. This approach may be ideal if there is suspicion of lung metastases that have defied other diagnostic attempts. A disadvantage to a VATS approach is that a postoperative chest tube and at least a one night hospital admission may be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23027665\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single formal staging classification for thymic NETs has not been available, and therefore, the terms &quot;local,&quot; &quot;locally advanced&quot; (or locoregional), and &quot;metastatic&quot; are commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

A high degree of suspicion in families with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), and earlier detection of thymic NETs may improve outcomes, although this has not yet been borne out in clinical studies. As an example, in one report, 85 patients with MEN1 were prospectively evaluated over a mean of eight years with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest radiograph, and indium-111 (111-In) pentetreotide scanning (OctreoScan) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Seven patients were diagnosed with a thymic NET, and all underwent resection. Despite the presumably early diagnosis, all patients followed for longer than one year recurred. With the exception of male gender, no clinical, laboratory, or other feature of the MEN1 patients distinguished those who developed a NET from those who did not. The issue of screening for thymic carcinoids in patients with MEN1 is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H14907078\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening for MEN1-associated tumors'</a>.)</p><p>In other patients, the natural history can often be prolonged, with a tendency to recur and metastasize over many years (as many as 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]) after the initial operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/9,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,68,69</a>].

The thymus receives its arterial blood supply from poorly defined branches of the internal mammary, superior thyroid, and inferior thyroid arteries. Venous drainage is via better defined branches of the innominate vein. Anatomically, the thymus is located in both the cervical region and in the mediastinum, consisting of bilateral cervical horns and extending into the chest down to the diaphragm anterior to the pericardium. Complete surgical resection of all thymic tissue is generally felt to require resection of all mediastinal tissue anterior to pericardium from the cervical horns in the neck down to the diaphragm, and laterally to each phrenic nerve. Resection should include hilar and mediastinal lymph node sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Completeness of resection is a strong prognostic factor for overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/5,8,28,31,32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,28,31,32,36</a>]. Whenever possible, complete surgical resection (of the primary tumor and regional nodes) is the treatment of choice. Unfortunately, microscopically complete resections are uncommonly achieved with tumors that invade contiguous mediastinal structures such as major blood vessels, pericardium, or phrenic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Furthermore, even after complete surgical resection, there is a high rate of local recurrence.</p><p>Thymectomy and resection of anterior mediastinal masses can be achieved via several different techniques, which are generally chosen based on thymus size and location. Minimally invasive approaches may be appropriate for masses less than 4 to 5 cm in size, and can be performed through the neck (transcervical thymectomy) or through the chest (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [VATS] or robotic thymectomy). In general, most of these tumors are diagnosed at a size that is not amenable to minimally invasive techniques. Tumors that extend into one side of the chest may require a hemi-clamshell incision, while tumors that extend into both sides of the chest may require a thoracosternotomy (clamshell incision). In some cases, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass available may facilitate safe exploration and resection in cases where cardiac or great vessel invasion cannot be ruled out before surgery by cardiac MRI. (See <a href=\"#H851153\" class=\"local\">'Cross-sectional imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>It is unclear whether surgical debulking of large tumors without curative intent confers any survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. However, palliative surgical resection or debulking of a large primary tumor causing compression symptoms may provide benefits in terms of symptom control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thymic-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Proceeding with a major operation with palliative intent should only be undertaken in highly selected cases, and ideally the decision made in with multidisciplinary team input. Palliative resection could also be considered if a hormonal secretory condition such as Cushing's syndrome, hypercalcemia, or carcinoid syndrome is debilitating. Patients with refractory Cushing's syndrome may need end-organ ablation (ie, bilateral adrenalectomy).

Even in those tumors, there is no real basis for choosing <sup>177</sup>Lu-dotatate over everolimus, or vice versa, as the second-line treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas should be treated similarly to small cell carcinoma of the lung, with combined platinum plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, as should poorly differentiated high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas arising at other extrapulmonary sites.

After five years, imaging frequency can be decreased if there is no evidence of recurrence. Because histology cannot reliably predict prognosis after resection, long-term surveillance (up to 10 years) is recommended with scans at least annually.
