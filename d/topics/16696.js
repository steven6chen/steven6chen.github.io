In fact, swallowing disorders, distinct from diminished appetite, are part of the natural process at the end of life, irrespective of the etiology. Swallowing disorders occur frequently in patients with malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract and brain as well as with progressive degenerative neurologic disorders, including dementia. But they can occur as a result of the general debility that develops in patients with a variety of medical illnesses who are near the end of life. Swallowing disorders are a major predisposing condition for aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia and can contribute to malnutrition, dehydration, and in some cases, death. Difficulty swallowing can impact the quality of life of the patient as well as of caregivers, whose natural instinct to nurture and comfort with food is curtailed. For many patients with a life-limiting illness, the inability to swallow may represent a pivotal symptom that prompts the decision to consider end of life or hospice care. </p><p>The consequences of aspiration can vary widely, from no injury at all to pneumonia or asphyxiation due to airway obstruction. Sometimes the impact is immediate, as occurs with asphyxiation, or it may develop slowly, depending on the volume and chemical composition of the aspirated material. Most importantly, the effectiveness of the patient&rsquo;s pulmonary defenses and airway clearance mechanism can predict the implications of aspiration of food or liquid into the airway. Providers, patients, family, and caregivers would be well served in recognizing the signs of dysphagia, securing airway protection, and determining appropriate ways to provide nutrition and hydration and to administer medications.</p><p>Management of swallowing disorders is challenging, and the risk for aspiration may persist even with therapeutic intervention. Adherence to recommendations for safe swallowing is difficult. Patients may not choose to change their diet consistency, and serious illness may impact their vigilance and attention to treatment plans. Given these multiple variables, it is daunting for providers to quantify the true implication of aspiration, even if swallowing is only somewhat impaired.</p><p>This topic review will cover the assessment and management of swallowing disorders in patients with life-limiting illness. A review of normal and disordered swallowing and a description of types of swallowing disorders are presented elsewhere, as are reviews of speech and swallowing rehabilitation for patients treated for head and neck cancer, aspiration pneumonia in adults, and aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in children. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Definition, consequences, pathophysiology, and etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=speech-and-swallowing-rehabilitation-of-the-patient-with-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Speech and swallowing rehabilitation of the patient with head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1880341\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SUSPECT A SWALLOWING DISORDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific clinical features, disease states, patient characteristics, and medical interventions that can predict an increased risk of swallowing dysfunction are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F116401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116401 \">table 1</a>). Recognizing factors that are clinically associated with or cause a swallowing impairment can guide referral for appropriate assessment and management. </p><p>Detection of a swallowing disorder may elude the attention of both patients and caregivers. Silent aspiration (where food enters the upper airway without overt signs of coughing or choking) is a common correlate of dysphagia. In fact, 40 percent of patients who aspirate are said to aspirate silently, and this is more likely in individuals with a serious life-limiting illness where multiple causative factors coexist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinicians should be alert for surrogate markers of dysphagia, such as unexplained fever or cough with chills; alterations in secretion volume, color, or viscosity; chest pain; or dyspnea. Weight loss and poor appetite are predictable at the end of life, but when they coexist with respiratory findings and signs of struggling during eating, a swallowing disorder may be the possible cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179304435\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are expert in assessment and management of oropharyngeal swallowing disorders across the continuum of care. The goals of a clinical swallowing assessment are to identify the pathophysiology of the disorder and to determine relevant interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The assessment must be framed by an understanding of the overall health status of the patient in conjunction with the patient and caregiver&rsquo;s wishes and preferences, particularly in relation to nutrition and hydration. As such, the evaluation reaches beyond the physiology of deglutition. Together with the multidisciplinary team caring for patients with advanced life-threatening illness, the SLP must carefully weigh which swallowing interventions might benefit the patient against those that will be excessively burdensome.</p><p>The following palliative care principles should be considered: prevention and relief of suffering and an emphasis on ensuring comfort; the care plan should reflect the prognosis of the underlying life-threatening disease, be consistent with the overall goals of treatment, and be adjusted as the disease evolves; care is optimized by the involvement of an interdisciplinary team whereby each specialist contributes <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> expert knowledge; and the patient and family are the unit of care and their wishes and preferences should guide collaborative decision making.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179304447\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed clinical history is invaluable in framing the nature of the swallowing problem and establishing the diagnosis. Eliciting a description of the patient&rsquo;s complaints about swallowing helps to point to the physiologic basis of the problem. Frequently encountered patient complaints regarding swallowing and their potential physiologic counterparts are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F95389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95389 \">table 2</a>). As an example, the swallowing history may suggest a mechanical obstruction from tumor burden or stricture, or an underlying neuromuscular weakness. Asking the patient, or caregiver in persons with cognitive impairment, which foods are easier to swallow and which are avoided, with special focus on liquids versus solids, may provide clues about the location of the disorder. Patients who complain of dysphagia with solid food and who localize the area of difficulty to the throat may have either esophageal or pharyngeal dysphagia, and thus, both locations must be investigated. However, those who point to the chest are usually more accurate in localizing the problem to the esophagus. Alterations in eating behaviors, the severity and specific nature of the complaints, the details of disease progression, and prior treatment can provide clues to factors that might predispose the patient to silent aspiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Definition, consequences, pathophysiology, and etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Information about the patient&rsquo;s current eating habits should be obtained. Can the patient feed him- or herself? How have meal times changed since the illness? What is the total calorie intake the patient receives on a daily basis, and how far short does this fall from nutritional requirements? Length of meal time and effort required are indicators of eating efficiency. Additional areas of inquiry include factors that alleviate or exacerbate the problem, such as body position and time of day, the ability to swallow medication, and the presence of pain on swallowing. Potential indicators of a swallowing disorder, based upon the clinical history and direct observation, are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F95389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95389 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12413142\" class=\"local\">'Direct observation of swallowing function'</a> below.) </p><p>Understanding the emotional and psychologic impact of the swallowing disorder on the patient and family is as important as ascertaining the physiologic correlates of the problem and provides a helpful framework for determining the next steps in the workup and management of the problem. A patient with a poor appetite, fatigue, and a sense of hopelessness may be less motivated to engage in a complex diagnostic and treatment program. Alternatively, a patient who derives much satisfaction from eating and drinking and wishes to continue with a regular diet will not be satisfied with significant alterations in food texture, smell, and consistency. There are often competing benefits and risks regarding swallowing function and nutrition, and attention to the patient&rsquo;s preferences is paramount in providing appropriate psychosocial support. Sometimes there is an imbalance between the patient and caregivers&rsquo; goals around nutrition, a dynamic that should be factored in when decisions are being considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12412662\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the examination is to expose the factors responsible for the dysphagia and to predict the effectiveness of treatment strategies. Many times, the physical examination findings are nonspecific, and a more focused instrumental evaluation involving imaging may be more revealing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12412939\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of oral hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The status of the oral mucosa and general oral hygiene reflect the patient&rsquo;s ability to manage secretions, patient comfort, and ease of swallowing solid boluses. Oral health is often compromised in those who are seriously ill, and oral hygiene may be neglected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Overview of mouth care at the end of life&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Saliva is essential for the maintenance of oral health as it neutralizes acid, which promotes caries. It contains specific agents that decrease intraoral bacteria through dilution and microbicidal enzymes. Salivary mucins limit intraoral trauma by lubricating the hard and soft tissues, and they aid swallowing by facilitating bolus formation. Aspiration of colonized bacteria can introduce inoculum into the lower airways that may be difficult to clear. Thus, the status of the oral mucosa and overall oral hygiene can provide prognostic clues regarding the impact of aspiration if it occurs. </p><p>Severe illness and polypharmacy may alter the normal oral environment, salivary production, and growth of oral bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Persistent dry mouth (xerostomia) is also a strong predictor of patient comfort. Xerostomia may cause, contribute to, or exacerbate dysphagia. Xerostomia is a frequent complication of radiation therapy to the head and neck region, polypharmacy, and the use of supplemental oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment#H3822348\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;, section on 'Salivary gland damage and xerostomia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Salivary gland damage and xerostomia'</a>.) </p><p>It is not uncommon to find dry secretions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrush crusted along the tongue, palate, and pharynx in patients who have not eaten orally in some time. Dental caries and dentures that are not well cared for can also contribute to poor oral hygiene. Dried oral secretions may also loosen during trials of oral food or fluids and inadvertently obstruct the airway. Before giving the patient food or liquids, even for assessment purposes, the oral cavity should be carefully cleared of extraneous secretions using mouth swabs, tongue scrapers, toothbrushes, and oral suction, if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549572322\"><span class=\"h2\">Cranial nerve examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings from the examination of cranial nerve (CN) function pertinent to swallowing (CN V, VII, IX, X, and XII) help predict how swallowing function may be affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F96249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96249 \">table 3</a>). Motor responses are evaluated for symmetry, speed, strength, accuracy, and range of movement. For example, unilateral tongue weakness may affect formation of a solid bolus, a facial palsy may cause drooling, and a weak cough may be associated with aspiration. Sensory input is also a key contributor to swallowing integrity and can influence the force of mastication, the timing of the pharyngeal swallow response, and the intensity of the pharyngeal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> esophageal motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12413142\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct observation of swallowing function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct observation of the patient while eating, drinking, or taking medications by a perceptive clinician can yield valuable information regarding not only the likelihood of aspiration but also the efficiency of swallowing function. Additional indicators of a potential swallowing disorder, derived from the initial clinical examination, are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F116401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116401 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H179304435\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p>Special attention is paid to airway protection, especially the effectiveness of the glottic cough, both volitional (to command) and reflexive (as seen in choking). Effective airway protection is a critical predictor of safe swallowing and entails timely and complete laryngeal closure during swallowing, with a strong cough at the glottis and pharyngeal expectoration in response to aspiration. Patients with a weak voice <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> expiratory strength for coughing are at a higher risk for not clearing food or liquid that they may aspirate. A delayed cough, even if it is strong, may lead to impaired airway protection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology#H105652909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Definition, consequences, pathophysiology, and etiology&quot;, section on 'Normal swallowing'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who do not respond to aspiration with a cough or throat clear are &ldquo;silent aspirators,&rdquo; a phenomenon that cannot be definitively discerned from the clinical evaluation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Occult signs of aspiration include a wet vocal quality or gurgling; other <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> include frequent throat clearing, delayed coughing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral or pharyngeal residue after a swallow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1880341\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect a swallowing disorder'</a> above.)</p><p>&ldquo;Silent&rdquo; aspiration can only be confirmed definitively with an instrumental examination, such as videofluoroscopy, or laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p>Other behaviors observed in a clinical or bedside swallowing evaluation include patient behaviors with respect to efficiency of chewing and swallowing that can help predict the likelihood of meaningful oral nutrition. Protracted chewing, inattention, holding food for prolonged periods, drooling, and regurgitation affect swallowing efficiency. In addition, some patients take a few bites and then stop eating, and others prefer only drinking fluids. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12413412\"><span class=\"h2\">Instrumental evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the clinical swallowing evaluation reveals concerning but indeterminate findings, and further investigation aligns with the patient&rsquo;s clinical status, goals, and preferences, videofluoroscopic or endoscopic evaluation of swallowing can provide valuable diagnostic information and suggestions for management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H179304507\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic swallowing strategies'</a> below.)</p><p>It should be emphasized that each of these examinations involves moving the patient and some degree of discomfort. Sometimes pain, difficulty positioning, and wakefulness preclude an instrumental examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179304489\"><span class=\"h3\">Videofluoroscopic swallowing study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (also known as modified <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow study) is a noninvasive radiographic procedure that examines the oral, pharyngeal, and cervical esophageal stages of swallowing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99531%7ERADIOL%2F99530\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99531 graphicRef99530 \">image 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. SLPs perform these studies in collaboration with radiologists. A digital video recording is made and can be replayed at slow speeds to facilitate accurate analysis.</p><p>The patient is usually seated upright and swallows a variety of consistencies of barium-coated foods (liquids, semisolids, and solids). Videofluoroscopy identifies the pathophysiology of the swallowing disorder, including the biomechanical reasons for aspiration and the patient&rsquo;s protective response. Based upon an understanding of the cause of the dysphagia, the clinician can directly evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that may decrease the risk of aspiration and increase swallowing efficiency. (See <a href=\"#H179304507\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic swallowing strategies'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540858749\"><span class=\"h3\">Barium swallow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to videofluoroscopic swallowing study, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow study is conducted by a radiologist with the patient positioned upright and prone. Barium swallow study examines esophageal function fluoroscopically and concentrates on the anatomy of the esophagus and passage of a food or liquid bolus into the stomach. It can identify mucosal and anatomical abnormalities, identify esophageal strictures, and assess esophageal motility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;, section on 'Esophageal manometry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Manometry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults#H4287910141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;, section on 'Ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179304495\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic examination of oropharyngeal swallowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES) is performed by an SLP specially trained in the procedure. The oropharynx and larynx are visualized transnasally with a laryngoscope while the patient swallows food and liquid dyed with food coloring for contrast. Laryngeal penetration (contrast in the laryngeal vestibule), aspiration (contrast below the vocal folds), and pharyngeal retention post-swallow can be observed. An FEES can provide important information for determining reduced swallow safety and efficiency. As with videofluoroscopic swallowing study, therapeutic strategies, such as postural modifications or swallowing maneuvers, can be evaluated for their efficacy during FEES. (See <a href=\"#H179304507\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic swallowing strategies'</a> below.)</p><p>Videofluoroscopic swallowing study and FEES are complementary procedures, although both can evaluate physiologic impairments of oropharyngeal swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study permits evaluation of the entire oropharyngeal swallow (from the lips to the gastroesophageal junction). This procedure does not reveal details about mucosal changes in the pharynx or larynx. FEES provides information about mucosal integrity and laryngeal function, such as vocal fold adduction and secretion management, but its view excludes the nature of the oral or esophageal stage dysfunction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2374651218\"><span class=\"h3\">Esophagogastroduodenoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), an endoscopic evaluation of the esophagus, stomach, and upper small intestine, is completed by a gastroenterologist while the patient is sedated. EGD can confirm the presence of strictures and mucosal anomalies. Management of strictures with an esophageal stent, laser ablation of an intraluminal tumor, or dilatation can be accomplished during this procedure, if indicated.

Efficient and safe swallowing are both important criteria for continued oral nutrition. Guided by the swallowing assessment, comprehensive dysphagia management may use a variety of approaches simultaneously, including alterations in food and liquid consistency, use of alternative routes for nutrition and hydration, direct swallowing therapy, and use of other medical interventions. Treatment goals are individualized to the patient and aim to improve swallowing function, maximize residual swallowing ability, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintain some oral intake for pleasure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3852971771\"><span class=\"h2\">Shared decision making</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient autonomy and shared decision making are critical ethical principles; however, a patient&rsquo;s choice to continue with oral nutrition must be accompanied by a clear understanding of the possible risks and consequences (eg, aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition) in order to make fully informed decisions. Partnering with the patient and family in shared decision making helps to ensure that the plan is consistent with their preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Family members are more likely to adhere to specific feeding strategies if they understand the physiologic and psychologic rationales for the recommendation and if they have been included in the decision. The medical team and family caring for a patient with progressive dysphagia should begin to consider the patient&rsquo;s wishes early in the disease process in order to incorporate them into the care plan.</p><p>In the face of insufficient or risky oral intake, making decisions about optimal nutrition can be time consuming and emotionally exhausting. Continuing to orally feed a patient who is a known aspirator or the corollary (withholding food and liquid because of the danger of aspirating) causes medical providers and caregivers to feel that they may be willfully inflicting harm on the patient. Many family members forgo the option of nonoral feeding because of the attendant complications and the possibility of increased suffering. However, the most frequent concern is of &ldquo;starving the patient&rdquo; if nutrition is inadequate and the decision is made not to pursue artificial nutrition. These fears often stem from long-held personal and cultural beliefs. Decisions about feeding entail some of the most difficult decision making faced by patients with a serious life-limiting illness and their loved ones and may require several meetings among the patient, caregiver, and treatment team. Decision aids regarding the pros and cons of nonoral nutrition can be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The treating team should convey that there is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; way, should offer clear explanations of the physiologic response to not <span class=\"nowrap\">eating/drinking,</span> and should support the caregivers irrespective of their decision regarding nutrition. These issues are addressed in detail elsewhere.

These strategies may compensate for impaired swallowing function by altering head or neck posture to redirect bolus flow, heighten sensory awareness, or change bolus characteristics to improve the safety of swallowing; their purpose is not rehabilitative in nature. The chief advantage of these strategies is that they are simple for the patient and caregiver to implement and require no complex instruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179304513\"><span class=\"h3\">Postural modifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postural changes or changes in head position during swallowing serve to divert the food or liquid away from the airway in an attempt to prevent aspiration and improve bolus drive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F95602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95602 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. They do not change the swallowing physiology. </p><p>The chin tuck posture, a commonly used strategy, narrows the lumen of the pharynx by increasing tongue base retraction and pressure on the bolus, and restricts the opening of the larynx during swallowing. These functional effects potentially reduce the risk of laryngeal penetration and aspiration. In cases of delayed onset of the swallow response, however, the chin tuck posture may induce or exacerbate aspiration, and therefore, it is not safe in all cases.</p><p>Head rotation toward the weak side may benefit patients with asymmetric swallowing function, such as neurologically based dysphagia or following treatment for head and neck cancer. This postural change may promote bolus flow down the intact side by obstructing the weak side, thereby preventing post-swallow residue or aspiration. </p><p>These and other postural modification strategies may be used in isolation or in combination, depending on the nature of the underlying swallowing pathophysiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F95602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95602 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3074993807\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased sensory awareness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intact sensation is essential for a timely and organized swallow. Sensory input for swallowing can be impaired due to certain neurologic dysfunctions, such as brainstem stroke and dementia, as well as in patients treated with radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Sensory enhancement techniques may focus on taste (sour) or temperature (cold or warm extremes), or include increasing downward pressure of a spoon against the tongue when presenting food in the mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>]. These techniques may elicit a quicker pharyngeal swallow response. Some patients benefit from receiving food or liquid at a slower rate, while others are more efficient with larger boluses. Enhancing the bolus characteristics to include more texture can sometimes induce mastication more readily than a bolus that is both flavorless and homogeneous in texture. This is particularly relevant for patients with advanced dementia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000003434\"><span class=\"h3\">Swallowing exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, direct swallowing interventions, such as strengthening exercise programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/13-15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,18</a>], are of limited value in the palliative care population. Swallowing dysfunction in patients with life-limiting disease is often associated with progressive and advancing processes with deteriorating function (eg, degenerative neurologic disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] or advanced dementia), and a direct strengthening regimen may result in increased burden and limited benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

If the decision is to continue with oral intake, the safest diet should be suggested, and aspiration precautions should be introduced using data derived from the swallowing assessment. (See <a href=\"#H179304435\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p>The guiding principle is to ingest the maximum amount of calories and hydration for the least amount of effort. Nutritionists can provide individualized suggestions for calorie-dense foods or high-calorie supplements, taking the patient&rsquo;s metabolic status into consideration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179304519\"><span class=\"h3\">Alterations in food and liquid texture and consistency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modifying the texture of solid foods and consistency of liquids is widely used in the management of patients with dysphagia and may improve the safety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ease of oral consumption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F95391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95391 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, low acceptability, resulting in poor adherence to modified food textures and liquids, can contribute to an increased risk of inadequate nutrition and hydration. As such, these modifications should be used judiciously and in the context of shared decision making. Alterations in texture and viscosity must be balanced with foods that are pleasurable and appetizing for the patient in spite of their texture modification.</p><p>The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) is an international effort to standardize the terminology and definitions surrounding texture-modified diets to improve patient safety and interprofessional communication among health care professionals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F116403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116403 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This classification system uses seven levels of thickness, from 0 to 4 for thin liquids and from 4 to 7 for foods. Thickness is measured using either a syringe flow test for the viscosity of liquids or a fork drip test for solids and thicker liquids that may not flow through a syringe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2672517023\"><span class=\"h4\">Solid foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The texture of solid foods may be modified to accommodate dysphagic symptoms. Foods may be pureed, chopped, or diced; prepared soft; and served with gravies and sauces to moisten them. Patients are frequently loathe to relinquish favorite foods and may prefer to eat less of a more textured item for a protracted period than to alter the food to a consistency that is easier to chew and swallow. At least some data in hospitalized patients over the age of 60 suggest that patients consuming a texture-modified diet had significantly lower nutritional intake in terms of both energy and protein compared with those consuming a regular diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In certain circumstances, altered food consistency or high-calorie nutritional supplements may be the only way a patient can continue to eat orally (eg, a patient with esophageal carcinoma or a severe esophageal motility disorder).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2650698945\"><span class=\"h4\">Liquids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thickened liquids may be easier to control than thin liquids in patients with weak lingual and pharyngeal musculature. The properties of slower flow and increased viscosity may reduce misdirection of the bolus into the airway. Thin liquids can be thickened to resemble nectar, honey, or pudding consistencies. Unfortunately, few naturally occurring dietary fluids are sufficiently viscous to offer protection from aspiration. Typically, liquids are thickened with a powder form of modified cornstarch, but sometimes these substances are unstable in fluids and can become too thick over time and lose their appeal. Xanthan gum or cellulose gel-based thickeners are more stable and have a greater likeability factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thickened liquids release the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract and do not alter the body&rsquo;s absorption rate of fluids; however, poor adherence to recommended thickened liquids may lead to reduced fluid intake and an increased risk of dehydration as well as reduced comfort from dry mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are limited high-quality data to support a preference for thickened liquids over the use of postural modifications, such as the chin tuck, especially on the risk of aspiration of thin liquids, and no one strategy can be recommended over any other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>].

Contrary to popular belief, the presence of a long-term tracheostomy tube, with or without mechanical ventilation, does not preclude safe oral intake. In addition, an inflated tracheostomy tube cuff is not fully protective against aspiration. The seal in the trachea is not complete at the common esophagotracheal wall, and secretions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liquid material may collect above the cuff and, ultimately, can be aspirated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>While many patients with an endotracheal tube have swallowing dysfunction, it is usually the illness that prompted the placement of the tracheostomy, rather than the tracheostomy itself, that is responsible for the swallowing dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H179305671\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia can predispose the patient to aspiration and impair the ability to maintain nutrition and hydration and to adhere to medication regimens. Swallowing disorders significantly impact quality of life and cause distress and burden on both the patient and caregiver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific clinical features, disease states, patient characteristics, and medical interventions that can predict an increased risk of swallowing dysfunction are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F116401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116401 \">table 1</a>). Recognizing factors that are clinically associated with or that cause a swallowing impairment can guide referral for appropriate assessment and management. (See <a href=\"#H1880341\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect a swallowing disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive swallowing assessment by the speech-language pathologist (SLP) aims to identify the underlying physiologic nature of the disorder and determine interventions that may alleviate dysphagia. (See <a href=\"#H179304435\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The swallowing evaluation includes history gathering and clinical observation. Further instrumental assessment may be warranted, either radiographically or endoscopically, depending on safety, appropriateness, and consistency with the patient&rsquo;s goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H12413142\" class=\"local\">'Direct observation of swallowing function'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12413412\" class=\"local\">'Instrumental evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of dysphagia in patients with serious illness is facilitative, and goals focus on preventing functional decline, retaining safe and effective oral feeding, and maximizing quality of life and comfort. Swallowing intervention should be closely aligned with the goals of care and should support the patient&rsquo;s wishes. (See <a href=\"#H179304501\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient autonomy and shared decision making are critical ethical principles; however, a patient&rsquo;s choice to continue with oral nutrition must be accompanied by a clear understanding of the possible risks and consequences (eg, aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition) in order to make fully informed decisions. Partnering with the patient and family in shared decision making helps to ensure that the plan is consistent with their preferences. (See <a href=\"#H3852971771\" class=\"local\">'Shared decision making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifying the texture of solid foods and consistency of liquids is widely used in the management of patients with dysphagia and may improve the safety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ease of oral consumption. These modifications should be used judiciously and in the context of shared decision making. (See <a href=\"#H179304519\" class=\"local\">'Alterations in food and liquid texture and consistency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3852971771\" class=\"local\">'Shared decision making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication administration can present enormous challenges to patients with dysphagia. Finding alternative modes of presentation (liquids, crushed, orally disintegrating tablets, compounded) can be critical to providing the patient with comfort at the end of life. (See <a href=\"#H866678829\" class=\"local\">'Managing oral medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to pursue nonoral artificial nutrition and hydration has significant ramifications for both the patient and caregivers. The patient-caregiver unit must be appropriately informed about the benefits and risks of nutritional options in order to make decisions that reflect consent and refusal. The placement of feeding tubes should only be considered when the benefits (improving quality of life <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality) clearly outweigh the burdens. (See <a href=\"#H4155159441\" class=\"local\">'Artificial nutrition and hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An overabundance of secretions or change in secretion viscosity and composition may result from impaired swallowing. In addition, airway clearance can be compromised in dysphagic individuals. The ability to effectively cough to clear secretions and aspirated material can reduce pulmonary infections and respiratory difficulties. (See <a href=\"#H1527361487\" class=\"local\">'Secretion management and airway clearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a long-term tracheostomy tube, with or without mechanical ventilation, does not preclude oral intake. However, careful evaluation of swallowing function is needed. Tracheal suctioning to improve pulmonary toilet can be performed after meals.
