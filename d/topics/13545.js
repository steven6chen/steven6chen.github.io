In the United States, for example, there are 1.5 million regular cocaine users and approximately 353,000 regular methamphetamine users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-stimulant-use-disorders-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Only psychosocial interventions have proven efficacy in reducing stimulant use in patients with stimulant use disorder, but these treatments alone are insufficient for many patients, prompting research into the neurobiology of stimulant use disorder and trials of several augmenting medications.</p><p>Pharmacotherapy for stimulant use disorders is discussed here. Our approach to selecting treatment for stimulant use disorder is described separately.

Cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine have similar mechanisms of action. This suggests that medications that show some evidence of efficacy for cocaine use may also be efficacious for amphetamine and methamphetamine, and vice versa. Clinical trials have begun testing this hypothesis, but few results have been published to date. Differences in stimulants&rsquo; mechanisms of action are summarized below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3352820600\"><span class=\"h2\">Cocaine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reinforcing properties of cocaine are mediated by its ability to block the dopamine transporter and increase dopaminergic activity in critical brain regions.

These drugs were initially marketed in the United States as &ldquo;bath salts&rdquo; or &ldquo;plant food&rdquo; to avoid controlled-substance restrictions. The mechanism of action of cathinones is similar to that of methamphetamine. Cathinones block the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, as well as stimulate the release of dopamine.

Only psychosocial interventions have proven efficacy in reducing stimulant use in patients with stimulant use disorder, but these treatments alone are insufficient for many patients. Some medications have shown promise in trials of patients using cocaine or methamphetamine, but more robust clinical trials are needed before their use can be recommended.

Earlier clinical trials of these medications in patients with cocaine use disorder have found mixed results compared with placebo and high dropout rates, but a more recent trial with a high completion rate found reduced cocaine use across primary and secondary outcomes in patients also receiving heroin maintenance treatment for heroin dependence. Further trials are needed to replicate these results in stimulant dependent patients in more routine treatment settings.
