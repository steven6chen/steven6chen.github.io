It is now understood that, among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, LV systolic dysfunction can result from myocardial necrosis and remodeling, myocardial hibernation, or repetitive myocardial stunning. While myocardial necrosis is irreversible, systolic dysfunction resulting from hibernation and stunning are potentially reversible states of ventricular dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of stunned or hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with chronic heart failure have an admixture of all three pathophysiologic entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Clinical studies have shown that viable myocardium can be demonstrated in a substantial number of patients with CHD and LV dysfunction, even in the absence of angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].

Therefore, while several clinical and laboratory parameters including anginal symptoms, absence of Q waves on the electrocardiogram, and regional hypokinesis (as opposed to akinesis) on echocardiography indicate the presence of some viability, a systematic assessment of the degree and extent of viability is generally thought to be helpful for management planning and prognostication.</p><p>To the extent that improvement in regional or global LV function, and thereby prognosis, is a significant goal in such patients, the ability to accurately assess regional myocardial viability in a dysfunctional territory prior to revascularization becomes an important component of the decision making process.</p><p>For the detection of viability, noninvasive imaging techniques depend on the demonstration of cell membrane integrity (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> imaging), intact mitochondrial function (technetium-99m [Tc-99m] sestamibi and tetrofosmin imaging), preserved myocardial metabolism (positron emission tomography [PET] with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose), microvascular integrity (myocardial contrast echocardiography), or the absence of scar tissue (gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging) in areas of dysfunctional myocardium.</p><p>The most commonly used radionuclide imaging techniques for assessing myocardial viability in this setting will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50864 \">figure 2</a>).

The myocardial uptake of thallium-201 is a sarcolemmal membrane <span class=\"nowrap\">Na/K</span> ATPase-dependent active process requiring cell membrane integrity, and is therefore indicative of myocardial viability. Thallium-201 uptake by myocytes is also a reflection of regional perfusion (required for delivery of tracer to the myocyte) and viability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic properties of myocardial perfusion agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several different approaches have been employed to optimize the information obtained from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> imaging. The table lists the various protocols that have been used for viability assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74921 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress-redistribution imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1977, it was reported that some stress-induced thallium defects could normalize or &quot;redistribute&quot; on serial images repeated several hours later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It was proposed that regional thallium redistribution activity represented the extent of regional myocardial viability. As a result, stress-redistribution thallium imaging following a single stress injection became the standard imaging protocol for assessing the presence of coronary disease and the extent of inducible ischemia.</p><p>The demonstration of reversible ischemia by the conventional protocol (immediate stress imaging followed by four hour redistribution imaging) implies the presence of viable myocardium. However, up to 47 percent of segments that have fixed defects at four hours show evidence of viability on PET scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] or recover either perfusion or function following revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Therefore, several modifications of the stress-4 hour redistribution protocol were developed to improve the accuracy of viability detection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Late redistribution imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some instances, the redistribution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> appears to take longer than the four hours allowed in standard stress-redistribution protocols. This variability may reflect relatively lower blood levels of thallium-201 throughout the redistribution period, thereby reducing thallium-201 input over time into severely ischemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>This observation led to the development of late redistribution protocols, which generally involve redistribution imaging 18 to 24 hours after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> injection. With these protocols, thallium-201 redistribution is seen in a significant number of perfusion defects deemed fixed by imaging at four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. In one study, for example, late distribution at 24 hours occurred in one-fifth of defects thought to be fixed by conventional four-hour imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Late redistribution has been validated as an accurate predictor of viability, with up to 95 percent of segments with late redistribution showing improved stress perfusion following revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, even with delayed imaging, a proportion of segments with fixed defects improve function after revascularization, suggesting that some viable segments may never redistribute unless blood levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> are augmented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In one study, 37 percent of segments labeled as fixed defects even after late imaging improved perfusion after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Thus, the presence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> uptake at late redistribution is an accurate marker of regional viability while its absence may underestimate viable myocardial tissue to a significant degree. Late redistribution imaging may also result in images of poor quality due to tracer washout and decay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Thallium-201 reinjection protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reinjection of a second, smaller dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> immediately following the redistribution images increases the blood level of thallium-201, and may circumvent some of the problems associated with redistribution imaging, resulting in enhanced detection of stress defect reversibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This method has been shown to identify viable territories in as many as 50 to 70 percent of regions which were deemed to be scar by standard three- to four-hour redistribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Additional delayed imaging does not appear to improve sensitivity of viability detection with this protocol, which has positive and negative predictive values of 69 percent and 89 percent, respectively, thus indicating good sensitivity and modest specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/25,26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,29</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, a minority of segments that demonstrate reversible defects at redistribution appear to have more severe defects following reinjection. This infrequent phenomenon has been ascribed to &quot;differential uptake,&quot; a relatively smaller increment in regional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> uptake following reinjection in ischemic compared with normal zones, giving the appearance of a defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The implication of differential uptake is that in most patients, it is probably necessary to obtain all three image sets (stress, redistribution, and reinjection) to optimize assessment of ischemia and viability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rest-redistribution imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> was initially thought of as a blood flow tracer, a defect seen on an image taken soon after a rest injection of thallium-201 was assumed to be associated with regional infarction. However, a significant percentage of resting thallium-201 defects show redistribution when reimaged several hours after injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Segments which show a reversible resting thallium-201 defect often have improved perfusion after revascularization, suggesting that this finding is indicative of regional myocardial viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. An increase of tracer uptake of 10 percent or more on the redistribution images is usually considered indicative of viability in this setting. In contrast to stress-redistribution thallium-201 protocol for viability assessment, a four-hour redistribution protocol is generally adequate after a resting injection of thallium-201. More delayed rest-redistribution imaging has not been found to improve viability detection.</p><p>Rest-redistribution imaging is useful when viability information is required after a dual isotope rest-stress study has demonstrated an apparently fixed perfusion defect. In dual isotope protocols, a rest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> study is followed by a stress study with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technetium-tc-99m-sestamibi-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">technetium Tc-99m sestamibi</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technetium-tc-99m-tetrofosmin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">technetium Tc-99m tetrofosmin</a>. This has the advantage of a shorter overall study time compared with a single-isotope (ie, Tc-99m based tracer only) rest-stress study. When a fixed defect is encountered on a dual isotope study, the patient can be brought back the next day for delayed thallium-201 imaging for viability assessment. At this time, Tc-99m, which has a half-life of around six hours, is no longer present in the myocardium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> uptake on redistribution images further improves the prediction of viability, with higher counts being more reliably predictive of improvement in regional perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The quantitation of relative regional thallium-201 activity in rest-redistribution studies is generally highly concordant with findings from stress-redistribution-reinjection imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Viability assessment based on quantification of thallium-201 uptake more accurately predicts improvement in perfusion or function after revascularization than a dichotomous visual analysis of the presence or absence of stress defect reversibility.</p><p>Quantitative techniques may be of particular utility in segments that appear on inspection to have fixed defects. In such segments, significant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> uptake may still be present. The presence of thallium uptake &gt;50 percent to 60 percent of that in normal segments is indicative of the presence of viable myocardium as demonstrated in comparative studies with PET imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. One report, for example, evaluated a group of patients with planar thallium-201 stress-redistribution imaging: 45 percent of fixed thallium-201 defects preoperatively showed improved thallium-201 uptake following bypass grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, with the use of quantitative analysis of the magnitude of thallium-201 uptake within these fixed defects, stratification of segments into those more or less likely to improve perfusion after revascularization was achieved.</p><p>In general however, fixed defects, even mild ones, are less likely to improve resting function following revascularization than reversible defects because this pattern may be seen both in &quot;transmurally hibernating&quot; segments, which have a high likelihood of functional recovery after revascularization, and in segments with subendocardial necrosis with retained epicardial viability, which are far less likely to improve resting function after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/10,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,35</a>]. Thus, the use of quantitation to define a &quot;cut-off&quot; threshold for viability (usually 50 to 60 percent of activity in the normal segments) may not accurately reflect the likelihood of myocardial recovery.</p><p>Instead, it may be more effective to use quantitative methods to define a probability of recovery. There appears to be a continuous relationship between the amount of tracer uptake and the likelihood of functional recovery after revascularization. In one study, 56 percent of segments with 50 to 60 percent uptake and 88 percent of segments with greater than 80 percent uptake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> improved after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nitrate enhanced imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitrate administration enhances the flow to peri-infarct regions and improves <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> delivery to myocytes.

The non-nitrate enhanced protocol demonstrated reversible ischemia in 29 patients; the incidence of cardiac events was similar in those with and without a reversible defect (48 versus 32 percent, p = NS) after a 21-month follow-up. In comparison, a nitrate enhanced thallium-201 scan detected a &quot;reversible&quot; defect in 68 patients.

The uptake and retention of these compounds within myocytes depends upon the presence of intact electrochemical gradients across sarcolemmal and mitochondrial membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The technetium label imparts better gamma camera imaging characteristics to these agents compared with thallium-201, and their myocardial uptake generally parallels myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A significant difference from thallium-201 is that these agents show minimal redistribution within the myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

However, the uptake and retention of this agent requires the presence of intact sarcolemmal and mitochondrial membranes, making it conceptually a good tracer of regional cellular viability. It was also thought that the absence of significant myocardial redistribution would result in underestimation of viability in areas with severe resting hypoperfusion (and therefore, poor initial tracer uptake).

When the presence or absence of clinically significant amounts of viable myocardium can be determined confidently from the resting study, stress testing is not required for the assessment of myocardial viability. However, when resting tracer uptake is in the &quot;intermediate range,&quot; as might occur in regions of non-transmural infarction subtended by a non-critically stenosed coronary artery, the demonstration of inducible ischemia in these regions argues for the presence of viable myocardium. In one study, the finding of reversible ischemia was a more powerful predictor of functional recovery than a fixed defect with a similar degree of resting tracer uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) is an established noninvasive method of evaluating myocardial perfusion and viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This technique has the advantage of being able to assess both perfusion and metabolism. PET requires the use of positron-emitting isotopes (such as oxygen-15, carbon-11, nitrogen-13, and fluorine-18), which are cyclotron-produced.</p><p>Ischemia shifts myocyte metabolism preferentially to glucose from fatty acids. Thus, uptake of a glucose analog, fluorine-18 labeled deoxyglucose (FDG) by myocytes in an area of dysfunctional myocardium indicates metabolic activity and thus, viability. Regional perfusion can also be assessed with an agent that remains in the vascular space and demonstrates the distribution of blood flow (such as nitrogen <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrogen-13-ammonia-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">n-13 ammonia</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rubidium-rb-82-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rubidium rb-82</a>). As a result, PET imaging has the potential to differentiate between normal, stunned, hibernating, and necrotic myocardium. The presence of enhanced FDG uptake in regions of decreased blood flow (known as a &quot;PET mismatch&quot;) defines hibernating myocardium by PET imaging, while a concordant reduction in both metabolism and flow (&quot;PET match&quot;) is thought to represent predominantly necrotic myocardium. Regional dysfunction in presence of normal perfusion is indicative of stunning.</p><p>Myocardial segments with significant reductions in both blood flow and FDG uptake have only a 20 percent chance of functional improvement following revascularization. In comparison, dysfunctional territories deemed to be hibernating by PET have approximately an 80 to 85 percent chance of functional improvement following revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11,29,53-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29,53-58</a>].</p><p>One study, for example, examined 43 patients with regional asynergy and a mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 41 percent who were evaluated by PET imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Clinical experience shows that some myocardial segments that appear severely hypoperfused on SPECT show F-18 FDG uptake, and are thus viable.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with known severe coronary disease and known significant regional and global LV dysfunction, the extent of myocardial viability should be considered, even if angina is not present, since revascularization may be appropriate in some cases. Clinical studies have thus far failed to demonstrate superiority of one perfusion tracer (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a>, Tc-99m sestamibi, or Tc-99m tetrofosmin) over the others for viability assessment, and individual centers should use standard site protocols. Imaging of metabolism with fluorine-18 labeled deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) imaging may identify viable dysfunctional myocardium with somewhat higher sensitivity than the SPECT techniques. However, a modest-sized randomized trial suggested that overall clinical decision making results in similar outcomes when using SPECT versus PET techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. FDG PET imaging should be performed in experienced centers.</p><p>When the presence and extent of preserved myocardial viability is the only question of concern, a resting perfusion scan should be performed first. The administration of sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> five minutes before tracer injection at rest may slightly improve sensitivity for viability detection. When the amount of resting tracer uptake clearly establishes the presence (or absence) of viability, stress testing is not generally required. However, in cases of &quot;indeterminate&quot; resting scans, the demonstration of perfusion defect reversibility on stress testing provides additional information indicative of viability. Stress testing is also necessary in patients who may have areas of ischemia as well as viability.</p><p>From a practical standpoint, it is reasonable to revascularize patients with LV systolic dysfunction and coronary heart disease with good coronary target vessels and relatively low surgical risk. For the patient at relatively high surgical risk (eg, an older adult patient with severe LV systolic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and other co-morbidities), the demonstration of significant residual myocardial viability may make the risk-benefit ratio more favorable for surgery. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gheorghiade M, Bonow RO.
