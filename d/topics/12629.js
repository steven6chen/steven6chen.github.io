It commonly results from overuse and occurs in workers and recreational athletes. The majority of tendinopathies present in the chronic stage, with symptoms over three months in duration.</p><p>Normally, tendon consists of tightly-packed collagen fibers. In tendinopathies, the collagen is in a state of disrepair, with proliferation and chronic irritation of neurovascular repair tissue in the tendon and its linings (paratendon and endotendon). This pattern is similar in most tendinopathies of the upper and lower extremity. Although complete or partial tendon ruptures may result from overuse, the treatment principles differ markedly from overuse tendinopathies and are therefore discussed separately. Paratendinopathies (eg, de Quervain's tenosynovitis) are also distinct in that the primary pathology is the paratendon rather than the tendon proper and are not discussed here.</p><p>The general treatment of chronic tendinopathy will be discussed here. The pathophysiology of tendinopathy and the management of specific tendinopathies are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's history should elucidate what type of training or activity led to the tendinopathy and determine the level of function to which the patient aims to return.</p><p>Validated, reliable, and simple functional assessment scores, such as the Victoria Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) for patellar tendinopathy or VISA-A for Achilles tendinopathy, can help the clinician to grade symptoms and determine patient function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55215\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55215 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76270\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76270 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Such scores also provide a useful means of monitoring recovery during rehabilitation. The VISA and VISA-A questionnaires can be completed in five minutes or less.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of approaches have been advocated for the treatment of tendinopathy. The most common and well-supported strategies are presented here. Less well-established and investigational approaches are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Investigational treatments'</a> below.)</p><p>The success of conservative treatment frequently depends upon a coordinated program of education, relative rest, including a reduction of aggravating activities, correction of any underlying biomechanical faults, active rehabilitation, and a gradual increase in tendon-loading activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Activity modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who engage in provocative tendon-loading activities, it is important that coaches and employers be aware of the treatment plan, particularly the need to limit the volume and intensity of loads placed upon the injured tendon for a designated period.</p><p>Normally, water in the extracellular matrix enables tendons to absorb force, making them more resistant to strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. However, with sustained or repetitive loading, water is displaced or &quot;wrung out&quot; from the tendon, reducing its capacity to absorb force, thereby increasing tissue strain and susceptibility to injury. Thus, a load that is initially manageable can produce tendon damage with excessive repetition. This phenomenon is called &quot;tissue creep,&quot; and is particularly relevant to injured or tendinopathic tendons, which contain higher quantities of hydrophilic substances (glycosaminoglycans). To minimize tissue creep, increases in training load and functional activity should be gradual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Biomechanical modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies have found associations between abnormal biomechanics or specific performance characteristics and the development of tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. As an example, computer users in one study were randomly assigned to use four different keyboard types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A reduction in tendon and other musculoskeletal complaints occurred after several months in patients using an ergonomic keyboard. According to a small prospective cohort study of auto workers, epicondylitis was strongly associated with the amount of time spent with the wrist out of neutral position during work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A systematic review of prospective and cohort studies concluded that specific biomechanical faults (eg, increased eversion range of motion of the rearfoot) during running may predispose to Achilles tendinopathy, and that biomechanical assessment of running may be helpful in making treatment decisions for those with an overuse tendinopathy stemming from running [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In general, the biomechanics of the task responsible for the tendinopathy should be analyzed and optimized by an ergonomics specialist, a trained physiotherapist or kinesiologist, a knowledgeable sports medicine clinician, or a comparable expert. This treatment approach has not been studied in large, randomized trials but is supported by clinical experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Heavy load exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe that slow, controlled, progressive exercise using relatively heavy loads should serve as the cornerstone of treatment for most cases of tendinopathy, including cases of Achilles, patellar, and lateral epicondyle tendinopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quadriceps-muscle-and-tendon-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quadriceps muscle and tendon injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are several types of resistance exercise. Eccentric exercise involves the careful application of a load (ie, muscular exertion) to a lengthening muscle; concentric exercise is the application of a load to a shortening (or contracting) muscle; isometric exercise is the development of tension within a muscle in a static position (neither lengthening nor shortening). The type and amount of loading prescribed should be individually tailored to the patient, taking into consideration their pain and fatigability, and keeping in mind the level of function to aim to regain (ie, job or sporting demands). The progression should be gradual and carefully monitored.</p><p>Several randomized and observational studies, performed primarily in patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy, have found eccentric exercise to be an effective treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. Subsequent studies suggest that heavy load concentric exercise performed in a slow, controlled manner (eg, six second contractions) may be equally beneficial, as determined by improved VISA scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Further study is needed to confirm these findings about concentric and combined exercise.</p><p>The strain from exercising with large tensile loads, moved in a slow, controlled manner, appears to stimulate tissue remodeling and, to a limited extent, normalization of tendon structure. Such exercise is often uncomfortable when performed, but done properly, it should not cause severe pain or result in any worsening of symptoms (eg, pain or joint swelling the next day). During rehabilitative exercise, discomfort should be kept within moderate levels that do not suggest further injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Specific instructions for implementing this therapeutic exercise program are beyond the scope of this review. The performance of rehabilitative exercise in the management of Achilles tendinopathy and lateral epicondylitis are discussed separately; a basic treatment approach to tendinopathy is described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Regardless of the tendon involved, it is important that a knowledgeable therapist supervise the patient embarking upon a heavy load rehabilitation regimen. The therapist must ensure that exercise technique is biomechanically sound, and the intensity and frequency of the program are appropriate to the patient and clinical circumstance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For rotator cuff tendinopathy, an evidence-based approach is to prescribe an individualized exercise program that addresses not only the muscle of the injured tendon (eg, supraspinatus) but also the coordination and function of the scapulothoracic and scapulohumeral joints: in one small, randomized trial, this treatment approach achieved better clinical outcomes than arthroscopic shoulder surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Stretching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stretching is useful for tendinopathy patients, both for symptomatic relief of muscle spasm and for lengthening of functionally shortened muscle-tendon units. Larger tendons, like the Achilles, may be stretched manually by a therapist, particularly when adhesions are suspected of limiting tendon movement. However, emphasis should be on the patient regularly performing stretching as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program. These exercises should incorporate a steady hold to maximize muscle lengthening.</p><p>Stretching has long been advocated to prevent tendinopathy. However, a systematic review found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of stretching to prevent Achilles tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Another systematic review found no clear evidence that stretching prevents sports-related injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Despite the absence of definitive studies, most sports clinicians and physiotherapists routinely advocate stretching for prevention and treatment of tendinopathies. We suggest the following guidelines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform stretching exercises following activity, when muscles are warm; stretching before activity does not prevent injury and may cause transient decreases in strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Before activity, perform a gradual active warm-up that involves the major muscles to be used. Stretching of warm muscles induces greater gains in flexibility than stretching without warming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold static stretches for 15 to 30 seconds; longer holds provide no additional benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretch regularly (three to five days per week): flexibility gains from a single stretching session last 90 minutes, but gains from regular regimens persist for weeks after cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>Alternatives to static stretching, such as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (which incorporates brief periods of muscular contraction during stretching) and dynamic stretching (which involves active movement of the joint), may be beneficial, but studies are limited and further research is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ice or heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controversy surrounding the use of ice or heat to treat chronic tendinopathy stems from historical debates about the role of inflammation in tendinopathy. One small study found that ice provided no benefit when added to a program of eccentric exercise to treat lateral epicondylalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Conversely, one small randomized trial found that heat (delivered by microwave diathermy) led to improved patient satisfaction with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Heat may be useful for treating muscle spasm associated with tendinopathy. We believe that neither ice nor heat are important treatments after the acute phase of injury, but both may serve as useful adjuncts during ongoing treatment of chronic tendinopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint mobilization and friction massage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is little evidence to support their use, certain manual techniques may serve as useful adjuncts to active rehabilitation. Clinical experience suggests that joint or muscle dysfunction contributes to altered movement patterns and abnormal tendon loading, and this dysfunction may be amenable to treatment with tissue mobilization techniques performed by an appropriately trained therapist.</p><p>In one randomized trial, patients with chronic tendinopathy of the lateral epicondyle were randomly assigned to receive physiotherapy including joint mobilization (mobilization with movement, or MWM), corticosteroid injections, or a wait-and-see approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Patients in the MWM group recovered more quickly than those in the wait-and-see group, and had significantly better long term outcomes than the corticosteroid group. Case studies also support the use of MWM for other upper extremity tendinopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Historically, friction massage applied directly to the painful tendon (the Cyriax approach) was considered an important treatment for tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Animal studies demonstrate that friction massage can increase tendon fibroblast activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, a systematic review concluded that friction massage combined with other physiotherapy modalities does not consistently improve pain, grip strength, or functional status in tendinopathy patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This is in line with our clinical experience and subsequent clinical trials, which show minimal benefit from friction massage compared with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiinflammatory medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of tendinopathies demonstrate minimal or no cellular inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, there may be a low level of biochemical inflammation present that contributes to pain and which can be reduced with antiinflammatory medications, particularly during the early phases of tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral NSAIDs, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, may be helpful for short-term (eg, five to seven days) pain relief. We prefer to avoid long-term NSAID use in the treatment of tendinopathy given the absence of inflammation in most cases and the side effects associated with chronic use.</p><p>Multiple controlled trials support the effectiveness of topical NSAID gel or iontophoresis for short-term pain control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. Topical NSAIDs may cause fewer systemic side effects than oral NSAIDs and systematic reviews have found no difference in long-term treatment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>]. Should patients require ongoing treatment with high doses of analgesics despite optimal conservative management, alternative diagnoses, such as partial tendon tear or inflammatory arthropathy, should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness and risks associated with glucocorticoid treatment of tendinopathy appear to vary with the duration of symptoms and the mode of drug delivery (eg, local injection versus systemic treatment). Glucocorticoids may be useful in patients with acute tendinopathy. As an example, in one small randomized trial, glucocorticoids delivered by iontophoresis improved pain and stiffness in patients with Achilles tendinopathy of less than three months duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, in chronic tendinopathy, glucocorticoids are potentially harmful and we suggest they be avoided. Glucocorticoids inhibit collagen synthesis, possibly increasing the risk of tendon rupture, and have not been shown to improve long term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In patients with chronic symptoms of patellar or Achilles tendinopathy, glucocorticoid injections have not proven effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/20,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,49</a>]. A systematic review concluded that subacromial injections are effective at reducing symptoms, but the patients included suffered from a variety of pathologies (eg, adhesive capsulitis, labral injuries) so it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. According to another systematic review, glucocorticoid injections for lateral epicondylalgia (ie, epicondylitis) reduce pain initially but ultimately increase recurrence rates and lead to worse long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/46,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,51</a>]. A subsequent systematic review of randomized trials involving glucocorticoid injections for patients with lateral epicondylalgia or tendinopathy of the rotator cuff or Achilles tendon reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of alternative injection therapies for chronic tendinopathy are under investigation. These therapies have not been compared with others in large controlled clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19266642\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical glyceryl trinitrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patches placed directly over affected tendons deliver nitric oxide, a potent signaling molecule that stimulates collagen synthesis in tendon cells. Topical GTN is the subject of six randomized controlled trials, three of which demonstrated reductions in symptoms and improvement in function in patients with chronic tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>]. All three successful trials originate from the same research group and further validation of this treatment is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p>When using GTN, the skin should be monitored for signs of irritation, and the patient should be aware that dizziness and headaches are potential side effects. Nitric oxide therapy should be used in conjunction with an active rehabilitation regime. It is contraindicated in patients with hypotension, head injury, severe anemia, and those taking any other source of nitrates (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolotherapy involves the injection of a substance, usually dextrose and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, intratendinously in order to stimulate a repair response. One small randomized controlled trial in patients with chronic epicondylalgia found that prolotherapy provided significant pain relief and improvement in grip strength 16 weeks after the initiation of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. A small, single blind randomized trial in chronic Achilles tendinopathy patients found greater improvement in VISA-A score at six weeks and 12 months with prolotherapy plus eccentric exercise compared to eccentric exercise alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Another small, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial found that a greater percentage of patients with chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy experienced significant pain relief after receiving dextrose-lidocaine (16 out of 27) compared with patients receiving a superficial injection of saline (7 out of 26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]; however, there was no difference in sonographic appearance between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

Injections of a sclerosing substance (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polidocanol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polidocanol</a>) to reduce neovascularity have shown promise in a number of small clinical trials for chronic midportion Achilles and patellar tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Injections target abnormal blood vessels using ultrasound guidance. Pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this technique for patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis, flexor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy, supraspinatus tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/58,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,65-67</a>]. A retrospective observational study of 113 Achilles tendinopathy patients failed to confirm the initial reports of clinical benefit with polidocanol treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Most studies of such therapies are limited by small sample size; well-performed randomized trials are needed, particularly in patients with chronic tendinopathy who have failed standard conservative treatment involving eccentric or heavy load exercise. </p><p>A 2013 systematic review of 19 small trials (17 randomized) of mostly limited quality involving 1088 participants and a range of conditions including tendinopathy and tendon tears concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support platelet-rich therapy in the treatment of soft tissue injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The results of individual trials vary. In a prospective cohort study, high-level athletes with patellar tendinopathy were able to return to full sporting activity after being treated with dry needling and autologous blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Conversely, small randomized trials of patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy demonstrated no benefit from platelet rich plasma (PRP) or autologous blood injection when added to an eccentric training program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. A similar study performed in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy also reported no benefit from PRP when performed in patients treated with standard physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Since publication of the above systematic review, a small but well-conducted randomized trial of 60 patients with chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy that included tissue analysis was published, and the results suggest that PRP may be harmful in a post-surgical setting (acromial arthroplasty) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2016 of 18 randomized trials examining the effectiveness of PRP for various tendinopathies in 1066 patients concluded that there is &ldquo;good evidence&rdquo; that a single injection of leukocyte-rich PRP (LR-PRP) under ultrasound guidance improves outcomes in tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. However, this review contains several methodologic flaws. As one example, the outcomes in PRP-treated patients were not compared to outcomes of control groups, but rather to baseline values, and therefore the condition&rsquo;s natural history was not accounted for. Most of the studies in this review were previously analyzed in the review described above, which concluded that the quality of evidence is &quot;very low&rdquo; and the efficacy of PRP for tendinopathy unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Studies in patients with epicondylalgia (epicondylitis) are described separately.

A randomized trial of 64 patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy reported improved pain and function (VISA-A score) at 16 and 24 weeks after 24 acupuncture treatments, but neither the patients nor investigators were blinded in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

A number of clinical trials have examined the efficacy of ESWT in tendinopathy and found marginal improvements over placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/82-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-85</a>]. These trials have involved a range of treatment parameters. </p><p>Systematic reviews have reached mixed conclusions about the effectiveness of ESWT for treating tendinopathy. Two reviews concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend shock wave therapy for lateral epicondylalgia or non-calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/46,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,86</a>]. However, while a 2011 review concluded there was insufficient evidence to recommend ESWT for the treatment of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], a 2015 systematic review concluded that there is moderate evidence for the effectiveness of ESWT for the treatment of three lower limb tendinopathies: greater trochanteric pain syndrome, patellar tendinopathy, and Achilles tendinopathy&mdash;both mid-portion and insertional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Most studies included in the review of lower limb tendinopathies were case-control studies or lower quality controlled trials.</p><p>A number of experienced sports medicine physicians use ESWT for specific conditions - particularly plantar fasciitis and calcific tendinopathy of the supraspinatus or Achilles tendon.

A systematic review of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving patellar tendinopathy patients concluded, based upon limited evidence, that<strong> </strong>US can likely be excluded as a treatment due to marginal efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Another systematic review of RCTs of physical interventions for lateral elbow tendinopathy found insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of US as a lone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A single RCT comparing hyperthermia treatment to continuous US therapy in patients with either Achilles or patellar tendinopathy concluded that US treatment was inferior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1990773\"><span class=\"h2\">Laser therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low level laser therapy (LLLT, also known as &quot;cold laser&quot;) has been available for many years, but convincing evidence of its clinical efficacy is lacking. Despite the development of LLLT dosing guidelines for the treatment of tendinopathies by the World Association of Laser Therapy (WALT), a systematic review of controlled clinical trials reported inconsistent results with 12 studies showing some benefit while 13 reported inconclusive results or no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Studies varied in quality and in the laser dosages used. </p><p>A 2005 systematic review of studies of LLLT for patients with lateral epicondylalgia concluded that there was no clinically significant effect, either short or long-term, compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]<em>. </em>Several controlled trials in which patients were randomly assigned to treatment with LLLT or placebo laser reported that active laser treatment did not improve outcomes beyond those achieved with eccentric exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>].

Surgical consultation is reasonable if there is no improvement after six months of diligent physical therapy using a well-designed program in combination with adjunct medical treatments.</p><p>A variety of operative treatments have been advocated, depending upon the location of the tendinopathy and the preferences of the surgeon. Referring clinicians should carefully assess the risks and benefits of surgery. A systematic review concluded that the degree of success claimed in surgical studies of tendinopathy repair correlates inversely with the quality of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].</p><p>Most procedures involve incising the paratendon and removing adhesions, followed by debridement of macroscopically degenerate tissue. Sometimes longitudinal incisions are made in the tendon, with the goal of promoting a repair response. A similar strategy of longitudinal incision and debridement may be achieved arthroscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-99</a>]. Resection or drilling of the tendon's attachment points have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Such procedures necessarily entail a prolonged recovery due to the time needed for tendon healing.</p><p>Minimally invasive surgical procedures have been developed. The advantage of such procedures is that the tendon itself is not disturbed, so lengthy rehabilitation may be avoided. For the patellar tendon, an arthroscopic procedure may be performed by debriding the area of neovascularization on the posterior surface of the tendon until flow in the neovessels is no longer seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, a similar approach involves stripping or debriding the neurovascular supply of the anterior surface of the tendon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tendinopathies are chronic injuries that are slow to resolve, often requiring months for complete healing. Patience and careful adherence to an active rehabilitation program emphasizing heavy load exercise and implemented in progressive steps are the keys to successful treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Heavy load exercise'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinicians should take adequate time to explain to patients that a prolonged recovery (often three to four months) is likely and that they should not be discouraged by ongoing symptoms during rehabilitation. Indeed, symptoms often worsen during the initial stages of exercise therapy as loads placed on the tendon increase, and this does not necessarily mean the tendon injury is being aggravated. Rather, we have found that educating patients about the benefits of mechanical load in stimulating tissue repair is important to successful treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. </p><p>Maintaining a realistic view of rehabilitation is essential to patient engagement and treatment success. With challenging cases, careful oversight by a physiotherapist or exercise specialist is important to ensure that loads are heavy enough to promote healing but not so heavy as to exacerbate injury, impair function, cause excessive pain, or demoralize the patient.</p><p>The treatment steps outlined immediately below are based upon the algorithm developed for Achilles tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

It commonly results from overuse and occurs in workers and athletes. Most patients present after three months of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's history should elucidate the training or activity that led to the tendinopathy, and determine the level of function to which the patient aims to return. Validated functional assessment scores can help the clinician to grade symptoms and determine function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal biomechanics while performing common tasks (eg, running, jumping, walking, typing on a keyboard) often contribute to tendinopathy. Ideally, such potential abnormalities should be assessed by an expert and corrected wherever possible. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient history and assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Biomechanical modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that rehabilitation programs to treat chronic tendinopathy emphasize slow, progressive, heavy load exercise (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A suggested treatment approach is described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Heavy load exercise'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunct therapies may include stretching, tissue mobilization, ice or heat, and topical glyceryl trinitrate. A short course of antiinflammatory medication may be given at the onset of treatment. In chronic tendinopathy, glucocorticoids are potentially harmful and we suggest they be avoided (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>), with the exception of rotator cuff tendinopathy. During rehabilitation it is important to limit the volume and intensity of loads placed upon the injured tendon outside of the therapeutic exercise program. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Stretching'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ice or heat'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Joint mobilization and friction massage'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Antiinflammatory medications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Activity modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of alternative therapies for chronic tendinopathy are under investigation. These therapies, many of which involve intratendinous injections designed to stimulate a repair response, have not been compared in large clinical trials and clear proof of efficacy is lacking. Examples of alternative treatments include prolotherapy, sclerotherapy, autologous <span class=\"nowrap\">blood/platelet</span> rich plasma injection, and shock wave therapy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Investigational treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial treatment of chronic tendinopathy consists of nonsurgical management. However, it is reasonable to obtain surgical consultation if after six months of diligent physical therapy using a well-designed program in combination with adjunct medical treatments there has been no improvement in symptoms or function.
