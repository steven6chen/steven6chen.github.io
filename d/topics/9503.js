The 2008 European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases categorized LVNC as an &quot;unclassified&quot; cardiomyopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64479%7ECARD%2F74268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64479 graphicRef74268 \">table 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. LVNC was previously also called spongy myocardium or hypertrabeculation syndrome but these terms should not be used interchangeably with LVNC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>This review will focus on LVNC as an isolated disorder distinct from other clinical settings in which non-compacted myocardium may be seen in association with other cardiac and non-cardiac abnormalities. The classification of cardiomyopathies is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC; or &quot;non-compaction&quot;) is characterized by the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An altered myocardial wall with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses, resulting in thickened myocardium with two layers consisting of non-compacted myocardium and a thin compacted layer of myocardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57125\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57125 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuity between the left ventricular cavity and the deep intratrabecular recesses, which are filled with blood from the ventricular cavity without evidence of communication to the epicardial coronary artery system.</p><p/><p>As discussed below, criteria for the extent of noncompaction have been developed to help distinguish the trabeculation seen in LVNC from that seen in other forms of heart disease and in healthy individuals. However, criteria are evolving and there may be overlap between LVNC and other types of cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>By definition, isolated LVNC occurs in the absence of other cardiac or noncardiac congenital abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H628939569\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H433605363\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been suggested that left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) may be due to intrauterine arrest of compaction of the loose interwoven meshwork that makes up the fetal myocardial primordium. However, the term &quot;noncompaction&quot; may be a misnomer: Some authors have suggested that noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium results from abnormal persistence of the trabecular layer, rather than from noncompaction of the ventricular wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Pronounced hypertrabeculation may be the result of altered regulation in cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation during ventricular wall formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Prominent trabeculations as seen in LVNC may develop during adult life. Remodeling in response to LV loading conditions may explain the phenotypic characteristics of LVNC seen in some athletes and in some individuals who are pregnant or have hematologic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. Additionally, LVNC can occur as a transient phenomenon during myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] or mimic arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) in the general population is not known but its prevalence among patients undergoing echocardiography is estimated at 0.014 to 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. A review from Switzerland identified 34 cases within 15 years, which represented 0.014 percent of echocardiograms performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, this is probably an underestimate, since improved echocardiographic image quality and increasing awareness of LVNC will likely lead to enhanced recognition. Among heart failure patients, the prevalence of LVNC has been reported as 3 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>One difficulty in ascertaining the prevalence of LVNC is that morphologic criteria for LVNC are evolving and likely have varying specificity in different populations. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) can be either sporadic or familial. In various reports, 12 to 50 percent of those with LVNC had a family history of LVNC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. Other affected individuals can be detected by screening asymptomatic relatives of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Autosomal dominant inheritance is more common than X-linked inheritance or autosomal recessive inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Differentiation of genotypes is not possible on the basis of current phenotypic data. The yield of genetic testing in patients with LVNC is around 40 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>There is increasing recognition of considerable overlap in the genetic loci implicated in the major cardiomyopathies. Shared molecular etiology has been found for different cardiomyopathic phenotypes, including overlapping phenotypes between LVNC and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and between LVNC and apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Despite the genetic overlap between LVNC and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, LVNC co-occurs more commonly than hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with congenital heart disease or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Identified genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations have been reported in genes coding for sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, Z-line, and mitochondrial proteins. More than 10 genes in patients with LVNC have been described, including genes encoding LIM domain binding protein 3 (LDB3), &alpha;-dystrobrevin (DTNA), tafazzin (TAZ), lamin <span class=\"nowrap\">A/C</span> (LMNA), beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), alpha-cardiac actin (ACTC), cardiac troponin T (TNNT2), troponin I (TNN13), cardiac myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3), SCN5A, SNTA1, PRDM16, and tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Some genes associated with LVNC are associated with additional phenotypes (mainly dilated cardiomyopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. An exception is a mutation in the NOTCH pathway regulator mindbomb homolog 1 (MIB1) gene which segregated with autosomal dominant LVNC in two families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Fibrillin-1 gene mutations were identified in 10 percent of patients with LVNC and reduced left ventricular function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tafazzin</strong> &ndash; Mutations in the Tafazzin gene (aka G4.5 or TAZ) that result in truncation of tafazzin proteins lead to severe cardiolipin deficiency in the mitochondrial membrane and are responsible for Barth syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/12,24,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,24,28,29</a>]. Barth syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder with associated cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, and skeletal myopathy.

In a study with 63 unrelated subjects with LVNC, 18 mutations in several sarcomeric protein genes were found (cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-cardiac actin, cardiac myosin-binding protein C [MYBPC3], alpha-tropomyosin [TMP1], and troponin T2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

A systematic review of five observational studies with a total of 241 patients (with most patients not anticoagulated) found a mean thromboembolic event (largely cardioembolic stroke but included transient ischemic attack) rate of 8 percent during mean 39-month follow-up, with individual series rates varying from 0 to 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The highest thromboembolic rate of 24 percent during mean 44 months follow-up was reported in the earliest of the five studies in which anticoagulation use was not specified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Given the limited number of reported cases, risk factors for thromboembolism in patients with LVNC are uncertain. As an example, one retrospective case series found that 26 of 169 patients with LVNC had a stroke or embolic event during a variable period of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Eighteen of the events were felt to be cardioembolic, five atherosclerotic, and three of undetermined cause. Patients with stroke or embolism had higher rates of hypertension and higher CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2-</sub>VASc scores than patients without stroke or embolism. Left ventricular fractional shortening was similar in patients with and without a stroke or embolism event. Atrial fibrillation was nominally more frequent in patients with stroke or embolic event but there was no significant difference compared to patients without an event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H628940373\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, heart failure is a common presentation and hospitalization for heart failure is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H628940336\"><span class=\"h2\">Arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular and atrial arrhythmias occur in patients with LVNC. In a systematic review, 33 percent of patients had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and 5 percent had sustained ventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Atrial fibrillation was documented in 10 percent of patients. There are no data on the sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk of athletes with LVNC. LVNC has not been described in autopsy studies of athletes with SCD; however, LVNC could have been missed at autopsy or described as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1225258782\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram is usually abnormal (32 of 34 patients in the above report), but findings are nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The abnormalities that may be seen include left or right bundle branch block, fascicular block, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia. An association of LVNC with sinus bradycardia or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has been described in up to 18 percent of pediatric patients with LVNC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/12,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is diagnosed based upon clinical and morphologic criteria. However, since there is no gold standard for diagnosis, the sensitivity and specificity of morphologic criteria are uncertain. As discussed below, morphologic criteria for LVNC may be non-specific, particularly in athletes and black individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Diagnostic criteria for LVNC are evolving and require further standardization in relation to clinical end points that are relevant to management and prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H952277091\" class=\"local\">'Limitations'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of LVNC is usually established by transthoracic echocardiography. If echocardiography is indeterminate or technically suboptimal, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), computed tomography (CT), and left ventriculography are other imaging modalities that may be diagnostic. In an early case series from Switzerland describing 16 patients, the mean time from the onset of symptoms to the correct diagnosis was 3.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>While LVNC is an &ldquo;unclassified&rdquo; cardiomyopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64479 \">table 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74268 \">table 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], most patients with LVNC also have features of other morphologic categories of cardiomyopathy, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy, occasionally hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (especially the apical variant), or rarely restrictive cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/24,31,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31,48,49</a>].

No study has proven the utility of Holter monitoring. However, in one study of LVNC patients &lt;age 21 years old and EF of &ge;45 percent, Holter monitoring revealed frequent ventricular arrhythmias in 6 percent and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Since patients with LVNC are at risk for SCA, some have proposed developing an LVNC risk model to determine likelihood of benefit from an ICD, similar to the HCM Risk-SCD model calculator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. One potential component of such a model might be a fragmented QRS complex. In a study of 88 patients with LVNC, the presence of fragmented QRS complex was found to be an independent predictor of arrhythmic events (hazard ratio 3.850, 95% CI 1.062-9.947) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 2.719, 95% CI 1.494-9.262) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1927152180\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with LVNC who have left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;50 percent, ECG abnormalities, arrhythmia, symptomatic presentation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a positive family history of cardiomyopathy should be counseled to refrain from competitive endurance sports or weight lifting (similar to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392475678\"><span class=\"h2\">Family counseling and screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with LVNC should receive family and genetic counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-left-ventricular-noncompaction/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various echocardiographic criteria for diagnosis of LVNC have been proposed. The Jenni criteria include the presence of a maximum ratio of noncompacted to compacted myocardium &gt;2:1 at end-systole in the parasternal short-axis view. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with LVNC with systolic heart failure, we use standard medical therapy for heart failure due to systolic dysfunction.
