Massive fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH), however, can result in serious sequelae. This topic will review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of pregnancies complicated by massive FMH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No universally accepted threshold defines the volume of fetal erythrocytes in the maternal circulation that constitutes a massive FMH; volumes of 10 to 150 mL have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. To put this in context, fetoplacental blood volume is approximately 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> estimated fetal weight prior to 32 weeks of gestation and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> after 32 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A better approach for assessing the magnitude of FMH is to estimate the percentage of the fetal blood volume represented by the FMH. Looked at in this way, a FMH of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> which represents 20 percent of the fetoplacental blood volume, is considered massive because it has been associated with significant <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> morbidity or mortality. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Experiments in sheep show that the rapidity of fetal blood loss is an additional major factor affecting morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Massive FMH is more likely to be fatal if blood loss occurs over minutes rather than hours, days, or weeks. Although a critical prognostic factor, the rate of fetomaternal bleeding in human pregnancies is generally impossible to assess clinically, unless the fetus is hydropic, which suggests chronic anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FMH &gt;20 to 30 mL at delivery is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 200 to 300 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. FMH &gt;80 mL and &gt;150 mL is estimated to occur in 1 in 1000 deliveries and 1 in 5000 deliveries, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>These estimates of massive FMH were derived from two large series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series consisted of 48 patients with FMH &gt;20 mL identified among 45,180 deliveries over an eight-year period at two hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Sixty percent of the cases were identified because of routine postpartum Kleihauer-Betke testing of Rh(D)-negative women (n = 6777 deliveries); the other 40 percent were identified by Kleihauer-Betke testing in women in whom FMH was suspected because of maternal abdominal trauma, fetal distress, fetal death, or neonatal pallor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the routinely tested Rh(D)-negative population, the incidence of FMH &gt;20 mL was 4.6 per 1000 live births (ie, 1 in 217 live births); for FMH &gt;30 mL, the incidence was 3.8 per 1000 live births (1 in 263); and for FMH &gt;80 mL, the incidence was 0.7 per 1000 live births (1 in 1429).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series, approximately 31,000 Rh(D)-negative women underwent Kleihauer-Betke screening at delivery&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H784295544\" class=\"local\">'Kleihauer-Betke'</a> below.) The incidence of FMH &gt;80 mL was 1 in 1146 deliveries, and the incidence of FMH &gt;150 mL was 1 in 2813 deliveries (or 0.9 and 0.2 per 1000 deliveries, respectively).</p><p/><p>A third series of approximately 220,000 births in 20 hospitals over seven years identified neonates with an initial hematocrit &lt;30 percent or hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and laboratory evidence of FMH on the day of birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These neonates represented 1 in 9160 live births and had FMHs of 92 to 370 mL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726126989\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for large FMH include multiple gestation, nuchal cord, and low birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726127021\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of FMH is unclear. A histological study of placentas observed that parenchymal and retroplacental hemorrhage, intervillous thrombi, and infarction increased the likelihood that fetal cells would be found in the maternal circulation, and the extent of the abnormality correlated with the size of the hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, many questions remain about the origin of these lesions and the factors that determine the number and volume of bleeding episodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726127059\"><span class=\"h1\">SPONTANEOUS VERSUS TRAUMATIC FMH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Massive FMH may occur spontaneously or result from trauma. Spontaneous FMH is defined as hemorrhage with no antecedent history of trauma and no <span class=\"nowrap\">clinical/histopathological</span> evidence of abruption. One of the largest series of FMHs &gt;50 mL (n = 134 cases) reported that a cause could not be determined in 82 percent, which suggests that most massive FMHs are spontaneous [13].</p><p>Traumatic injuries to the placental interface are typically caused by invasive diagnostic procedures (eg, amniocentesis, chorion villus biopsy, fetoscopy) or blunt abdominal trauma (eg, external cephalic version, motor vehicle crash, fall).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Massive FMH occurs in the second or third trimester and can be either acute or chronic (ie, intermittent recurrent FMH). The mother is usually asymptomatic, although symptoms suggestive of a transfusion reaction (eg, fever, chills, nausea) have been described in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Decreased or absent fetal movement is the most common antepartum presentation (present in 27 and 54 percent of cases in two series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]). Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is typically performed for fetal assessment in this setting and may show a sinusoidal FHR pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61189\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef61189 \">waveform 1</a>), recurrent late decelerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/9,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,16</a>], or fetal tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ultrasound assessment may yield a low biophysical profile score. Over time, chronic FMH can lead to persistent fetal anemia and hydrops fetalis. The triad of decreased fetal movement, sinusoidal FHR pattern, and hydrops fetalis are late signs of massive chronic FMH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In some cases, however, a massive FMH may not be suspected until fetal demise has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>After delivery, FMH may be suspected because of neonatal anemia. Increased production of red blood cell precursors and increased circulating reticulocyte counts suggest that FMH occurred one to two days prior to birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>These relationships were illustrated in a review of 120 cases of FMH &gt;50 mL noted before and after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The following presentations were described: anemia at birth (35.2 percent of cases), decreased or absent fetal movement (26.8 percent), unexpected stillbirth (12.5 percent), hydrops (7.5 percent), fetal distress (6.6 percent), intrauterine growth restriction (3.3 percent), and one or two cases each of sinusoidal FHR pattern, fetal atrial fibrillation, and maternal transfusion reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO TEST FOR FMH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for FMH is reasonable in the following clinical settings, when unexplained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal demise or stillbirth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinusoidal fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonimmune hydrops fetalis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal anemia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal demise or stillbirth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for FMH should be part of the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained intrauterine fetal demise after 20 weeks of gestation and stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Spontaneous massive FMH accounts for 1.6 to 13.8 percent of these events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>]. Causation is supported by FMH &gt;20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> and especially &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of estimated fetal weight. In one series of 32 cases, the mean total blood volume loss was 67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> (55 percent); FMH exceeded 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> (30 percent of blood volume) in 79 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) with Doppler ultrasound was measured in all 32 cases. A value of &gt;1.5 MoM was noted in <span class=\"nowrap\">31/32</span> cases; a value of &gt;2 MoM was noted in <span class=\"nowrap\">14/32</span>. Evaluation for FMH should be part of the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained fetal anemia.

Severe cases may present with circulatory collapse. In one study, an educational effort in neonatology resulted in an eightfold increased rate of detection of FMH as the cause of neonatal anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Evaluation for FMH is indicated when a sinusoidal fetal heart rate (FHR) or nonimmune hydrops is identified. Some clinicians test for FMH in all cases of persistently decreased fetal activity, but the utility of this approach is unclear if the initial fetal evaluation is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Decreased fetal movement: Diagnosis, evaluation, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal abdominal trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus as to whether all pregnant women who have experienced abdominal trauma should undergo routine testing for FMH. In one study of 151 pregnant women in the third trimester with varying severity of trauma, 2.6 percent had a positive test for FMH, and none of these women had clinical evidence of an abruption or a nonreassuring FHR pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This rate was not significantly different from the rate in controls (low-risk gravid women at the time of routine screening for gestational diabetes). However, others have reported FMH rates four- to fivefold higher than the background rate after maternal trauma, especially in women with physical evidence of trauma, an anterior placenta, or symptoms (eg, uterine tenderness, FHR abnormalities, contractions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>].</p><p>We believe that testing in trauma patients may be cost effective in symptomatic Rh(D)-negative women over 20 weeks of gestation since a massive FMH, although rare, would necessitate administration of more than the standard dose of 300 micrograms of anti-D-immune globulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/28,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32</a>]. The value of this information in Rh(D)-positive women with reassuring fetal testing is unproven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784295482\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two maternal assays are available for detecting FMH: the Kleihauer-Betke test and flow cytometry. Both are based on identification of hemoglobin F, the predominant fetal hemoglobin. However, adult red blood cells may also contain hemoglobin F (known as F cells). F cells can cause the assay to overestimate the volume of FMH in maternal blood. This is especially important in some hematological disorders, such as sickle cell disease, which can be associated with persistence of hemoglobin F in a large number of cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both assays measure the volume of fetal blood in the maternal circulation at a point in time and thus do not necessarily indicate the volume of blood loss over time, if bleeding was chronic or occurred on multiple occasions. The lifespan of the fetal erythrocyte is 100 days, but is much shorter in the maternal circulation if there is ABO or Rhesus incompatibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784295544\"><span class=\"h2\">Kleihauer-Betke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Kleihauer-Betke test is the main diagnostic test for detection and quantitation of FMH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Red blood cells from the maternal circulation are fixed to a slide that is exposed to an acidic pH solution. Adult red blood cells become &quot;ghost&quot; cells since hemoglobin A is soluble and eluted across membrane defects at a low pH. Fetal red blood cells remain pink because hemoglobin F is stable at pHs in this range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71762\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71762 \">picture 1</a>). A laboratory technician looking through a microscope counts a minimum of 2000 cells (typically 8 to 10 fields at 250X magnification) and reports the result as the percentage of fetal red blood cells in the total sample. The volume of fetal whole blood (mL) in the maternal circulation is: (% fetal cells) X (maternal hematocrit [%] divided by fetal hematocrit [%]) X (maternal blood volume mL).</p><p>In the usual clinical scenario, the maternal blood volume and the fetal hematocrit are not known, and most laboratories do not request the maternal hematocrit for the calculation. The maternal blood volume is often assumed to be 5000 mL, yielding the following formula to calculate the volume of fetal whole blood (mL) in the maternal circulation: (% fetal cells) X 5000 mL. Thus, if the Kleihauer-Betke result is 0.1 percent, the FMH calculation is (0.001 X 5000) = 5 mL of fetal whole blood.</p><p>Since the maternal blood volume is not measured in either of these calculations, the clinician should consider the volume of FMH an estimate. Patients who are smaller or larger than the mean would be expected to have circulating blood volumes smaller or larger than 5000 mLs. The same Kleihauer-Betke test result will overestimate the volume of FMH in a smaller woman and underestimate the volume of FMH in a larger woman. Consultation with the blood bank can be helpful.</p><p>Variations in the formula for estimating FMH and in the assumptions used in the calculating of FMH have been published. A comparison of these formulas when fetal cells comprised 3 percent of cells in the maternal sample yielded FMH estimates ranging from 108 to 162 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784295638\"><span class=\"h2\">Flow cytometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flow cytometry is another assay for detecting and quantitating FMH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A monoclonal antibody to hemoglobin F is conjugated to a fluorochrome and used to detect fetal hemoglobin in permeabilized cells as they pass through the channel of a flow cytometer. Comparative analysis of flow cytometry and the Kleihauer-Betke test has shown that flow cytometry is more accurate, more reproducible, and less labor intensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. For this reason, many laboratories are converting to this assay for detecting FMH.</p><p>Calculation of FMH using flow cytometry is subject to the same limitations as the Kleihauer-Betke test: inability to measure the maternal blood volume and interference with persistence of fetal hemoglobin in adult red blood cells (F cells). Dual-parameter flow cytometry can alleviate the issue with maternal F cells noted in such disease states as hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias. A second antibody is used to detect unique erythrocyte antigens to fetal red cells such as carbonic anhydrase. Only cells that are positive for both hemoglobin F and carbonic anhydrase are gated for a positive response. The flow cytometry equation for calculating the volume (mL) of fetal packed red blood cells in the maternal circulation is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]: (% positive events) X (1800 mL) divided by 100 X <span class=\"nowrap\">(122/100),</span> where 1800 mL is the estimated average maternal red blood cell volume based on a maternal hematocrit of 36 percent and <span class=\"nowrap\">122/100</span> is an adjustment to take into account that fetal red blood cells are usually approximately 20 percent larger than adult red blood cells. Multiplying this value by a factor of two yields the volume (mL) of whole blood FMH since the normal fetal hematocrit is approximately 50 percent. As an example, a flow cytometry result of 0.1 percent positive events would result in the following calculation: (0.1 X <span class=\"nowrap\">1800)/100</span> = 1.8 X <span class=\"nowrap\">122/100</span> = 2.2 mL X 2 = 4.4 mL whole blood volume fetomaternal hemorrhage.</p><p>Some experts have recommended that the estimated FMH should be calculated as a percentage of the estimated total fetal blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.) The latter can be calculated by multiplying the estimated fetal weight in kilograms (based on ultrasound parameters) by 85 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> which is the fetal blood volume per kilogram fetal weight. The percent of fetal blood volume represented by the FMH would be (whole blood volume of FMH in mL) divided by (estimated fetal weight in kg) X (85 <span class=\"nowrap\">ml/kg)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF SPONTANEOUS FMH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nonreassuring fetal testing typically require urgent delivery, regardless of the cause. Our approach to suspected spontaneous FMH with reassuring fetal testing is illustrated by the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73675\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73675 \">algorithm 1</a>). There are no high-quality data to guide decision making in these pregnancies. Management is based on fetal assessment and gestational age, taking into account the morbidity of prematurity, the morbidity of in utero therapy, and the uncertain clinical course of expectant management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Massive hemorrhage/moderate to severe anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For pregnancies &ge;32 weeks of gestation with FMH &ge;20 percent of the fetal blood volume or middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) &ge;1.5 multiples of the median (MoMs), we suggest immediate cesarean delivery, with blood available for prompt neonatal transfusion. The morbidity of prematurity at this gestational age is probably less than the risks of in utero transfusion or recurrent FMH during expectant management.</p><p>For pregnancies &lt;32 weeks of gestation, especially with severe anemia (eg, hydrops fetalis), an intravascular intrauterine transfusion (IVT) of donor red blood cells can acutely correct fetal anemia and is probably associated with lower morbidity and mortality than preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Because of the risk for preterm delivery, a course of antenatal corticosteroids is administered to enhance fetal lung maturity and a course of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> is administered for fetal neuroprotection in pregnancies &ge;23 weeks.

Diagnosis of ongoing FMH is challenging after transfusion because the transfused cells contain adult hemoglobin and thus are not detected by Kleihauer-Betke or flow cytometry tests. Continued hospitalization with daily MCA-PSV Doppler ultrasound and fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is reasonable until intrauterine transfusions are no longer deemed necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p>A review of chronic massive FMH with fetal hydrops treated by IVT reported overall perinatal survival in 12 of 13 cases (92 percent survival) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Two fetuses were delivered the same day as IVT and two others delivered within one week. In five cases, resolution of the fetal anemia and significant prolongation of the pregnancy occurred after one IVT. In the other cases, recurrent fetal anemia occurred several days after the initial IVT, and up to five procedures were performed. The mean prolongation of the pregnancy was six weeks (range: 0 days to 16.6 weeks). Although these results are promising, the series is small, and other clinicians have reported unsuccessful outcomes, including perinatal death and long-term disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

We use &ge;20 percent of the fetoplacental blood volume because this threshold has been associated with significant <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> morbidity or mortality. Absolute thresholds of 10 to 150 mL have also been proposed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive FMH may occur spontaneously or result from trauma. (See <a href=\"#H726127059\" class=\"local\">'Spontaneous versus traumatic FMH'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetomaternal bleeding may be acute or chronic. The mother is usually asymptomatic, but may have symptoms suggestive of a transfusion reaction (eg, fever, chills, nausea). Fetal findings associated with massive FMH include absent or persistently decreased movement (most common finding), heart rate abnormality (eg, sinusoidal fetal heart rate [FHR] pattern, recurrent late decelerations, tachycardia), low biophysical profile score, hydrops fetalis, and death. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest testing for FMH in pregnant women who present with unexplained sinusoidal FHR pattern, hydrops fetalis, or fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">demise/stillbirth</span> after 20 weeks of gestation. The utility of this test is unclear in women with persistently decreased fetal activity and a normal FHR pattern and fetal ultrasound examination. Evaluation for FMH should also be part of the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained neonatal anemia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'When to test for FMH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When fetal anemia is suspected, the peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) should be determined with Doppler ultrasound. A MCA-PSV value &ge;1.5 multiples of the median (MoM) strongly correlates with moderate to severe fetal anemia. Evaluation for FMH is part of the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained fetal anemia. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal fetal heart rate or hydrops fetalis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either a Kleihauer-Betke stain or flow cytometry can be used for diagnosing FMH. The volume of fetal blood loss should be calculated as a percentage of the estimated fetoplacental blood volume. (See <a href=\"#H784295482\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with nonreassuring fetal testing typically require urgent delivery, regardless of the cause.

Intrauterine transfusion can correct severe fetal anemia and thus avoid risks of very preterm birth. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Massive hemorrhage/moderate to severe anemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small FMHs with only mild fetal anemia can be followed expectantly.
