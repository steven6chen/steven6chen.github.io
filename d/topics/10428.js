Occasionally, hypervolemia develops despite these adjustments, however, and must be evaluated.</p><p>This topic reviews factors that contribute to hypervolemia in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Ultrafiltration is the passage of fluid across a semipermeable membrane in response to a driving pressure (ie, hydrostatic, oncotic, or osmotic pressure).</p><p>Water moves from peritoneal capillary blood to peritoneal dialysate fluid via intercellular and transcellular pores in the peritoneal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Whereas both water and solute are able cross the intercellular pores, the transcellular pore (also called the aquaporin channel) allows only water transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Fluid crosses all the pores in response to an osmotic gradient that is generated by dextrose (or occasionally the dextrose polymer, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>), which is present in peritoneal dialysate. Fluid movement is also influenced by oncotic gradients, generated by albumin and other proteins in blood.</p><p>Ultrafiltration is typically increased by increasing the concentration of peritoneal dialysate dextrose. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> are available with variable amounts of dextrose (ie, 1.5, 2.5, and 4.25 percent). Patients are instructed to increase the dialysate dextrose if their body weight goes above a specific target weight, reflecting hypervolemia, or if signs of hypervolemia (ie, edema, hypertension) develop. (See <a href=\"#H3811342091\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERVOLEMIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672835154\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypervolemia is common in peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In a study of 639 individuals who had been on peritoneal dialysis for over two years, fluid overload was present in more than 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Causes may be unrelated to the dialysis procedure (such as loss of residual renal function or excessive sodium and water intake) or related to the dialysis procedure. In addition, a new cardiovascular event or worsening of underlying heart disease may cause features of hypervolemia, such as pedal or pulmonary edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H808510426\"><span class=\"h3\">Unrelated to dialysis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Loss of residual renal function &#9472;</strong> Patients who initiate peritoneal dialysis usually have some residual kidney function that contributes to fluid clearance. Residual renal function tends to declines over time in most patients. This reduces net fluid clearance unless the dialysis prescription is adjusted to provide more ultrafiltration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excessive dietary sodium and water intake </strong>&#9472; We generally restrict sodium to &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span>. We do not restrict fluids, at least initially, if the patients has residual renal function. However, many individuals will start to require fluid restriction as residual renal function declines. Excessive sodium and fluid intake in such patients will cause hypervolemia. (See <a href=\"#H868256838\" class=\"local\">'Additional preventive measures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2244447297\"><span class=\"h3\">Related to dialysis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lack of compliance </strong>&ndash; Patients occasionally skip exchanges, shorten the daytime dwell, or lengthen the nighttime dwell. Depending on the rate of solute transport, shortening the daytime dwell may not allow sufficient time for ultrafiltration. Lengthening the nighttime can cause reabsorption of ultrafiltered fluid into the blood or by lymphatics. Some patients may use the incorrect solution during the overnight dwells or fail to adjust the dialysate dextrose concentration based on body weight (which results in an insufficient osmotic stimulus for ultrafiltration). Some patients shorten the drain time and do not wait for complete drain before instilling new fluid. This results in the accumulation of fluid and eventual reabsorption of fluid into blood and lymphatics or dilutes the dextrose concentration of the subsequent dwell.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incorrect dialysis prescription for transport type </strong>&ndash; The dialysis prescription is optimized according to specific membrane transport characteristics for each individual patient. These transport characteristics are defined by a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) that is performed shortly after the start of dialysis. If the transport characteristics change, the prescription may need to be adjusted accordingly. As an example, &quot;fast or high transporters&quot; are characterized by the more rapid movement of dextrose across the membrane. Since dextrose provides a major osmotic stimulus for water movement, such patients will ultrafilter more quickly and are often better served by a shorter dwell (ie, the time that peritoneal fluid is in the peritoneal cavity). By contrast &quot;slow or low transporters&quot; are characterized by slower transport of solute and often require a longer dwell to achieve complete ultrafiltration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-equilibration-test#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal equilibration test&quot;, section on 'Selection of peritoneal dialysis regimen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoalbuminemia and hyperglycemia </strong>&ndash; Hypoalbuminemia from poor nutrition, nephrotic syndrome, or liver disease may decrease the oncotic pressure gradient that drives water from the blood into dialysate. It is difficult to remove fluid in such patients; intravascular volume depletion may be precipitated if all excess interstitial volume is removed with aggressive ultrafiltration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our experience, hypervolemia from hypoalbuminemia usually does not occur unless the serum albumin concentration is less than 2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic hyperglycemia may reduce the osmotic pressure gradient between blood and dialysate that drives ultrafiltration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanical problems causing collection of dialysate </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Anything that causes a chronic (and usually unrecognized) collection of dialysis fluid may result in hypervolemia. Mechanical catheter problems, such as retroperitoneal leaks or even just malpositioning, often allow normal infusion of dialysis fluid but insufficient draining of dialysate plus ultrafiltrate. This causes a fluid collection that gets absorbed over time into capillaries and lymphatics. A common example is a catheter leak into retroperitoneal or abdominal wall space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Incomplete draining of peritoneal fluid may also result in a large residual volume in the peritoneal cavity that dilutes the dextrose concentration of the next dwell. This decreases the osmotic stimulus for ultrafiltration. As an example, the 4.25 percent dextrose solution that is instilled ends up with less than 4.25 percent dextrose, and the 7.5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a> ends up containing less than 7.5 percent icodextrin. Depending on the amount of dilution, this could affect the ability to remove fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrafiltration failure </strong>&ndash; With true ultrafiltration failure (or &quot;membrane failure&quot;), there is insufficient fluid transport across the peritoneal membrane despite optimal conditions (ie, compliance, correct prescription, adequate albumin, etc).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ultrafiltration failure can occur at any stage of peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The reported incidence is between 10 and 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, this is probably an overestimate since apparent ultrafiltration failure is often just a mismatch of dwell time to transport type that can be addressed by adjusting the dialysis prescription. True ultrafiltration failure often results in transfer to hemodialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The major risk factor for ultrafiltration failure is repeated episodes of peritonitis. Other reported risk factors include peritoneal dialysis of greater than two years duration (even in the absence of peritonitis), increased exposure to high-concentration dialysate glucose, and possibly diabetes mellitus and the use of beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/10,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are three types of true ultrafiltration failure:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type 1 &ndash;</strong> There is very rapid membrane solute transport (ie, &quot;rapid or high transporters&quot;), resulting in rapid equilibration and dissipation of the osmotic gradient. Type 1 is the most common type of ultrafiltration failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and may be transient during an acute episode of peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] or sustained following repeated episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type 2</strong> &ndash; There is decreased function of aquaporins, resulting in isolated decrease in water transport.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type 3</strong> &ndash; There is loss of effective peritoneal membrane surface area due to sclerosis or adhesions, resulting in decreased permeability to both solute and fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, an increase in the rate of absorption of fluids from the peritoneal cavity via lymphatic vessels and into local tissue presents in a similar fashion to true membrane failure and is referred to as type 4 ultrafiltration failure, although peritoneal membrane function is intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In such cases, even with adequate ultrafiltration of fluid from capillaries into dialysate, the ultrafiltered fluid is absorbed instead of draining via the peritoneal catheter to the outside. Normally, the rate of reabsorption is approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Hypervolemia may result when absorption rates are greater than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Increased absorption may be related to excessive intraperitoneal pressure, which occasionally occurs when large instilled volumes are used in small patients; reducing instilled volume often resolves the problem in such cases. It appears to be unrelated to the duration of peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3893669620\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important measure to prevent hypervolemia is to establish and maintain an accurate target weight. It is also important to monitor urine volume and the volume of fluid removed with dialysis so that the dialysis prescription may be modified before significant hypervolemia develops. All measures are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163672592\"><span class=\"h3\">Establish target weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The target weight is defined as the weight at which the patient does not have hypertension or other evidence of fluid overload (eg, pulmonary or pedal edema, ascites) and does not have evidence of volume depletion (orthostatic symptoms, tachycardia). The initial target weight is established by trial and error during peritoneal dialysis training.</p><p>An accurate target weight is important because, unlike hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis is a home therapy that is carried out by patients who are typically examined by their clinician only once per month. Thus, the clinical judgment that determines targets of fluid removal is rendered by the patient. At most centers, patients are trained to adjust the dextrose concentration of the peritoneal dialysis fluid based on their current weight (in comparison to the defined target weight), blood pressure, or physical examination evidence of lower-extremity edema.</p><p>The target weight tends to change over time. Patients may gain or lose actual body mass (eg, muscle mass, fat mass) while on dialysis. Underestimates or overestimates in target weight will result in volume depletion or hypervolemia, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3811342091\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are generally evaluated at least monthly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We routinely re-evaluate target weight based on clinical exam, dietary history, and by any changes in cardiovascular status. If a patient develops pedal and pulmonary edema at the prescribed target weight, he or she has likely lost body mass, and the target weight needs to be set lower to better approximate euvolemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We review the ultrafiltration volumes achieved and the percent dextrose used with each exchange in order to monitor the ultrafiltration capability of the membrane and the total fluid volume removed daily with dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), the ultrafiltration volumes are available on the automated cycler; otherwise, we rely on a patient-kept log.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We measure a 24-hour urine volume to detect any decreases in urine volume that could contribute to a decrease in net fluid removal. If a decline is detected, we adjust the dialysis prescription to provide more ultrafiltration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis#H1128864248\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Fluid balance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We review medication use to make sure the patient has not been started on nephrotoxic medications in order to preserve residual renal function. Clinicians who are unaware of the importance of this may prescribe such medications since the patient is already on dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most clinicians perform the PET shortly after the initiation of dialysis and then only if there is evidence of change in ultrafiltration based on the dialysis logs. This approach is consistent with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In some centers, the PET is routinely performed yearly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H868256838\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional preventive measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following measures may also help to prevent hypervolemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use diuretics in all patients with residual renal function, even if they do not have evidence of hypervolemia. The more urine volume a patient has, the less <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> needs to rely on peritoneal dialysis ultrafiltration. Typically, patients are already on loop diuretics (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>) when they initiate peritoneal dialysis. We continue the same dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We try to preserve residual renal function. Specific measures include avoidance of nephrotoxic agents and volume depletion, rigorous control of blood pressure, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the setting of proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis#H1128865005\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Preservation of residual renal function'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We provide dietary counseling to all patients. This is important in preventing hypervolemia but is frequently overlooked. We typically restrict sodium to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or use a no-added-salt diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. We do not restrict fluid unless the patient has no residual renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We encourage compliance in maintaining the peritoneal dialysis regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We optimize serum glucose control. As noted above, patients with consistently elevated blood glucose lose the osmotic gradient between the blood and peritoneal fluid that drives ultrafiltration. We review HbA1C levels at least twice a year if this has not obtained by the patient's other clinicians. If the HbA1C is elevated, the pharmacologic therapies may need to be reviewed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperglycemia-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-and-pre-dialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-or-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We try to limit the use of 4.25 percent exchanges in such patients since the higher glucose concentration is more likely to be associated with hyperglycemia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Icodextrin</a> may be used instead of 4.25 percent dextrose for one dwell (usually the longest dwell of the day). Icodextrin is slowly absorbed and allows for better ultrafiltration compared with dextrose. What little is absorbed is eventually metabolized to glucose such that the caloric load is approximately equivalent to that of a 2.25 percent dextrose dialysate. (See <a href=\"#H1833481268\" class=\"local\">'Icodextrin dialysate'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3565966951\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We follow a stepwise and streamlined evaluation for the cause of hypervolemia. A targeted history and physical, a &quot;fill and drain test,&quot; and imaging are to identify or exclude the following causes of hypervolemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New or worsening heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive sodium and water intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inaccurate target weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncompliance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased residual function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical problem causing fluid accumulation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be specifically asked about the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptoms of heart disease </strong>&ndash; New or worsening heart diseases should be further evaluated as necessary with an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiographic, or radiographic studies. Changes in cardiac output could be due to a change in a known arrhythmia or onset of a new arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dietary history &ndash;</strong> The patient should be asked about loss of appetite or decreased oral intake. Any loss of body mass could cause the target weight to be artificially high and inaccurate. Readjusting the target weight down effectively treats hypervolemia in such cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The patient should also be asked about sodium and water intake, particularly if they do not have residual renal function. (See <a href=\"#H2006544781\" class=\"local\">'Sodium and fluid restriction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compliance with dialysis prescription &ndash;</strong> Patients should be asked about compliance, specifically including the duration of the overnight dwell, duration of the drain for each exchange, and whether the dialysate dextrose concentration is being adjusted based on body weight, blood pressure, or evidence of hypervolemia such as pedal edema, as instructed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the physical exam to identify mechanical problems, including hernias or catheter leaks, that could cause the accumulation of fluid.</p><p>We examine the pericatheter, genital, inguinal, and femoral areas for hernias. We look for evidence of retained fluid that may be unilateral or localized to certain areas, particularly the pleural space, abdominal wall, inguinal areas, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genitalia. Any evidence of fluid accumulation should be further evaluated with imaging. (See <a href=\"#H2925824233\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> below.)</p><p>We examine the exit site for the presence of fluid that is dextrose positive on dipstick, which suggests a peritoneal leak (since peritoneal fluid contains dextrose). Not all peritoneal leaks result in leakage of fluid around the exit site, however, and a retroperitoneal or abdominal wall leak could still be present in the absence of dextrose-positive fluid at the exit site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29626964\"><span class=\"h3\">Dialysis data and urine volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As for all routine monthly visits, we review manual logs or treatment data from automated cyclers. It is particularly important to determine the drain volume following the long daytime dwell in patients on the automated cycler since reabsorption of fluid is common. We also note the number and type of alarms with the automated cycler since they indicate changes in fluid volume or flow rate that could indicate incomplete draining.</p><p>We measure the urine volume to make sure it has not substantially decreased. We review the dialysis supplies to make sure of compliance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Fill and drain test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who do not have an obvious explanation for their hypervolemia after history and physical, we perform a &quot;fill and drain&quot; test under direct visualization to exclude a mechanical problem, such as a catheter leak, malpositioning, or obstruction to outflow that could cause the accumulation of fluid inside the body.</p><p>We observe the rate of inflow or outflow since a decreased rate suggests a partial obstruction. We observe for fibrin clots that could cause intermittent obstruction. Positional changes in fluid outflow suggest catheter malpositioning.</p><p>The drain volume should be at least equal to the fill volume. A drain volume less than that suggests the accumulation of fluid inside the body.</p><p>A detailed discussion of the different mechanical and anatomical abnormalities associated with peritoneal dialysis catheters is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninfectious complications of peritoneal dialysis catheters&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Any evidence of inadequate drainage should be investigated with radiographic studies. (See <a href=\"#H2925824233\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2925824233\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We obtain a flat plate and lateral film of the abdomen to determine catheter placement and positioning. The flat plate may also show constipation, even if denied by the patient. Constipation may cause failure to drain if it causes the tip of the catheter to be located in a &quot;pseudo&quot; pocket in the pelvis created by the rigid sigmoid. The lateral film is done to exclude a rotation or kink in the subcutaneous portion of the catheter.</p><p>If the flat plate and lateral films are nonrevealing, either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <strong>without contrast</strong> or a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intraperitoneal contrast is performed to detect a catheter leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypervolemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>MRI is the preferred study since it can distinguish peritoneal fluid accumulation from the surrounding tissue or interstitial fluid even without contrast.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a CT is used to identify a possible leak, a baseline CT of the abdomen and pelvis with no intraperitoneal fluid or contrast is first obtained. We then add 100 to 200 mL of nonionic contrast to a 2 L dialysate bag, which is instilled in the peritoneum.

At our center, to prevent adhesion formation, we typically instill 100 to 200 mL of 1.36 percent dialysate containing 3500 international units of heparin (which is allowed to dwell for 30 minutes and then drained) once or twice a week.

Ultrafiltration is the passage of a fluid across a semipermeable membrane in response to a driving pressure (ie, hydrostatic, oncotic, or osmotic pressure). Ultrafiltration can be increased by increasing the amount of peritoneal dialysate dextrose or other solute such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>.
