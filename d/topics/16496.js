In addition, 24 percent of SCA victims had one or more events (average number 2.6) of syncope or unexplained seizure-like activity that remained undiagnosed before SCA. In approximately 40 percent of cases, the symptom was brought to the attention of the child's clinician, and 27 percent of families reported a history of a family member who had suffered SCD before 50 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H780323955\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are obtained in children for a variety of reasons (evaluation of concerning symptoms, screening prior to starting certain medications, screening prior to sports participation). A high-quality 12-lead ECG, with standard paper speed and amplitudes, is necessary to make accurate measurements and avoid artifact in ECG interpretation. It is important to recognize potentially pathologic ECG findings and distinguish them from findings that are generally benign. Though the distinction can often be made by the noncardiologist, consultation with a pediatric cardiologist may be warranted.</p><p>ECG findings that warrant further evaluation (which, depending on the finding, may include review of the history and physical examination, echocardiography, ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise stress test, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> or genetic testing) include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Prominent/abnormal</span> Q waves &ndash; Q waves &gt;3 mm in depth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &gt;40 ms duration in at least two leads are characteristic findings for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F110278\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef110278 \">waveform 1</a>).

These nonspecific symptoms are frequently thought to be due to other conditions, which can be differentiated from the underlying cardiac disorder by clinical manifestations or tests.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Syncope</strong> &ndash; In children, the most likely cause of syncope or presyncope is neurocardiogenic syncope, also referred to as vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope is often triggered by pain or fear and is commonly accompanied by premonitory symptoms before collapse, such as lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea, and tunnel vision. In contrast, syncope associated with SCA generally occurs without warning or during exercise, or is associated with chest pain or palpitations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other less common causes of pediatric syncope include migraine headaches, seizures, and brain tumors. These conditions, like vasovagal syncope, are associated with prodromal symptoms, or in the case of seizures, a postictal state and incontinence. The causes and evaluation of pediatric syncope are discussed separately.

The myoclonic movements due to cerebral hypoxia in patients with SCA generally occur after the initial collapse, whereas in individuals with seizures, body movements begin concurrently with loss of postural tone and collapse. However, this clinical distinction may be difficult to ascertain. As a result, we suggest that the evaluation of children with seizure-like activity include electrocardiography (ECG) and possibly an echocardiogram.

In contrast, cardiac disease is an uncommon cause of chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Chest pain is almost never present with patients with primary electrical disorders, but may be present in patients with cardiomyopathies or abnormalities of the coronary arteries or aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Cardiac disease is more likely if chest pain occurs during exertion, is recurrent, or is accompanied by palpitations or syncope. The approach to evaluation of chest pain in children is discussed separately.

Patients with cardiomyopathy, structural heart disease, and arrhythmia may present with respiratory difficulties, particularly dyspnea on exertion. Exercise-induced bronchospasm associated with cardiomyopathy is generally unresponsive to bronchodilator therapy, which differentiates it from asthma.

Universal screening is costly, and in-depth screening can provoke considerable anxiety for patients and families without clear benefit. As a result, screening has focused on select populations who are deemed to be at risk, such as competitive athletes. However, even in this selected group, the incidence of SCA is low, and the impact of screening for SCA and the optimal approach remain uncertain, as evidence is conflicted and limited. This issue is discussed in detail separately.

For example, early screening for primary electrical conduction defects (eg, long QT syndrome) might need to be performed within the first year of life to detect affected infants and young children at risk for SCD. In contrast, clinical manifestations of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are not commonly observed until adolescence, and screening for this entity might not be effective before 12 years of age.

ECG has been proposed as a universal or selective (eg, prior to sports participation) screening tool in children and adolescents; however, the sensitivity and specificity of ECG screening is highly variable and depends on the nature of the underlying cardiac condition and expertise of the clinician interpreting it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For example, false-negative ECG results can occur in patients with coronary artery abnormalities since ECG is often normal in these patients. In addition, depending on the diagnostic threshold used, false-negative ECG screening may occur in up to 20 percent of patients with long QT syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and pediatric coronary artery abnormalities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Diagnosis&quot;, section on '12-lead ECG'</a>.)</p><p>False positives are very common in ECG screening, particularly in athletes.

Group 2 findings were common in both athletes and nonathletes (33 and 22 percent, respectively). Echocardiographic evaluation of all 784 nonathletes with Group 2 findings was normal in 84 percent of patients. Only 2 percent (n = 16) of these patients had findings consistent with a morphologically mild cardiomyopathy, and the remaining had incidental findings that would not affect management.</p><p>Because randomized trials are not feasible due the low prevalence rate of pediatric SCA, studies using simulation modeling analysis have estimated the cost-benefits of different screening approaches in children based on assumptions regarding the age at screening, false-positive and false-negative rates, and costs of additional testing and treatment, if appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H871783333\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During each routine child care visit, the following aspects of the history should be included: history of syncope, near-syncope, or seizure; exercise-induced chest pain or shortness of breath; a history of sudden unexpected, unexplained death in a family member before 50 years of age; and a family history of cardiac disease associated with sudden death (eg, long QT syndrome). Physical examination includes measurement of blood pressure and resting heart rate, and cardiac auscultation to assess rate and rhythm of the heart and detect murmurs and other abnormal heart sounds. Children and adolescents who participate in an organized sport should undergo a standardized preparticipation evaluation that includes a cardiovascular assessment. (See <a href=\"#H2294933762\" class=\"local\">'Routine health care visits'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sports participation in children and adolescents: The preparticipation physical evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with either a historical or physical examination finding suggestive of an underlying cardiac disorder should be further evaluated (including ECG) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referred to a cardiac specialist with pediatric expertise. (See <a href=\"#H629206414\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation and referral'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suspected-heart-disease-in-infants-and-children-criteria-for-referral\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suspected heart disease in infants and children: Criteria for referral&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary prevention strategies aim to improve the outcomes of children who suffer SCA. Such efforts include community programs to increase public placement of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) and to teach effective bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and AED use. In addition, for survivors of SCA, secondary prevention may involve placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent SCD from subsequent episodes of arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"#H871783553\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In pediatric survivors of SCA, a comprehensive evaluation is performed to identify and treat the underlying cardiac condition. The initial assessment includes a detailed history, family history, physical examination, ECG, and echocardiogram. Additional testing is guided by the results of the initial work-up and may include ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter monitor), exercise stress test, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, electrophysiologic testing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H24489234\" class=\"local\">'Survivors of SCA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a child or adolescent dies unexpectedly, an autopsy that includes a full assessment of cardiac anatomy and histology should be performed. If a cardiac anatomic explanation for the SCD episode is not found, evaluation should include family screening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H24489265\" class=\"local\">'Victims of SCD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3862750890\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Stuart Berger, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Van Camp SP, Bloor CM, Mueller FO, et al.
