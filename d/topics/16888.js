These preferences may be related to a desire for children who will carry on the family name, support elderly parents, keep property within the family, perform specific religious rituals, or contribute more to the family's economic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Personal preference may involve only the first-born child's sex or the sex of all offspring. In some cultures, this preference is so profound that selective abortion, which is universally condemned by government and medical institutions, has resulted in skewing of national sex ratios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. The ethics of sex preselection for personal preference are beyond the scope of this discussion, but have been reviewed in a report by the ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Ethics'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Family balance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Couples with one or more children of a particular sex may strongly prefer to have a child of the opposite sex to &quot;balance&quot; the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The couple's effort to balance sexes sometimes leads to a larger family size than they would have otherwise desired. Therefore, the ability to preselect sex could help couples control both the size and sex make-up of their families. However, it has been suggested that sex allocation in mammals may result from an adaptive process involving the suitability of a mother to conceive an offspring of a particular sex; therefore, attempting to create a balanced family may be harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the sex ratio (ie, proportion of male to female births) for whites, blacks, and <span class=\"nowrap\">Asians/Pacific</span> Islanders is 105, 104, and 106 males to 100 females, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, the probability of delivering a boy in any pregnancy is about 51 percent; this probability remains constant and is independent of the sex of previous siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] and parental age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Interestingly, the sex ratio appears to be higher (more males per 100 females) early in gestation, but may be lower in pregnancies conceived with ICSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">X-linked disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are over 350 X-linked diseases, many of which can be severely debilitating or fatal. They occur in approximately 1 in 1000 births. In most cases, these disorders are carried by females and expressed only in males. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be possible if an identifiable mutation or known marker exists for the disease. </p><p>However, in families without an identifiable mutation or other marker, determination of affected offspring through prenatal or preimplantation diagnosis is not possible. Therefore, the only way to be certain of having an unaffected child is to continue only those pregnancies with female progeny. Sex preselection can prevent situations in which couples struggle with the decision to terminate a pregnancy with a possibly unaffected male (when there is no test for prenatal diagnosis) or an affected male (when prenatal diagnosis shows the disease is present).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Unequal sex incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some non-Mendelian disorders are distributed with unequal sex incidence. Diseases with a higher male incidence are autism spectrum disorders, pyloric stenosis, Hirschsprung disease and otosclerosis. Diseases with a higher female incidence include breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Graves disease. A couple may opt for sex selection in order to avoid having a child with a specific disorder if no genetic marker is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For example, with autism, if a couple has more than one child with autism, their risk of having an affected child with their next pregnancy is 25 percent, so this couple may opt for sex selection to decrease their odds of having an affected child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sex of a child depends upon whether fertilization of the haploid ovum occurs with a haploid spermatozoon containing an X or a Y chromosome. This process is affected by a variety of factors and attempts to influence it have been practiced as long ago as ancient Greece. Currently, scientific techniques used to select sex have focused on preconception sex selection, which utilizes techniques for sperm separation prior to fertilization, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which selects the desired sex after fertilization and prior to implantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INEFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of publications in the lay press have purported to help parents determine the sex of their child. Timed intercourse and diet are the two most common methods, but neither is effective, and we do not recommend them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Preconception Sex Selection Diet is based on the theory that a couple can improve their chances of having a female infant by increasing dietary intake of both calcium and magnesium; to improve chances of having a male offspring, dietary intake of sodium and potassium should be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Follow-up studies have not been able to verify these claims.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Timed intercourse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timing intercourse for sex selection is based upon the belief that Y-bearing sperm move faster, but do not live as long, as X-bearing sperm. However, studies which have attempted to correlate the sex of offspring with timing of intercourse have reported conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. There is no strong evidence that timing plays an influential role in sex selection.</p><p>Time to pregnancy is considered a measure of fertility in couples not using contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Interestingly, it has been postulated that the time to pregnancy affects the secondary sex ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The proposed mechanism is that environmental factors that affect sperm or oocyte quality may also affect sex. However, analysis of pooled data from large population surveys does not support this hypothesis: no association was found between the sex ratio and time to pregnancy, either within individual datasets or in the pooled analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sperm separation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend not using sperm separation techniques for sex selection because they have not been found to be as reliable as initially reported. When fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used to determine the Y- and X-bearing sperm concentrations of separated fractions, these techniques were shown to be ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>]. Despite the lack of evidence for these techniques, they are unfortunately still marketed to patients as options by some medical practices.</p><p>The purported basis of preconception sex selection techniques is the ability to separate semen into X-bearing and Y-bearing sperm. Sperm carrying the desired sex would then be used for fertilization via intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization. Sperm separation relies on differences between human spermatozoa; Y-bearing sperm have smaller heads, enhanced swimming ability, and a lower net negative charge than X-bearing sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Sephadex column</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sperm are fractionated through a column of Sephadex-G 50 and Locke's solution, which seems to improve overall spermatozoa motility in the final fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In one study, some samples had only a 6 percent change in the proportion of X and Y spermatozoa while other samples showed increases of as much as 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Modified swim up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swim-up techniques are based on the principle of motility; therefore, the top layer of the supernatant will disproportionately be populated by faster moving Y-bearing sperm, while the slower X-bearing sperm will disproportionately remain at the bottom portion. The upper layer of supernatant is removed and centrifuged, and the resulting pellet used for insemination. In one study, the proportion of males born from singleton pregnancies was approximately 90 percent in the group treated by a modified method of swim-up sperm preparation prior to insemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Albumin gradient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spermatozoa are separated by filtering semen through columns of albumin solutions of differing concentrations. It has been hypothesized that the male sperm can be isolated because they reach the bottom more quickly due to their assumed ability to move more quickly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/32,38,40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38,40-44</a>]. Some studies claim isolates containing 43 to 76 percent male sperm can be achieved with this method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/32,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38</a>]. However, confirmatory studies with reliable molecular techniques have not been able to replicate even a small enhancement in concentration of male sperm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Percoll</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sperm are filtered through a gradient of multiple layers of Percoll at different concentrations. X- and Y-bearing sperm are separated with low speed centrifugation based upon their size and weight. Because X-bearing sperm are thought to be larger and denser than Y-bearing sperm, they tend to migrate through the gradient more quickly and can be isolated from the Y-bearing sperm. Y-bearing sperm concentrations of 77 to 85 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>When studies used FISH analysis to confirm sex concentrations after Percoll separation were performed, only a slight enhancement of X-bearing sperm was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Apparently, Percoll interferes with the stain that was used to identify sex in the sperm, leading to the artificially elevated counts of X-bearing sperm in previous studies. Therefore, although a small increase in X-bearing sperm may be noted, it is not enough to alter sex ratios when used in clinical practice.</p><p>As discussed above, when FISH was used to determine whether these sperm separation techniques produced isolates enriched by X- or Y-bearing sperm, the proportions were approximately 50-50 and not significantly different from untreated sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">FLOW CYTOMETRY FOR SPERM SEPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the methods described above, flow cytometry has had consistent success in sperm separation as documented by confirmatory genetic testing. Microsort holds the patent on flow cytometry for sperm sorting, which was available at limited facilities in the United States and only to those families at risk of transmitting a X-linked disease or to couples desiring family balancing (ie, selecting for the sex that comprises less than 50 percent of the children in a family). Microsort technology purports to increase the percentage of X-bearing sperm to 88 percent in a X-sorted sample and to increase the percentage of Y-bearing sperm to 74 percent in Y-sorted samples. The success rates in terms of pregnancies achieved of desired sex are 93 percent for females and 82 percent for males.</p><p>In flow cytometry, sperm are sorted by sex based upon the amount of genetic material the spermatozoa carries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Human X-bearing sperm are 2.8 percent heavier than Y-bearing sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].The process involves coating the sperm with a nontoxic fluorescent dye (Hoechst 33342: bisbenzimide) that binds to the outside of the DNA helix. It preferentially binds to triplet adenine and thymine base pairs in the minor groove and is reversible at 37C. Ultraviolet (UV) beams are passed across the dyed spermatozoa to excite the fluorochrome. The spermatozoa containing more genetic material, the X-bearing sperm, will have increased fluorescent intensity and be recognized by a fluorescence detector and then sorted to separate the X- and Y-bearing sperm.</p><p>A large amount of sperm is lost in the sorting process due to lack of orientation, undetermined fluorescence, or undesired sex. After undergoing sorting, it is not unusual to end up with a sample containing 100,000 to 300,000 motile sperm from a sample that originally started with over 50 million motile sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>There have been concerns regarding mutagenicity of both the bisbenzimide dye and the UV light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Increased embryo loss has been seen in animals after application of flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Additionally, UV light has been shown to cause some chromosomal abnormalities in animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. There are also reports of mutagenicity in mouse spermatozoa after use of bisbenzimide; however, the level of the dye used was much higher than the levels used with flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Other studies have shown no mutagenic affects from the combination of the bisbenzimide dye and UV exposure during the sorting process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/46,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,57,58</a>].</p><p>No abnormalities have been noted in the several hundred animals that have been born after undergoing flow cytometry. The first human baby born from the Microsort process was in 1995; over 1200 children have been born subsequently. In 1998, follow-up of 29 children exposed to this sorting process found them to be normal and healthy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Although flow cytometry appears to be safe, more long-term data are needed to confirm efficacy. After a long US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review period following the initial clinical trial, Microsort failed to obtain FDA approval for clinical use. Therefore, this technique has not been available in the United States as of March 2012.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PREIMPLANTATION GENETIC SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) refers to a process of cell biopsy and genetic analysis before implantation. Typically, trophectoderm cells are biopsied from blastocyst stage embryos. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An embryo's karyotype can be identified as male or female using one of several techniques (comparative genomic hybridization arrays, single nucleotide polymorphisms arrays, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and next generation sequencing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. In addition to learning the sex of the embryo, all of these techniques will simultaneously provide comprehensive chromosomal screening of the embryo to eliminate the transfer of embryos that are aneuploid (genetically unbalanced). Regardless of the technique used, the analysis usually takes several days to perform, and at this time the most common practice is to freeze the blastocysts and transfer them back in the next cycle as a frozen embryo transfer. However, some clinics do have the capability to transfer back embryos the day after the biopsy when the turn-around timing for the chromosomal screening is overnight. PGS is very expensive, typically ranging from $2500 to $5000, and is only offered in conjunction with in vitro fertilization. Pregnancy rates after PGS are very good [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. There do not seem to be any adverse or long-term issues to offspring from the PGS procedure; however, extensive long-term data are lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ETHICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro fertilization (IVF) in conjunction with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) has created the potential for parents to choose the sex of their children. But who should have access to these techniques? Should they be available only to assist in avoidance of an X-linked disease or should everyone have the option of controlling the sex of their offspring?</p><p>Those who oppose the use of sex selection believe it could reinforce sex biases or lead to sex ratio imbalances. This is especially relevant in countries where males are highly prized, and sex ratio imbalances already exist. As an example, in some areas of China, there are 117 males to 100 females and in one rural district of India the ratio is 187 males to 100 females; whereas the worldwide norm is 105 males to 100 females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. A Gallup Global Study reported only parents in Spain and Iceland had a preference for female offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Even in the United States, a survey of clinics using albumin gradients for sex selection reported that over 80 percent of couples seeking sex selection desired a male child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, one subsequent study observed that if PGD were offered for sex selection of a first born child, nulliparous women did not significantly prefer one sex over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] and another noted that sex choices in the US varied among ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A web based questionnaire assessing preferences for sex of children was answered by 1197 individuals with the following preferences: a family with an equal number of boys and girls (50 percent), more boys than girls (7 percent), more girls than boys (6 percent), only boys (5 percent), only girls (4 percent), and no preference (27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In a study of sex ratios at birth in the United States from 1991 to 2002, the <span class=\"nowrap\">male/female</span> sex ratio for second and subsequent births increased relative to first births for Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian and Korean populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. This is a reversal of the normal trend in the sex ratio with increasing parity and therefore could be indicative of prenatal sex selection. </p><p>Another important issue is the potential psychological harm done to children, regardless of whether they are the desired or undesired sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Parents may be disappointed when the child of a selected sex does not behave in the expected sex-specific ways. There is also concern about the creation and destruction of excess embryos for the sole purpose of selecting an embryo of a particular sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Proponents of sex selection believe that historically couples have been given many choices in reproductive matters, both legally and ethically. Therefore, individuals should be able to exercise their reproductive choices unless substantial harm to other individuals or to society in general occurs. Furthermore, with selection of sex prior to implantation, postconception selection with pregnancy termination, which is common in many countries, can be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Position of major medical societies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">American Society for Reproductive Medicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) is the governing body for fertility specialists in the United States. In 1994, the Ethics Committee of the ASRM first stated its approval for the use of reproductive technologies to decrease the chance of having a child with a genetic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. They have subsequently issued reports discussing the varied ethical, medical, and legal issues involved with using PGS for sex selection for nonmedical purposes in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/8,72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,72-74</a>]:</p><p>The following excerpt from the 2015 consensus statement from the Ethics Committee of ASRM summarizes their current recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In conclusion, assisted reproductive technology (ART) practitioners who currently offer or decline to offer sex selection for non-medical purposes do so against a varied ethical and legal backdrop. Recognizing reasoned differences of opinion, the ASRM Ethics Committee has not reached consensus on whether it is ethical for providers to offer ART for sex selection for non-medical purposes. Arguments regarding patient autonomy and reproductive liberty have been offered in support of the practice. Risks and burdens of the procedure, gender bias, sex stereotyping and nonacceptance of offspring, efforts to guard against coercion, and issues of justice all raise concerns about the practice. Practitioners must take care to ensure that parents are fully informed about the risks and burdens of the procedure and that they are not being coerced to undergo it. Because the practice is so controversial, clinics are encouraged to draft and make available written policies setting forth whether and under what circumstances non-medical sex selection will be available. When non-medical sex selection is offered in clinical practice, clinic employees with objection to the technique must be permitted to absent themselves from its provision.</p><p>Although the ASRM has published these recommendations, in a 2008 survey of IVF clinics in the United States, 74 percent of participating clinics provided PGS for at least one indication and 42 percent of the providers acknowledged access to, and provision of, PGS services for sex selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee on Ethics opposed meeting parental requests for sex selection for personal reasons, such as family balancing, due to concerns that &quot;such requests ultimately support sexist practices&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21140069\"><span class=\"h3\">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2002, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates all infertility clinics in the United Kingdom, conducted a review of sex selection techniques, including their safety, reliability and arrangements for their regulation. This consultation resulted in the Authority&rsquo;s 2002-2003 decision, which concluded that sex selection for non-medical reasons should not be permitted, whether through sperm sorting or embryo selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176214939\"><span class=\"h3\">European Society of Human Reproduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The European Society of Human Reproduction (ESHRE) task force on ethics and law is divided about the issue of sex selection for non-medical reasons in the setting of assisted reproduction as stated in their 2013 document [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. They recommended broader delineation of accepted medical reasons for the practice beyond avoiding a serious sex-linked disorder, and asked for clarification of the clinician&rsquo;s legal position when confronted with parental requests for sex selection at embryo transfer after medically indicated preimplantation genetic diagnosis or routine preimplantation screening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9489449\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTIMPLANTATION SEX SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex selection can be achieved after implantation by prenatal sex determination followed by pregnancy termination if the child is not of the desired sex. Traditionally, identification of fetal sex has been determined by karyotype analysis of fetal chromosomes obtained by chorionic villus sampling (first trimester) or amniocentesis (second trimester). Both are invasive and expensive procedures with procedure-related risks. Alternatively, ultrasound examination can be used to visualize the fetal genitalia, usually in the second trimester. Although sexual differentiation takes places between weeks 6 and 9 of gestation, the external genitalia appear similar on ultrasound examination until 11 to 12 weeks of gestation and 100 percent accuracy of sex prediction is not achieved until 13 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Sonography is noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and widely available.</p><p>Fetal sex can also be determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for Y chromosome sequences in cell free fetal DNA in maternal blood, which can be measured as early as 5 weeks of gestation and rapidly falls after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>]. Most research studies have reported over 90 percent accuracy using the PCR technique in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/77,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,81</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In 2005, commercial companies began marketing first trimester sex identification kits directly to the public. Women who purchase these kits use the enclosed equipment to send a few drops of their blood to the laboratory. The techniques used by the company and data regarding accuracy have not been disclosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], and the company states that test results should not to be used for medical decision making.</p><p>The procedure used for this diagnosis is crucial for ensuring accuracy. This was illustrated in a National Institute of Child Health and Human Development study that collected 20 mL of peripheral blood from 20 pregnant women between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation and sent aliquots to five laboratories for sex identification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The sensitivity of the assay for detection of male DNA when the fetus was male varied from 31 to 97 percent among centers.</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates the manufacturers of genetic tests, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which promotes health and quality of life, have warned the public some of these tests lack scientific validity, and others provide medical results that are meaningful only in the context of a full medical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. They suggest that genetic tests should be performed in a specialized laboratory, and the results should be interpreted by a doctor or trained genetics counselor because of the complexities involved in both the testing and the interpretation of the results. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2230267176\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
