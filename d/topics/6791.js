Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) accounts for approximately 12 to 15 percent of all cases. </p><p>This topic discusses the evaluation of patients with chest pain who are at low or intermediate risk for ACS as assessed by the results of the initial history, physical exam, electrocardiogram, and initial biomarkers. The approaches to patients with chest pain not likely to be due to myocardial ischemia or to those with a high likelihood of ACS are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with chest pain in the emergency department&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF ACS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &ldquo;acute coronary syndrome&rdquo; (ACS) is applied to patients in whom there is evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. There are three types of ACS: ST elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina (UA). The first two are characterized by a typical rise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fall in serum troponin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. UA is characterized by myocardial ischemia without elevated biomarkers and is often a clinical diagnosis based on history, dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or inducible ischemia on stress testing. Establishing whether a patient has ACS requires integration of information obtained from a careful patient interview and examination as well as from serial evaluation of the ECG, troponin levels, and occasionally provocative testing results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Third universal definition of MI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2177452182\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS THE GOAL OF EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ruling in an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in a timely manner is a high priority, as early intervention in patients with ACS has been shown to lead to better outcomes. Conversely, for patients without an ACS, it is important that time and resources not be spent pursuing the diagnosis of ACS.</p><p>Similarly, other patients who present to the healthcare system with chest pain have another cause or chest pain that requires urgent attention such as trauma, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H1220523642\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'Life-threatening etiology'</a>.) </p><p>Many patients with chest pain do not fall into one of these two groups (obvious ACS or another life-threatening diagnosis). Their risk of an ACS needs to be assessed in an expeditious manner. While we have identified specific times in this process when evaluation must take place rapidly, evaluation is a continuous process and new information at any time point can alter a patient&rsquo;s risk category. For example, worsening of symptoms or new electrocardiographic changes on continuous monitoring can make the possibility of an ACS more likely. </p><p>Care providers should also simultaneously be evaluating other elements of the differential diagnosis of the patient's symptoms. The larger discussion of the initial diagnostic approach to patients with chest pain is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with chest pain in the emergency department&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-dyspnea-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with dyspnea in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary focus in the very early evaluation (generally within the first 15 minutes after presentation) of patients with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is to reasonably confirm or exclude in an expeditious manner ACS as a cause for the patient's symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F107583\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107583 \">algorithm 1</a>). In this early time period, reasonable confirmation of ACS is generally secured by the finding of diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. ACS is reasonably excluded when the probability of ACS is very low (generally considered below a 1 to 2 percent threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]). For patients who have or are likely to have an ACS, appropriate management strategies should be initiated.

Emergency Medical Service evaluation and transport result in more rapid and focused evaluation by streamlining the triage process. </p><p>Prehospital evaluation should include obtaining a prehospital 12-lead ECG and continuous ECG monitoring. </p><p>A reperfusion protocol should be initiated as early as possible after the diagnostic prehospital ECG and the patient should be taken to the most appropriate hospital in patients whose ECGs have evidence of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.

Patients whose ECGs are diagnostic for or strongly suggestive of either ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction should be managed for those diagnoses.

We believe this is a reasonable strategy. <br/><br/>In the United States, sensitive troponins are available, while in many other countries, such as many in Europe, <strong>high sensitivity</strong> troponins are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. We believe that the results of the first set of biomarkers should be made available within 60 minutes. In most patients, at least two sets of troponin are required; the second test is obtained about three hours after the first.

Very low-risk patients generally have none of the risk factors found in the table. <br/><br/>We manage patients as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient's likelihood of ACS is very low (&lt;1 to 2 percent), additional testing for ACS is not likely to be beneficial. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All other patients with possible (but not definite) ACS should be further risk stratified by the measurement of serum troponin, if not already ordered.

Any changes in clinical condition (eg, patient complaints or change in vital signs) should prompt reassessment. Serial ECGs should be performed on patients with continuous pain or changes in symptoms to detect dynamic changes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients felt to have definite ACS or high risk should be managed accordingly.

It has been suggested that an acceptable lower limit of pretest probability for ACS, above which further testing should be done, is 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. We believe patients below this threshold are very low risk, and unlikely to benefit from additional testing for an ACS. All other patients should receive further testing and risk stratification. </p><p>Providers commonly identify very low-risk patients using an experienced clinician&rsquo;s unstructured clinical estimate. In an evaluation of this method, approximately 25 percent of chest pain patients were classified as very low risk (&lt;2 percent risk), and these patients experienced an event rate of 0.7 percent (95% CI 0-2.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. With the introduction of clinical decision aids, many clinicians and health systems have moved towards more objective classification systems, typically incorporating serum troponin measurements. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'After return of troponin'</a> below.) </p><p>When formulating the clinician's pretest probability, it is important to avoid eliminating the possibility of an ACS when an alternative diagnosis is possible. In patients being evaluated for chest pain, it has been shown that those with a &quot;clear-cut&quot; alternative noncardiac diagnosis still have a 4 percent rate of ACS at 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, patients with a &quot;clear-cut&quot; alternative noncardiac diagnosis and a TIMI risk score of 0 had a 2.9 percent rate of ACS at 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, among patients with ACS, a common misdiagnosis is gastroesophageal reflux disease. In two different datasets, it has been shown that patients with ACS commonly describe their pain as burning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A gastrointestinal etiology should be assigned only after the diagnosis of a cardiac emergency has been excluded. Further, a trial of antacids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> should not be used as a reliable method to determine whether a pain is of gastrointestinal or cardiac origin.<br/><br/>Certain populations also have increased risk for missed ACS. Four populations that are more likely to be discharged from the emergency department with ACS include: women &lt;55 years old, nonwhite patients, dyspnea as the primary complaint, and patients with a normal ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We recommend that clinicians incorporate all data elements when forming an unstructured estimate of ACS probability, avoid overreliance on the presence of an alternative diagnosis, and use caution when defining the very low-risk patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">AFTER RETURN OF TROPONIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States and other geographies, sensitive troponins are used. In Europe (and elsewhere) high sensitivity troponins have become available. The approach to the patient may vary depending on the available test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F107583\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107583 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>If the first troponin returns elevated, in a setting consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the management for non-ST segment myocardial infarction begins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For those patients whose first sensitive troponin is normal, monitoring continues until a second troponin returns. The second troponin should be obtained three hours after the first. In some select patients with a reliable symptom onset and a low suspicion for ACS, a single troponin measured six hours after symptom onset is acceptable.</p><p>After return of the second troponin, tools such as the TIMI and HEART risk scores should be used in conjunction with care pathways to guide decisions regarding further testing (eg, stress testing or cardiac imaging) and disposition, and to guide interim medical therapies. In addition, these tools can predict the risk of adverse short-term outcomes (30-day risk of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischemia). </p><p>On occasion, some patients will require a third troponin. Examples include those with stuttering pain, new return of pain while in the emergency department (ED), patients presenting very soon after the onset of symptoms, and those in whom the clinician has a high degree of concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348364682\"><span class=\"h2\">Care pathways using a sensitive troponin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk prediction scores have been developed and integrated into care pathways.

The TIMI score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-thrombolysis-in-myocardial-infarction-timi-score-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) was derived and validated in patients enrolled in clinical trials with ACS, but has since been validated in patients suspected to have ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Advantages include simplicity, lack of a need for a nomogram or computer algorithm, and its ability to predict a risk of short-term (30 days) outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among the elements of the TIMI risk score, troponin elevation was the most powerful factor. However, even TIMI 0 patients had a significant 2.1 percent incidence of the composite outcome. As such, the TIMI score has limited utility as a tool to determine who can be discharged as very low risk with no further testing.</p><p>The HEART score uses similar components to the TIMI risk score (electrocardiogram [ECG], age, risk factors, and a single sensitive troponin) but also incorporates the level of physician suspicion of an ACS based on the history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105869 \">table 1</a>). The HEART score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] has been validated at four sites in The Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Validation in the United States illustrated the need to add a three-hour troponin to achieve high sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664044803\"><span class=\"h3\">Care pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not discharge patients at low to moderate risk of an ACS based on the results of the risk prediction models presented above. We believe that information obtained from additional monitoring and a second sensitive troponin is necessary. We apply the HEART pathway (that extends the HEART score) to our patients at low to moderate risk of an ACS.</p><p>Both the TIMI risk score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-thrombolysis-in-myocardial-infarction-timi-score-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and the HEART score, discussed directly above, have been integrated into care pathways that allow the rapid and safe disposition of patients. These care pathways are referred to as the HEART Pathway and the ADAPT, and have been tested in single center randomized trials. We prefer the HEART pathway to ADAPT, as it appeared to identify more patients for early discharge in validation studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The HEART Pathway consists of the HEART Score plus a three-hour sensitive serum troponin measurement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105869 \">table 1</a>). Very low risk is considered a HEART Score of 3 or less, plus two negative troponin measurements at times 0 and 3 hours below the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile. Three United States validations have examined the HEART Pathway in over 2000 patients and have consistently shown a sensitivity of &gt;99 percent for 30-day cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/16,18,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19,21</a>]. The HEART Pathway was validated in a single-center prospective randomized trial in which the HEART Pathway allowed the safe, early discharge of 40 percent of patients without the need for stress testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. No patients had adverse cardiac events at 30 days; the rate of objective cardiac testing after discharge was decreased and the time to discharge was shortened. These data suggest it identifies a very low-risk population and reduces the need for provocative testing. Further validation is ongoing in the United States. </p><p>Patients identified as<strong> </strong>low risk with these approaches can be discharged home with primary care follow-up. However, with all decision aids, it is important to incorporate the provider&rsquo;s clinical gestalt into this decision. The decision to pursue outpatient evaluation, especially if additional testing is likely to be required, should be discussed with the patient. There are many reasonable evaluation strategies, including performing the entire evaluation and stress imaging during the index encounter. We recommend a structured evaluation with the HEART Pathway and expedited discharge of patients stratified as low risk. When pursuing this strategy, we encourage clinicians to discuss this with their patients and consider patient preferences in this decision. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive evaluation'</a> below.) </p><p>Some patients will have been assessed to be at high risk, despite a normal biomarker, because of the presence of ongoing chest pain, new ECG changes, or heart failure.

The protocol included pretest probability scoring by the TIMI risk score, electrocardiography, and 0- and 2-hour troponin I values. In ADAPT, the accelerated diagnostic protocol successfully identified very low-risk patients; the sensitivity and a negative predictive value were 99.7 percent for the primary end point of major adverse cardiac events within 30 days. In a single-center, randomized validation of the accelerated diagnostic protocol, the proportion of patients safely discharged within six hours of ED arrival increased from 11 to 19 percent with use of the protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, patients identified for early discharge received outpatient stress testing within 72 hours. Thus, in both studies, patients received close aggressive follow-up care, including additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions as necessary. Limitations of this literature include the uncertain generalizability to other institutions and healthcare systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3250062585\"><span class=\"h2\">Highly sensitive troponin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As more sensitive troponin (high sensitivity troponin) assays become available, the need for clinical data incorporated into care pathways could be reduced. Some of these have been referred to as abbreviated biomarker strategies. Before we recommend implementation of these alternative approaches, they should undergo further prospective validation, and should include the diagnostic accuracy for short-term (30-day) ACS events, including the need for revascularization.</p><p><br/>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTn) assays, which are available in many European countries but not the United States, have the ability to identify patients with myocardial infarction earlier than sensitive troponin tests, as well as to identify patients who are not suffering myocardial infarction. With these tests, an initial normal value combined with lack of an increase in the first two hours essentially excludes myocardial infarction, but not necessarily unstable angina. They may also be capable of identifying patients at extremely low risk of acute myocardial infarction and whose long-term prognosis is good [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In a 2014 study of 14,636 patients with chest pain, the negative predictive values for myocardial infarction and death within 30 days in those with a hs-cTn of &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> (undetectable) and no signs of ischemia on ECG were 99.8 and 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>The negative predictive value of negative high sensitivity (fourth generation) cardiac troponin I assay at presentation to the hospital was evaluated in the High-STEACS prospective cohort (derivation) study of 4870 patients with suspected ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. With this assay, the limitation of detection was 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> and an upper reference limit (99<sup>th</sup> percentile) was 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> in men and 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> in women. The primary outcome was index myocardial infarction, or subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. A troponin concentration &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> had a negative predictive value of 99.6 percent. The effectiveness of combining this test with clinical information for the purpose of selecting patients for early discharge remains to be determined. The one group that had a less robust negative predictive value included individuals who presented in two hours or less from the onset of symptoms. Caution is necessary with these early rapid approaches for such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation unit approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observation units can be used to complete subsequent assessment with serial cardiac markers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stress imaging in patients requiring further evaluation. Those without elevated serum troponin but who remain above a 1 to 2 percent probability of ACS will require cardiac imaging or stress testing. We recommend observation unit use in such patients who are not low risk according to the HEART Pathway. In hospitals without an observation unit, these patients can be placed on the hospital ward in observation or inpatient status.</p><p>Observation units can take several forms. At the most basic level, observation is a patient status during which ongoing testing occurs in the ED. The more common scenario is a specialized area, under control of either ED physicians, inpatient physicians, or both, in which patients receive ongoing testing and monitoring in a systematic way.</p><p>Chest Pain Observation Units (CPUs) or Clinical Decision Units (CDUs) are a safe and efficient use of resources to evaluate patients with chest pain with both intermediate and low probability of having ACS. In a study of over 1000 mostly low-risk patients, the discharge rate was 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Since that time, randomized trials have proven their effectiveness and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], including one single center trial of 424 patients at intermediate risk for having ACS demonstrating observation units decreased resource utilization without increasing risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, a cluster randomized trial of observation unit implementation has questioned the improvement in resource utilization at 14 EDs in the United Kingdom, in which there was no decrease in admission rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A comparison of inpatient short-stay units to ED observation units was completed among 332 ED patients with chest pain at one center demonstrating that both are safe and cost effective options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The safety of assigning patients to CPUs has been demonstrated in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/30,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34</a>]. In one study, 424 patients at intermediate risk for ACS were randomly assigned to further evaluation in an ED CPU or hospital admission with cardiac monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although there was no significant difference in the rate of cardiac events, the CPU group incurred significantly less cost. No cardiac events occurred among patients evaluated and discharged from the CPU. The use of hospitalists to manage CPU patients may further reduce costs and length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>A controversial area in observation unit care is the inclusion of patients with known coronary disease, or those who are unable to exercise. Many studies of chest pain observation units excluded patients with known coronary disease. Similarly, most excluded patients unable to exercise. In principle, however, an observation unit is appropriate for any patient in whom serial negative ECGs, biomarkers, and cardiac imaging will identify a situation where hospital admission will not be necessary. Therefore, we recommend this as an option in centers equipped to conduct this evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINVASIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive evaluation is performed on patients for whom there remains a suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) despite two normal troponin values (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F107583\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107583 \">algorithm 1</a>). Such patients might be those with a high-risk designation using the HEART Pathway or those in whom the healthcare provider is still concerned based on the patient&rsquo;s risk, as calculated by a risk score such as TIMI (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-thrombolysis-in-myocardial-infarction-timi-score-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Typically, these patients have a greater than 1 to 2 percent risk of ACS.
