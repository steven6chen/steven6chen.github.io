As an example, in a large cohort study of almost 30,000 HIV-infected veterans, current smoking, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and elevated triglyceride levels were more common compared with an age- and race-matched cohort of over 50,000 HIV-uninfected veterans, but the median Framingham risk score was the same and intermediate in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In one analysis of the HIV Outpatient Study cohort, all three scores were able to distinguish high- from low-risk patients with moderate discriminatory function, but the <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> PCE and DAD models underestimated the risk by 12 and 20 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The mismatch between observed and predicted events occurred around the 10 percent risk threshold (near the threshold for statin initiation), with individuals with 5 to 10 percent predicted risk having a higher event rate and those with higher predicted risk having fewer events. Models that included HIV disease variables did not improve risk prediction. In another report, applying the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> PCE model increased the number of patients in whom statin therapy was recommended as compared with the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (which is based on the Framingham risk score); however, in the majority of HIV-infected adults with evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis (carotid artery intima-media thickening), statins were not recommended based on either approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>These results suggest that, while none of the available risk assessment tools are optimal for HIV-infected patients, the PCE is a reasonable starting place for clinical use until more data are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343287959\"><span class=\"h1\">MINIMIZING THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to cardiovascular risk reduction in HIV-infected patients is not precisely defined, but it is widely accepted that, in addition to suppression of HIV viremia, the same risk reduction techniques that are used in uninfected individuals should apply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The findings that traditional risk factors do appear to predict risk in HIV-infected individuals further support this point. These strategies include, if indicated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use, statin therapy, blood pressure control, and management of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Additionally, counseling about lifestyle interventions should address potentially modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol use, diet, and lack of physical activity.

Compared with the uninfected participants, a significantly greater number of HIV-infected patients had a dietary history above the United States recommended allowances for total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intake. The investigators postulated that the increased intake of saturated fat and cholesterol contributed to the elevated triglycerides that were also noted in this patient population. These data suggest the potential benefit of dietary counseling in HIV-infected individuals.</p><p>The benefit of intensive dietary guidance is further supported by the results of a trial of 83 HIV-infected patients newly initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), in which all subjects received individually tailored nutritional counseling and then were randomly assigned to quarterly nutritional guidance or no further counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Briefly, statin therapy, specifically, is an intervention that reduces the relative cardiovascular risk by approximately 20 to 30 percent. Thus, the absolute benefit of statin therapy becomes greater with higher cardiovascular risk, and so cardiovascular risk assessment is an essential component of the decision to initiate a statin. Patients and providers can then decide whether the individual absolute risk reduction is large enough to be worth the cost, burdens, and potential side effects of statin therapy. The decision on whether to initiate statins is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be evaluated at the initial visit and continually assessed over time. This evaluation can then be used to predict an individual's overall cardiovascular risk using established multivariate risk models, such as the Framingham risk score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-10-year-general-cardiovascular-disease-men-framingham-2008-paper\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-10-year-general-cardiovascular-disease-women-framingham-2008-paper\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) or the American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> <a href=\"http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/&amp;token=VRaplR+cbMuyC9nZnmGwUjjI1XijifrBdozpWdA30+URGITLJqXb1ZCBV1+SPUV9sngYdIu1CIIoXhacW0fSQQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3739\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Pooled Cohort Equations CV Risk Calculator</a>. Although the utility of these calculators in the HIV-infected population may not be optimal and may underestimate the true risk, they are likely a reasonable starting point. We typically use the <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> Pooled Cohort Equations model. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Assessing cardiovascular risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach to cardiovascular risk reduction in HIV-infected patients is not precisely defined, but it is widely accepted that the same risk reduction strategies that are used in uninfected individuals should apply. These strategies include, if indicated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use, statin therapy, blood pressure control, and management of diabetes. Additionally, counseling about lifestyle interventions should address potentially modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol use, diet, and lack of physical activity. (See <a href=\"#H343287959\" class=\"local\">'Minimizing the risk of cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We screen for diabetes mellitus with hemoglobin A1c <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fasting glucose at baseline, prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), within one to three months after starting a new regimen, and every three to six months thereafter, in agreement with expert groups in the United States. Strategies for glycemic control in HIV-infected patients with diabetes are generally the same as for the general population. (See <a href=\"#H343289309\" class=\"local\">'Recognizing and managing diabetes mellitus'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We screen for dyslipidemia at baseline, prior to initiating ART, within one to three months after starting a new regimen and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, in agreement with expert groups in the United States. Indications for the use of lipid-lowering therapy in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease among HIV-infected patients are the same as those for HIV-uninfected patients. Briefly, this decision involves determining if the expected absolute reduction in an individual&rsquo;s cardiovascular risk with statin therapy outweighs its cost, burdens, and potential side effects. (See <a href=\"#H534804837\" class=\"local\">'Recognizing and managing dyslipidemia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain antiretroviral agents have been associated with greater risk of cardiovascular events and dyslipidemia than others. When initiating ART in the treatment-na&iuml;ve patient with abnormal lipids or other cardiovascular risk factors, consideration should be given to initiating medications with more favorable lipid profiles, if appropriate based on other patient and viral characteristics. Such agents include integrase inhibitors. For treatment-na&iuml;ve patients who have significant cardiovascular risk and other therapeutic options, we suggest avoiding the use of an abacavir-containing backbone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H511381870\" class=\"local\">'Treatment-na&iuml;ve patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are already on ART and have abnormal lipids, there may be a modest benefit to the lipid profile in switching to a regimen that is associated with better lipid effects. Potential drawbacks to this strategy include the risk of loss of virologic control and new adverse effects or intolerance. For patients with dyslipidemia who have an undetectable viral load (and no prior history of virologic failure or drug resistance) while on a regimen containing <span class=\"nowrap\">lopinavir/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a></span> or other protease inhibitor associated with lipid abnormalities, we suggest a switch to an integrase-inhibitor based regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Alternatively, a protease inhibitor can be switched to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilpivirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilpivirine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H511381876\" class=\"local\">'Treatment-experienced patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When pharmacologic lipid-lowering therapy is warranted for primary prevention, statins are the drug of choice. In HIV-infected patients, the selection of statins should take into account the relative efficacy of the statin as well as any potential drug interactions and side effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atorvastatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pitavastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pitavastatin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> are all appropriate options. For patients taking a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor for whom statin therapy is indicated, we suggest pitavastatin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For other HIV-infected patients for whom statin therapy is indicated, we suggest atorvastatin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Statins are generally initiated at a low dose in HIV-infected patients (pitavastatin 4 mg daily, atorvastatin 10 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Statin use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated triglyceride levels are independently associated with cardiovascular risk. Fibrates may be used initially to lower triglycerides before statin use in patients who warrant pharmacologic management of cardiovascular risk and have triglyceride levels &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/d</span>.
