The two main categories of testicular tumors are germ cell tumors (GCTs), which account for 95 percent of cases, and sex cord-stromal tumors.</p><p>Testicular pathology is a nosologically complex subject because of the spectrum of histologic subtypes and variable clinical behavior, particularly among GCTs. Prediction of biologic behavior depends upon the type(s) of tumors present, as well as clinical features, including the age of the patient and primary site (ie, testicular versus retroperitoneal), since histologically identical tumors can behave differently depending upon these clinical parameters. Accurate histologic evaluation and staging will help determine if a patient should be treated surgically (orchiectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection) and whether chemotherapy is indicated.</p><p>A second source of confusion is the nonuniform and often complex classification schemes for testicular tumors. Separation of a few of the major subtypes can be somewhat subjective (eg, there can be morphologic overlap between various subtypes of GCTs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]; however, in many cases these distinctions may not be pivotal in the choice of therapy and management. The classification scheme used herein is relatively simple, practical, widely accepted, and of proven clinical utility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81626 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Pathologic evaluation is generally performed on the entire testis rather than on a biopsy sample. Examination of the entire testis allows identification of the histopathologic tumor type, as well as an assessment of the stage and extent of the disease, both of which have an important bearing on subsequent management and prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110731%7EONC%2F110732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 graphicRef110732 \">table 2A-B</a>). Histologic features help to determine higher stage include vascular or lymphatic invasion and spread beyond the tunica albuginea or into the spermatic cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The management of testicular tumors is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTICULAR ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The testis is composed of lobules of seminiferous tubules, interlobular septa, the mediastinum testis, rete testis, the tunica albuginea, and tunica vaginalis. The lobules are roughly pyramid shaped, and each contains one to four U-shaped seminiferous tubules. Both ends of the seminiferous tubules empty into the rete testis, which is located posteriorly in the hilum of the testis, and drains into the epididymis. Normal seminiferous tubules have a basement membrane and a thin fibrous wall, and contain germ cells in various stages of maturation plus Sertoli cells. Blood vessels and lymphatics, mesenchymal supporting tissue, macrophages, and Leydig cells are contained within the intertubular interstitium.</p><p>Lobules are separated from each other by fibrous interlobular septa, which contain blood vessels and lymphatics. A posterior expansion of the fibrous tunica albuginea forms the mediastinum testis, which joins with the confluence of the interlobular septa. The blood vessels of the interlobular septa, together with those of the tunica albuginea, drain into those of the mediastinum testis and ultimately into those of the spermatic cord. Overlying the external surface of the tunica albuginea and separating it from the parietal tunica vaginalis is the thin mesothelial layer of the visceral tunica vaginalis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Although not strictly part of the testis, the anatomy of the draining lymphatics determines the pattern of spread of testicular tumors. In the absence of prior surgery or invasion by tumor of the scrotum, the lymphatics of the testis drain directly to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes in a predictable fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retroperitoneal-lymph-node-dissection-for-early-stage-nonseminomatous-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H25444703\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early stage nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Lymphatics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GERM CELL TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously mentioned, germ cell tumors (GCTs) account for approximately 95 percent of testicular tumors. They are near evenly distributed between pure seminomas (no nonseminomatous elements present), and all others, which together are termed nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs). NSGCTs may contain pure components (ie, only one subtype of malignant germ cells is present), or more commonly, they may consist of a heterogeneous mixture of two or more histologic subtypes. Distinction of these various subtypes of germ cell neoplasia is primarily a morphologic diagnosis, and the use of immunohistochemical stains should be reserved for difficult cases and not for routine diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/2,3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7</a>]. Additionally, careful gross examination and thorough sampling of the specimen for histologic review is important, since accurate assessment of all tumor types may be crucial in planning management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Seminoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure seminomas account for approximately 50 percent of all testicular GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and a seminomatous component is present in approximately 20 percent of mixed GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The average age at presentation for pure seminoma is approximately 40 years old (approximately 10 years older than for testicular NSGCTs). A seminomatous component is uncommon in GCTs in prepubertal males. Aside from age, there are no other reliable clinical correlates. In the ovary, a tumor nearly identical to seminoma is termed dysgerminoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific serum tumor markers are usually normal with seminomas, although beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be somewhat elevated with tumors that contain scattered syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells. Nevertheless, in such cases, the serum beta-hCG is usually only mildly elevated (&lt;100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum tumor markers in testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Seminomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">&quot;Classic&quot; seminoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic characteristics of classic seminoma include a clonal proliferation of neoplastic germ cells that demonstrate well-defined cytoplasmic borders, central to marginally located nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and clear cytoplasm secondary to intracytoplasmic glycogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74422\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74422 \">picture 1</a>). This overall pattern at low power is often described as having a &quot;fried-egg&quot; appearance. The neoplastic cells of seminoma tend to be less cohesive than in embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, or choriocarcinoma, all of which are epithelial tumors. Additionally, clusters of lymphocytes are almost invariably seen in intimate association with the tumor cells.</p><p>The differential diagnosis for seminoma includes lymphoma, especially with retroperitoneal tumors, and other GCTs, especially embryonal carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81626 \">table 1</a>). The latter distinction is most problematic when a seminoma demonstrates cytologic atypia or is poorly preserved during processing. Seminomas with atypia have previously been referred to as &quot;anaplastic seminoma&quot;; however, these tumors now are simply diagnosed as seminoma since there is no difference in prognosis for such cases, and the presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">atypia/anaplasia</span> is not mentioned.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry is usually of great help in these situations. Seminoma is immunoreactive with <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT3/4,</span> c-kit, NANOG, and D2-40; however, <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT3/4</span> and NANOG do not distinguish seminoma from embryonal carcinoma as both are positive for this marker; in contrast, yolk sac tumor and choriocarcinomas are negative for all three of these seminoma biomarkers. Traditionally, the use of cytokeratin and CD30 immunostains have been helpful in distinguishing seminoma from embryonal carcinoma, as only the latter should be positive for these markers. However, it is not infrequent for embryonal carcinomas to show only patchy or focal staining for cytokeratins and CD30, which in theory still raises the possibility of a mixed GCT instead of one that contains a pure component.</p><p>Additional immunomarkers that are now available can aid in the distinction of embryonal carcinoma from seminoma, as well as yolk sac tumor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transcription factors <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT3/4</span> and NANOG are very sensitive and specific markers that stain both embryonal carcinoma and seminoma but are negative in yolk sac tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sox-2 is a transcription factor that stains embryonal carcinoma, while being negative for both seminoma and yolk sac tumor (note that focal sox-2 staining has been observed in teratomatous elements and should not cause confusion; personal observation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, c-kit immunoreactivity is present in seminoma, but is negative in both embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditionally, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was used to stain yolk sac tumor, but background staining is frequently high, staining may only be focal, and focal staining can occasionally be seen in the non-yolk sac tumor components.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More recently, a new stem cell marker, SALL4 has been shown to stain all subtypes of GCT (except teratoma and including spermatocytic tumor) with high sensitivity but slightly lower specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. SALL4 can be used when a GCT is in the differential diagnosis of a metastatic tumor of unknown primary and is most sensitive when combined with other immunoreactive GCT biomarkers (ie, SALL4 and <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT3/4</span> immunoreactivity would be either a seminoma or embryonal carcinoma; secondary markers, as described above, can be used to distinguish these two tumor types). A primary or metastatic carcinoma that is SALL4 positive and negative for other germ cell markers, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT3/4,</span> NANOG, Sox2, and AFP, is most suggestive of a yolk sac tumor, but a non-GCT would have to be considered as well. Of note, testicular sex cord-stromal tumors are negative for SALL4, and as mentioned, a small subset of non-GCTs are focally and weakly positive for SALL4 (examples of the latter include rare SALL4 positive gastric, esophageal, and colonic carcinomas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/13,14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glypican-3 is another sensitive immunomarker for yolk sac tumor. However, studies demonstrate that it stains fewer tumor cells (ie, decreased sensitivity) when compared with SALL4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staining for hCG is usually supportive of a component of choriocarcinoma. However, it is not uncommon to find hCG-positive syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells in seminomatous GCTs, and their presence tends to correlate with a modestly elevated serum hCG concentration. This finding should be not be confused as implying the presence of a component of choriocarcinoma in the absence of other features characteristic of this type of GCT (eg, cytotrophoblast cells). The clinical significance of syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells in seminoma is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The trans-acting T-cell specific transcription factor that binds to the specific DNA sequence &quot;GATA&quot; (known as GATA3) is involved in embryogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], including development of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and other human tissues (parathyroid glands, auditory system, and kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]). For diagnostic purposes, GATA3 is typically used as a biomarker of breast and urothelial carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; however, other studies have shown GATA3 immunoreactivity in choriocarcinoma (diffuse, strong intensity), yolk sac tumor (focal to patchy, weak to moderate intensity), and within syncytiotrophoblast (in the absence of choriocarcinoma). Seminoma and embryonal carcinoma are negative for GATA3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Anaplastic seminoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term anaplastic seminoma is no longer recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO). Instead, cases that were previously classified as anaplastic are included with the <span class=\"nowrap\">typical/classical</span> seminomas.</p><p>This change in terminology is based upon the observation that the previously so-called &quot;anaplastic seminomas&quot; have similar outcomes when compared with classic seminoma of comparable stage with modern treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. It should be recognized, however, that some seminomas have increased cytologic atypia and a higher number of mitotic figures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Spermatocytic tumor (previously called Spermatocytic seminoma)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the 2016 WHO classification of urinary tumors, spermatocytic tumor is the newly recognized name for previously classified spermatocytic seminoma. Despite being classified as a variant of seminoma, a spermatocytic tumor differs from classic seminoma in essentially all histologic, immunohistochemical, molecular, and clinical characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This distinct clinicopathologic entity accounts for 1 to 4 percent of all pure seminomas and can occur in men of any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/8,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25-27</a>]. As an example, in one population-based study, the age at diagnosis among 58 cases identified ranged between 19 to 92 with a median of 54 years at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Histologically, spermatocytic tumors have a characteristic admixture of three cytologically distinct populations of neoplastic germ cells of varying size (small, medium, and large) and nuclear features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F106668\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106668 \">picture 2</a>). Immunohistochemical staining for placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT3/4</span> is negative, in contrast to classic seminoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], whereas c-kit has shown to be reactive in spermatocytic tumor in a subset of cases. Although only a few cases have been tested, SALL4 has been shown to be immunoreactive in spermatocytic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Unlike classic seminomas, spermatocytic tumors do not occur as part of mixed GCTs, do not contain an isochromosome 12p, and are not associated with intratubular germ cell neoplasia or a significant lymphocytic infiltrate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (formerly called intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spermatocytic tumors have been shown to have a favorable prognosis even in the presence of lymphovascular invasion. The one significant adverse prognostic indicator is sarcomatoid differentiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryonal carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure embryonal carcinoma accounts for approximately 2 percent of all testicular GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but it is a histologic component of approximately 85 percent of all mixed GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The average age at presentation is approximately 30 years, similar to other NSGCTs. Embryonal carcinoma is rare in prepubertal males.</p><p>Pure embryonal carcinomas usually do not produce AFP. A more than modest elevation (ie, &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> in the serum AFP concentration should prompt a suspicion that a concomitant element of yolk sac tumor is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As with seminoma, syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells within embryonal carcinomas may cause a modest elevation in the serum beta-hCG concentration. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Yolk sac tumor'</a> below.)</p><p>Microscopically, embryonal carcinoma shows epithelial differentiation with cohesive clusters and sheets of cells that are immunohistochemically positive for cytokeratin at least focally. The cells usually show marked cytologic atypia, and this is often helpful in distinguishing them from yolk sac tumors, which generally exhibit blander cytomorphology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67376\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67376 \">picture 3</a>). Several architectural patterns exist, including glandular, papillary, and solid. None of these distinctions is of any clinical significance. Syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells may be present.</p><p>The differential diagnosis is primarily with yolk sac tumor, which is often intimately associated with embryonal carcinoma, and with seminoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining can be helpful with this, as well as in the broader differential diagnosis that may arise in metastatic deposits where non-GCTs are considered in the differential diagnosis. CD30 is the traditional marker used for embryonal carcinoma; however, the use of the more recently described transcription <span class=\"nowrap\">factors/stem</span> cell markers, <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT3/4,</span> NANOG, Sox-2, and SALL4 are the most sensitive and specific immunomarkers for embryonal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, one must be aware that both <span class=\"nowrap\">OCT3/4</span> and NANOG also stain seminoma, and that SALL4 stains all subtypes of GCT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81626 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Yolk sac tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;yolk sac tumor&quot; and &quot;endodermal sinus tumor&quot; are synonymous. Pure yolk sac tumor is the most common malignant testicular GCT in prepubertal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], although teratomas are actually more prevalent in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Pure yolk sac tumor is rarely seen in the adult, whereas a component of yolk sac tumor occurs in approximately 40 percent of mixed GCTs in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Nearly all yolk sac tumors are accompanied by increased serum AFP, usually &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, the AFP level correlates with disease extent, with concentrations &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> often indicating the presence of extensive tumor. Yolk sac tumor does not produce hCG.</p><p>Microscopically, yolk sac tumors are the most morphologically variable of all GCTs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70845\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70845 \">picture 4</a>). Although a wide variety of patterns are recognized (eg, microcystic, reticular, papillary, glandular, solid, hepatoid), their only significance is the degree to which they can make the recognition of yolk sac tumor difficult. Hyaline-type globules and Schiller-Duval bodies are most characteristic of yolk sac tumor, but they are present in a minority of cases. Typically, but not invariably, yolk sac tumors have lower nuclear grade, and may be associated with edematous to myxoid stroma. Following chemotherapy, yolk sac tumors may recur with sarcomatoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glandular differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/7,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33,34</a>].</p><p>The most common entity in the microscopic differential diagnosis is embryonal carcinoma, with which yolk sac tumor often merges. Occasionally, difficulty may also be experienced in differentiating yolk sac tumor from teratoma as both can form gland-like structures. Immunohistochemical staining for AFP can be helpful when present, and is generally positive, at least focally, in yolk sac tumor. However, background staining for AFP is often high and can be positive in only a few scattered cells, at most, in embryonal carcinoma. The most specific staining profile for yolk sac tumor is the presence of SALL4 and AFP, and an absence of <span class=\"nowrap\">OC3/4,</span> NANOG, and Sox-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The presence of Glypican3 and GATA3, at least focally or multifocally, is also supportive of a yolk sac tumor diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Choriocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most aggressive and least common type of GCT is choriocarcinoma. Widespread hematogenous dissemination occurs early, and many patients present with metastatic disease. Choriocarcinoma is present as an element of approximately 10 percent of testicular mixed GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but is rare in its pure form at this site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The average age at presentation is somewhat younger than for other NSGCTs, although testicular choriocarcinoma is rare or nonexistent in the prepubertal male.</p><p>The serum beta-hCG concentration is often greater than 1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> and may even be much higher. Choriocarcinomas do not produce AFP.</p><p>Choriocarcinomas are characterized by areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, both grossly and microscopically. The most important diagnostic characteristic is the coexistence and intimate association of both syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells, which distinguishes this tumor from other GCTs with only scattered syncytiotrophoblast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57642\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57642 \">picture 5</a>). Recapitulating their normal embryonic function, the syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells and cytotrophoblastic cells often display extensive vascular invasion. This characteristic is presumed to account for the propensity for early hematogenous dissemination.</p><p>Immunohistochemical staining for hCG is of limited utility in choriocarcinomas, and the antibody is not very reliable. While the syncytiotrophoblast is essentially always strongly hCG positive, this is diagnostically insufficient. Staining for hCG generally does not help to identify the crucial cytotrophoblastic elements, which are less conspicuous on H&amp;E-stained material, and at most are only weakly beta-hCG-positive.

In children, teratomas most often occur before the age of four, are generally seen in their pure form, and behave in a benign fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In adults, teratomas are usually part of a mixed GCT, and they have the potential to be found at metastatic sites. In this setting, the teratoma appears to have a common clonal origin with the other components of the GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and likely arises from pluripotent tumor cells.

Rather, elevated tumor markers indicate the coexistence of other GCT components.</p><p>The pathology of teratomas is the most confusing of all testicular GCTs. This is because the clinical import of a given set of histopathologic findings can vary widely depending on the age and the site of the primary tumor.</p><p>Few useful guidelines exist for testicular teratomas, in contrast to ovarian teratomas, where clinically meaningful criteria for the diagnosis of immaturity exist. Only immature teratomatous elements are considered malignant in an ovarian tumor, whereas both mature and immature elements are malignant in a testicular tumor in the postpubertal patient. Thus, no distinction between mature and immature testicular teratoma for these patients is necessary. Teratomas with malignant (somatic, sarcomatous, or carcinomatous) differentiation should be reported, since findings are suggestive of a worse prognosis.

Tissue types commonly seen within a mature teratoma include respiratory tract, gut, pancreas, thyroid, cartilage, squamous epithelium, and skin adnexal structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63138\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63138 \">picture 6</a>). The degree to which undifferentiated mesenchymal elements can be present in teratomas that are termed mature is not clearly defined.</p><p>Mature cystic teratomas (dermoid cysts), common in the ovary, are quite rare in the testis. These possess only squamous epithelium, skin adnexal structures (eg, sebaceous glands), and no immature elements. No metastases have been reported from dermoid cysts, even in adult males. Similarly, uniformly benign epidermoid cysts can be seen that contain only keratinizing squamous epithelium and no other (adnexal) elements. The lack of abnormalities in chromosome 12p may be useful in distinguishing epidermoid cysts from teratomas, the latter of which contain an isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 12 (i12p) and have a potential for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Immature teratomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immature teratoma can be defined as a tumor containing undifferentiated elements resembling tissue seen in embryonic stages of development. The degree to which the tissue must be undifferentiated is not clear. The presence of primitive neuroepithelial elements justifies the use of the term immature. However, the clinical significance of their presence in this setting is not well defined, and therefore, the distinction is not typically included in a pathology report. Tissue with histologically frankly malignant features should not be included in this category.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Teratoma with malignant transformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A very small fraction of teratomas have malignant somatic-type tissue elements, such as squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or sarcoma such as rhabdomyosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Patients with tumors containing these features frequently present with metastatic disease. Teratomas with these features do not respond like other GCTs to cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.

As an example, in children, the treatment for either mature or immature teratoma is surgical; the completeness of resection rather than the histologic grade of immaturity are the most significant prognostic parameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Such tumors generally behave in a benign fashion, irrespective of the degree of immaturity, as long as there are no other GCT elements present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The finding of a significant component of a frankly malignant component (eg, rhabdomyosarcoma or adenocarcinoma) carries a distinctly poorer prognosis, especially when such a component metastasizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>As in the ovary, pure testicular neoplasms of types not usually primary to the testes are rarely seen (eg, carcinoid tumor). These have been termed &quot;monodermal&quot; teratomas.

Many possible combinations of seminoma, teratoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and choriocarcinoma can be seen. A teratomatous component is identified in approximately one-third of all mixed GCTs, and the term teratocarcinoma has, in the past, been applied to cases in which teratoma coexists with embryonal carcinoma. However, this term has largely been abandoned, and these tumors are referred to as a malignant mixed GCT, with a description of the specific GCT elements present.</p><p>In adults, the epidemiologic and clinical features of mixed GCTs are similar to those of NSGCTs. The average age at diagnosis is approximately 30 years, and they are rare in prepubertal males.

Instead, the new recognized term is &quot;germ cell neoplasia in situ&quot; (GCNIS), and it encompasses the presence of clearly malignant GCT elements within seminiferous tubules, and can include intratubular seminoma or, less commonly, intratubular embryonal carcinoma. However, a clear distinction of the intratubular component subtype is not always possible, and therefore, these are simply classified as GCNIS.</p><p>Morphologically, the in situ neoplasia often replaces all other germ cell elements. Occasionally, tumor cells may demonstrate pagetoid spread within tubules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71820 \">picture 7</a>). Intratubular neoplastic cells resemble their invasive counterparts cytomorphologically and immunophenotypically.</p><p>The clinical significance of GCNIS is not entirely clear. GCNIS has been associated with GCTs of all types in adults, except for spermatocytic tumor. The unanswered question is whether GCNIS is a precursor lesion. There is evidence that it is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>], but these data come mostly from areas (eg, Denmark) where the epidemiology of GCTs is somewhat different from that seen in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], where little or no comparable data exist. </p><p>GCNIS is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Because all of these tumors are thought to be derived from totipotential germ cells, the tumor may change its phenotype, possibly due to selection of a particular clone that gained the ability to metastasize. Another possibility is that the histologic tumor type in the metastatic focus was actually present in the primary tumor, but was not sampled for histologic examination. Last, metastatic teratoma is a frequent finding following chemotherapy even if the teratoma was not present in the primary testicular tumor because teratoma does not respond to chemotherapy, unlike the other nonteratomatous malignant germ cell elements.

In contrast to testicular GCTs, assessing the potential for malignant behavior is often difficult for SCSTs.

It has been suggested that many tumors originally classified as Sertoli cell tumor, NOS could be more accurately categorized as juvenile granulosa cell tumors, especially those found in preteen males.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry can be helpful with difficult cases, as Sertoli cells are typically positive for cytokeratin and inhibin, and are negative for placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). Inhibin positively should be interpreted with caution if the differential diagnosis includes Leydig or granulosa cell tumors. In such circumstances, WT-1 positivity can be helpful as Leydig cell and granulosa cell tumors should not react with this marker.
