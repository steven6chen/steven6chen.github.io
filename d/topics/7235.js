Lesions best suited for balloon dilation are symptomatic, benign stenoses that have failed or are not suitable for medical treatment targeted at the underlying cause of the stricture (eg, antimicrobial treatment for tuberculosis, immunosuppressive medications for sarcoidosis). The procedure is most successful in benign fibrotic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] (eg, those due to prolonged intubation) rather than in those secondary to tracheobronchomalacia, inflammation, calcification, or carcinoma. Lesions that are less suitable are those associated ulceration or mucosal fragility because of risks for rupture. Vascular lesions should probably be avoided because of the risk for rupturing vessels.

However, reports of efficacy are biased, have varying definitions of success, inconsistent lengths of follow-up, and variability in physician expertise and techniques. Nonetheless, in most patients, rates of immediate success (defined as improved airway patency upon direct visualization by bronchoscopy) and short-term success (eg, two to six weeks) are high (&gt;90 percent) with improved airway patency (radiologic and bronchoscopic), symptoms, and lung function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F116855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116855 \">picture 1</a>). However, longer-term success beyond that is unpredictable. In our experience, multiple dilations may need to be subsequently performed in order to maintain a satisfactory result. In general, only fibrous stenoses can be reliably improved with balloon dilation alone, while additional therapies (eg, electrocautery) are often needed in conjunction with balloon dilation for airway stenosis from other causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one of the largest series, balloon dilation was used to treat 19 stenoses in 16 patients with varying conditions. Ten patients were lung transplant recipients, four underwent bronchial reimplantation, one received radiation therapy, and one suffered from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Initial clinical success was achieved in two-thirds of bronchial stenoses; the remaining one-third were unsuccessful because stenoses were caused by localized bronchomalacia. Of the initial successes, half recurred but the majority of those were redilated with success (four of seven cases). Among those with fibrous stenosis, improvement in both respiratory status and appearance by bronchoscopy was seen in 70 percent of patients with a mean follow-up of 22 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another retrospective study reported that among 59 patients with benign tracheobronchial stenosis, the initial response rate (bronchoscopically, clinically, radiologically, physiologically) was 83 percent but the recurrence rate was high during a 32 month follow up (80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The patency rate was 43 percent in those who subsequently underwent repeat dilation. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although in the past, stenotic lesions were dilated using metal bougies during rigid bronchoscopy, most cases are now performed using flexible bronchoscopy and balloon airway dilation, the details of which are discussed in the sections below. </p><p>The bronchoscopist should be trained and skilled in the procedure as well as in other procedures that might be used in combination with or instead of bronchoscopic balloon dilation. Generally, at least two staff are required, one to operate the bronchoscopic equipment and another to administer medications, operate fluoroscopic equipment, and <span class=\"nowrap\">inflate/deflate</span> the balloon. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1425151319\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation, equipment, and balloon dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, balloon dilation is performed via the flexible bronchoscope with topical anesthesia and procedural sedation. However, balloon dilation is a longer procedure than routine diagnostic bronchoscopy, and may therefore require repetitive administration of medications until dilation is completed. For patients undergoing dilation for tracheal lesions (particular critical stenosis) as well as lesions associated with significant airway edema and acute airway obstruction, some experts perform dilation under general anesthesia (with laryngeal mask ventilation or intubation and rigid bronchoscopy) due to the discomfort (from the sense of asphyxiation) associated with complete occlusion of the airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The necessary equipment includes that required for bronchoscopy as well as an appropriately sized balloon catheter and guidewire. Preoxygenation is helpful, especially for tracheal lesions since the airway will be temporarily obstructed at the time of balloon inflation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview#H2538312\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview&quot;, section on 'Equipment and procedure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-preparation-procedural-technique-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Preparation, procedural technique, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Various sized catheters are available commercially with different types of balloons; a selection of balloon catheters of different diameters should be available prior to the procedure since sequential dilation with catheters of increasing diameter is common. Initial balloon catheter size is pre-selected based upon the length and diameter of the stenosis and the desired post-procedure dimensions: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Balloon length</strong> &ndash; The balloon should protrude enough beyond each end of the stenosis so that dilation of the entire lesion will occur upon balloon inflation. Damage to uninvolved airways may result if the balloon extends too far distally. In contrast, if the balloon does not extend distally enough it tends to slip out of the stenosis upon inflation. The length of the balloon is typically at least 0.5 cm greater than that of the stenotic segment. A 2.5 to 4 cm long balloon is usually adequate. The required length of balloon is estimated by computed tomographic studies (CT) as well as by passing the bronchoscope through the stenosis and measuring the distance between the proximal and distal limits of the obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Balloon diameter</strong> &ndash; The diameter of the inflated balloon needs to be larger than that of the lesion for dilation to occur, but should not be so large that excessive airway injury results. The diameter of the balloon is generally chosen to be the same as that of the lumen measured at the proximal region of the normal airway. The clinician should start with a relatively small diameter balloon and substitute progressively larger balloons as needed. The required width can be estimated from CT images and by comparing the bronchoscope diameter to that of the stenosis.</p><p/><p>Water and basic syringes should be available for balloon inflation. While balloons can be inflated using saline or even nonionic contrast medium (that can be visualized fluoroscopically), that is usually not necessary because airway strictures are dilated under direct bronchoscopic visualization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1119797572\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidewire placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the patient is adequately anesthetized and sedated, a bronchoscope with a 2 or 2.2 mm channel is passed orally; the oral route facilitates catheter insertion as opposed to the nasal route where balloon size could be limited by the nasal passage. A thorough inspection of the airways is undertaken and the stenosis is identified. If the stenosis appears amenable to balloon dilation, a 0.89 mm diameter guidewire is passed through the working channel of the bronchoscope and advanced about 1 cm beyond the stenosis. This procedure should be monitored fluoroscopically to avoid coiling or sharp bending of, or extension of the wire into the lung periphery, which can rupture the lung or bronchus. Some experts, prior to the procedure, place markers on the skin above and below the stenosis to help with guidewire placement. After adequate guidewire positioning is secured, the bronchoscope is removed and the guidewire is left in place. The placement of the guidewire should be confirmed again with fluoroscopy after the bronchoscope has been removed. </p><p>Occasionally, for severe stenosis, a small balloon catheter can be placed through the working channel of the bronchoscope (provided the diameter of the deflated catheter is less than that of the working channel) and the bronchoscope is left in place for the dilation component of the procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3084472846\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than one stenosis may be dilated during a single session. Balloon dilation may be used alone or precede or follow other procedures such as mechanical dilation (ie, bougie dilation using rigid bronchoscopy), laser, stenting, and cryotherapy, and electrocautery. None of these options or combination approaches have proven superiority. Choosing among them is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults#H883276437\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Patients with benign tracheal and bronchial strictures'</a>.) </p><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1268350084\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure is typically as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After an adequately-sized balloon catheter has been selected based upon the estimated length and width of the stenosis, it is passed over the guidewire (which is no longer within the bronchoscope) under fluoroscopic guidance. Some balloons have radiopaque markers at the proximal and distal ends so that they can be properly located with respect to the stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H1425151319\" class=\"local\">'Sedation, equipment, and balloon dilators'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1119797572\" class=\"local\">'Guidewire placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bronchoscope is then reinserted (preferably through a different route than the guidewire &ndash; eg, through the nostril) to allow direct visualization of the balloon during inflation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The balloon is inflated with water to pressures between 45 and 131 psi (3 to 9 atm) using a syringe; the generated pressure is based upon the characteristics of the particular balloon since the diameter of the balloon is proportional to the inflation pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70533 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inflation should be done gradually (over minutes) taking care to not over inflate the balloon and to avoid rupture or over dilation of the airway stricture which might result in mucosal tearing and recurrent stenosis. The initial inflation time is usually short (30 seconds to two minutes). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A pressure-gauge monitor is generally used to guide and monitor pressures throughout the procedure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The balloon is kept inflated for up to two minutes, depending upon patient tolerance and effects on oxygenation, and is then deflated. Long inflation times may be less well tolerated for dilation of tracheal lesions (where complete occlusion of the central airway occurs) compared with bronchial lesion; otherwise, there are no real differences in dilating techniques between tracheal and bronchial strictures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After deflation, the response to inflation is immediately assessed by direct bronchoscopic visualization. During balloon inflation the typical indent (&quot;waist&quot;) made by the stenosis on the balloon is lost but after deflation, the airway diameter should be visibly improved. If the result is inadequate (eg, unsuccessful dilation to the desired diameter or inability to restore improved patency), repeated inflations can be performed with the same balloon or with a longer or wider balloon that can be exchanged over the guidewire. Inflation times can usually can be increased as progressive dilation occurs (2 to 3 minutes). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once successful dilation has been achieved, the guidewire and bronchoscope can be removed, and the patient recovered. Flexible bronchoscopic balloon dilation is typically a day procedure, although some patients may need monitoring overnight (eg, those with complications or severe stenosis). </p><p/><p>Several groups use varying techniques of inflation time or pressure. For example, one group of experts achieved successful dilation for bronchial stenosis using higher pressures (up to 205 psi [14 atm]) for longer periods of time (total of 40 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, no single technique has proven superiority over the other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875352495\"><span class=\"h3\">Radial incisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For tight, circumferential strictures, it can be helpful to first make one or more radial incisions prior to balloon dilation (ie, a linear incision at one point in the lesion- like the spoke of a wheel). There are no clear guidelines on when an incision should be used and it is often-operator dependent (eg, severe stenosis with impending airway closure, repeat dilation for a stenotic lesion that was initially unresponsive to prior dilation). </p><p>Radial incisions can be made using neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (using high power density to avoid collateral tissue damage), potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, or an electrocautery knife. If an electrocautery knife is used, it is safer to use the blend or coagulation mode, rather than the cut mode, in order to assure hemostasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-electrocautery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial electrocautery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoscopic laser in the management of airway disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Where it appears intuitive that radial incisions may increase the risk of complications such as hemorrhage, tearing, or rupture, if used appropriately most experts believe that it may prevent complications such as tearing or rupture due to dilation itself, particularly when the stricture is very tight. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexible bronchoscopic balloon dilation is generally well tolerated. Most of the complications are those associated with flexible bronchoscopy, which are detailed elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50348 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-preparation-procedural-technique-and-complications#H3632275793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Preparation, procedural technique, and complications&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Complications due to balloon dilation itself are unusual. Chest pain during balloon inflation and periprocedural bronchospasm or atelectasis have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty/abstract/7,10,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,23</a>]. Excessive balloon inflation may lacerate or rupture the airway, theoretically producing hemorrhage, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or mediastinitis, but these complications have not been reported. Similarly, no reported deaths have been attributed to balloon dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Rare cases of balloon rupture have been reported without major clinical effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Although lacerations are a risk during dilation, especially when the stenosis is tight and circumferential, they often heal spontaneously after conservative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Radial incisions prior to dilation may offset this potential complication. (See <a href=\"#H875352495\" class=\"local\">'Radial incisions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1260409030\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and other experts typically assess patients clinically (signs and symptoms) approximately two weeks after balloon dilation. Some experts also perform PFTs to determine whether there is improvement in ventilatory function but it is not routine. Follow-up flexible bronchoscopy and computed tomography of the airway are not generally routinely performed unless the patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of significant residual stenosis; however, this practice is operator-dependent. </p><p>For some patients who fail dilation, the procedure can be repeated or performed in combination with other local endobronchial therapies such as stenting and occasionally surgery. Choosing among these therapies is operator-dependent with no clear guidelines on the optimal second procedure.
