Nine of these disorders are associated with expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats that encode for polyglutamine tracts in the protein products. Included in this group are Huntington disease (HD), spinobulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, and some of the spinocerebellar ataxias.</p><p>The most common presenting symptom of HD in adults is chorea (hence the name Huntington chorea). Other usual findings at presentation include memory deficits, affective disturbances, personality changes, and other manifestations of motor dysfunction such as parkinsonism and dystonia. Patients with juvenile-onset HD have minimal or no chorea, but develop myoclonus and seizures as well as cognitive and behavioral problems. Children also have a more rapidly progressive disease.</p><p>The genetics and pathogenesis of HD will be reviewed here. Clinical aspects and management of HD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Huntington disease (HD) is caused by expansion of the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene (also known as the HD or IT15 gene) located on chromosome 4p16.3 that encodes the protein huntingtin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Mutant huntingtin contains an expanded tract of glutamine residues, which is located near its amino terminal. The disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner.</p><p>HD shares several clinical features with the other polyglutamine diseases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They typically present in middle age, with progressive neuronal dysfunction and eventual neuronal loss over the ensuing 10 to 20 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The greater the number of CAG repeats on expanded alleles, the earlier the age of onset and more severe the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The repeats show both somatic and germline instability. As a result of the latter, there can be expansion of the CAG repeat number over successive generations. This may cause earlier disease onset and a progressive worsening of the phenotype in subsequent generations, a phenomenon termed anticipation. Anticipation is more common following paternal transmission of the disease allele.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A certain subset of neurons is preferentially vulnerable to dysfunction, even though the relevant protein is widely expressed throughout the brain and other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Wild-type HTT alleles have 6 to 26 CAG repeat units. Intermediate alleles have 27 to 35 repeats and rarely cause disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, alleles of &ge;27 repeats are unstable and have a tendency to expand in future generations with paternal transmission. The generally accepted threshold for developing HD is 36 repeats, but there is variable penetrance for expression of the HD phenotype with 36 to 39 CAG repeats. Full penetrance occurs with &ge;40 repeats.</p><p>Trinucleotide repeat size is estimated to account for 30 to 70 percent of the variance in age of HD symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-10</a>]. Alleles with 40 to 50 CAG repeats are found in most patients with the adult form of HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Juvenile HD is typically associated with alleles containing more than 60 CAG repeats, and some patients have more than 100 repeats. Additional factors predicting age of onset are thought to be environmental and other genetic determinants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>In addition to its effect on the age of presentation, it is generally believed that CAG repeat length is positively correlated with the rate of clinical disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. There also appears to be a positive correlation between CAG repeat length and the severity of neuropathologic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These findings suggest that large CAG expansions produce more widespread injury than smaller expansions and may affect neuronal subtypes that would otherwise be spared with smaller repeat sizes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipation and transmitting parent effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expansion of the CAG repeat number over successive generations causes an earlier and more severe phenotype, termed anticipation.</p><p>Intergenerational transmissions are associated with either slight increases of one to four CAG units or slight decreases of one to two units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, paternal transmission can sometimes produce much larger increases, on the order of seven or more CAG repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The high number of cellular divisions that occur during spermatogenesis may account for the pronounced paternal-repeat instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p>Because of the tendency for paternal transmission to result in greater expansion of the CAG repeat size, anticipation shows a major transmitting parent effect, as approximately 70 to 88 percent of symptomatic patients with juvenile HD inherit the mutant HD gene from their father [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic gain of function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expansion of CAG repeats is thought to cause toxicity through a &quot;gain of function&quot; mechanism (ie, disease develops because the mutant form of the protein gains a function that is deleterious to the cell).</p><p>Three observations are compatible with HD being caused by a dominant gain of function rather than loss of function mechanism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with homozygous disease have clinical manifestations and age of onset similar to those of heterozygous siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In contrast, the data conflict on whether the clinical course is more severe with more rapid progression in those with homozygous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction of normal huntingtin activity does <strong>not</strong> cause HD in both animal models and in humans. The clinical manifestations in mice with deletion or complete inactivation of wild-type Hdh, the homologue of the HD gene, are different from those in humans with HD. These mice die in gestation between days 8.5 and 10.5, before the emergence of the nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Thus, huntingtin is critical for early embryonic development. Mice heterozygous for Hdh inactivation are phenotypically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar findings have been noted in humans, providing further support for a gain-of-function mechanism. In addition, a patient with a breakpoint in the HD gene that led to reduced expression of huntingtin was phenotypically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In mice, replacing wild-type Hdh with a mutant Hdh allele containing 50 glutamine repeats results in normal embryonic and brain development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This finding indicates that the HD defect in humans does not mimic complete or partial Hdh inactivation.</p><p/><p>Of note, htt residues outside of the polyglutamine tract impact disease severity, suggesting that the toxic gain of function is related to a normal function of huntingtin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Distribution and function of huntingtin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Huntingtin is widely expressed throughout the brain, and is present in a large number of tissues throughout the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the neuropathology of HD appears to be limited to the central nervous system, with neuronal cell loss and atrophy of the caudate and putamen (the neostriatum) being most prominent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, the distribution of huntingtin does not correlate with the pattern of neuronal cell loss seen in HD.</p><p>Wild-type huntingtin exists primarily as a soluble cytoplasmic protein in somatodendritic regions and in axons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/4,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,35</a>]. It is associated with cellular organelles including the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoskeleton, and synaptic vesicles, and is also present to a lesser degree in the nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Although it is essential for normal embryonic development, the role of wild-type huntingtin in the adult is poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Huntingtin interacts with numerous proteins, raising the possibility that huntingtin is involved in multiple cellular events. Proposed functions for wild-type huntingtin include roles in the regulation of ciliogenesis, protein trafficking, vesicular transport and anchoring to the cytoskeleton, endocytosis, and postsynaptic signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,36-38</a>].

A key neuropathologic feature of HD is selective neuronal loss in the caudate and putamen (striatum).</p><p>In HD, electron microscopy reveals both cytoplasmic and nuclear abnormalities, including the presence of large neuronal intranuclear inclusions or aggregates similar to those in other polyglutamine disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. The aggregates are also found in dystrophic neurites. The aggregates consist of amino-terminus fragments of the expanded mutant huntingtin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44</a>]. The degree of aggregation varies with the length of the polyglutamine expansion (ie, the number of CAG repeats) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Formation of mutant huntingtin aggregates may occur by one or both of two proposed mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal tertiary protein conformation of huntingtin may be destabilized by the presence of the expanded polyglutamine tract, leading to the formation of insoluble beta pleated sheets</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The expanded polyglutamine tract may result in increased transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking with other polyglutamine-containing proteins, including mutant and wild-type huntingtin</p><p/><p>While aggregation of mutant huntingtin is a pathologic hallmark of the disease process, the precise role of aggregates in the pathogenesis of HD is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,45-47</a>]. As discussed below, the interaction of Rhes with mutant huntingtin results in both neurotoxicity and diminished aggregation of mutant huntingtin. This finding suggests that aggregation is a protective rather than a deleterious mechanism. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Rhes'</a> below.)</p><p>Experimental evidence consistently shows that the phenotypic severity of HD is directly related to levels of mutant huntingtin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This concept has promoted therapeutic efforts to reduce and even reverse HD pathology and symptoms by inhibiting huntingtin expression or by altering its clearance. This approach is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-management#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Investigational therapies'</a>.)</p><p>Although the pathophysiology of neuronal loss is incompletely understood, there is evidence that mutant huntingtin may disrupt a number of intracellular pathways and thereby cause cellular demise by interfering with key components of these pathways <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by sequestrating of normal proteins into the huntingtin aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Proteins and pathways that are potentially disrupted by mutant huntingtin include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcription disruption. One study showed that mutant huntingtin binds to and inhibits specificity protein 1 (Sp1), a transcription factor for cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), thereby leading to depletion of CSE, an enzyme necessary for the biosynthesis of the amino acid cysteine in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Furthermore, profoundly low levels of CSE were found in the striatum in mouse models of HD and in humans with HD; supplementation with cysteine reduced cytotoxicity in cell cultures of HD tissue and improved motor outcomes and survival in live mouse models of HD.
