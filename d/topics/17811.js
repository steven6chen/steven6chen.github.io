(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>MN in adults is most often idiopathic (approximately 75 percent of cases) but can be caused by a variety of drugs, infections, and underlying diseases. These include gold, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>, systemic lupus erythematosus, malignancy, and hepatitis B and C virus infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80418 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>It is often not possible to distinguish idiopathic from secondary MN on clinical grounds alone, even though serologic studies (eg, antinuclear antibodies, hepatitis B serology) and a history of drug exposure or cancer may be revealing of a potential cause. However, there are certain findings on electron microscopy and immunofluorescence that suggest secondary disease. In patients with secondary MN, cessation of the offending drug or effective treatment of the underlying disease is usually associated with improvement in the nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of idiopathic MN, beginning with a review of the natural history and risk factors for progressive disease, will be presented here. The clinical trials supporting the efficacy of initial immunosuppressive regimens and the effectiveness of alternative agents in unresponsive patients are discussed in detail separately.

The incidence of spontaneous remission increased over time.

This observation is typical of most glomerular diseases.

Thus, although tubulointerstitial disease severity is associated with reduced renal survival, it may not predict this outcome independent of baseline clinical variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Importance of attaining remission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attainment of a complete remission (whether spontaneous or not) is associated with good long-term outcomes. In contrast, little is known about the prognosis in patients with a partial remission.</p><p>The prognostic importance of attaining remission was best evaluated in a study cohort of 348 patients with nephrotic syndrome due to idiopathic MN from Toronto: 39 percent received no immunosuppressive therapy, 45 percent received one immunosuppressive drug, and 16 percent received combined immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A complete remission was defined as protein excretion below 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> while a partial remission was defined as protein excretion below 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> plus a 50 percent or greater reduction in protein excretion from the peak value (for example, a patient with a peak value of 8.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> who experiences a decline to a value of 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> has not experienced a remission). Renal failure was defined as a creatinine clearance &le;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> initiation of dialysis, or renal transplantation. Five patients had renal failure at initial assessment and were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Over the five-year mean observation period, a complete, partial, or no remission was realized in 102, 136, and 110 patients (29, 39, and 32 percent), respectively. The mean time to complete remission was 30 months, and the mean time to partial remission was 23 months.</p><p>At a median follow-up of five years, the following findings were associated with a better renal survival on multivariate analysis that took into account clinical and laboratory data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher initial creatinine clearance and lower proteinuria at presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower mean arterial blood pressure over the observation period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attainment of complete or partial remission in proteinuria.

Of these variables, the initial creatinine clearance and the rate of change of clearance were the most useful predictors.</p><p>Based upon this approach, the best fitting logistic model utilized the following clinical characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent proteinuria for over six months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creatinine clearance upon presentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slope of the decline in creatinine clearance over the assessed proteinuria period</p><p/><p>The addition of renal pathology as a variable had no effect on the performance of the model.</p><p>This model was tested in two additional populations of patients identified through the Italian Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy Study group (110 patients) and a database obtained from Helsinki University (84 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The accuracy in predicting the development of chronic renal insufficiency was 85, 87, and 79 percent in populations from Toronto, Finland, and Italy, respectively.

Approximately 75 percent of such patients are at risk of progression to chronic renal insufficiency over five years.</p><p/><p>This risk stratification applies only to the likelihood of progressive renal failure. It does not take into account the risks that may be associated with other complications of the nephrotic syndrome, such as worsening atherosclerosis due to hypercholesterolemia and thromboemboli due to the associated hypercoagulable state. Thus, in addition to preservation of renal function, immunosuppressive therapy may be beneficial by shortening the overall exposure to the nephrotic state, thereby minimizing the risk of other complications.

Patients who had a decline in anti-PLA2R were more likely to achieve remission compared with those in whom the level of anti-PLA2 antibodies did not change (59 versus 0 percent, respectively at 12 months and 88 versus 33 percent, respectively at 24 months). One patient who relapsed had a return of anti-PLA2R antibodies prior to the onset of proteinuria. The lag-time between disappearance of circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies and a remission of proteinuria may help to explain why only about 75 to 80 percent of patients with idiopathic MN are positive for anti-PLA2R antibody in cross-sectional studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>].

The choice between a cytotoxic-based or calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen depends primarily upon clinician and patient preference, after a thorough discussion of the potential benefits and risks. As an example, calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy may be preferred among those who elect to avoid toxicity of cytotoxic agents, such as the risk of decreased fertility. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Summary of moderate risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a cytotoxic-based therapy is chosen, we recommend a cyclophosphamide-based regimen rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> because of a lower rate of side effects (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

As an example, tacrolimus may be preferred among those who wish to avoid some of the side effects commonly observed with cyclosporine, such as hirsutism or gingival hypertrophy.

The dosing regimens are the same as those described for initial therapy, as tolerated. For patients initially treated with cytotoxic therapy, we usually wait three to six months after the cessation of cytotoxic therapy before initiating a calcineurin inhibitor, unless the patient has severe symptoms or a rise in serum creatinine secondary to active MN.
