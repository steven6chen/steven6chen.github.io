The originally described features of WAS include susceptibility to infections (subsequently associated with adaptive and innate immune deficiency), microthrombocytopenia, and eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, there is a wide spectrum of disease severity due to <em>WAS</em> gene mutations, ranging from severe phenotype (classic form) of WAS associated with bacterial and viral infections, severe eczema autoimmunity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malignancy to a milder form characterized by thrombocytopenia and less severe or sometimes absent infections and eczema, called X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), to X-linked neutropenia (XLN).</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of WAS, XLT, and XLN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6866590\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WAS is a rare syndrome with an estimated incidence of approximately 1:100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an X-linked disorder, it is seen almost exclusively in males. Approximately 50 percent of patients with <em>WAS</em> gene mutations have the WAS phenotype, and the other half have the X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) phenotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58264 \">figure 2</a>). <em>WAS</em> gene mutations causing X-linked neutropenia (XLN) are very rare, with &lt;12 patients in four families reported to date. (See <a href=\"#H24194157\" class=\"local\">'Clinical phenotypes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22657964\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is a member of a distinct family of proteins that link signaling pathways to actin cytoskeleton reorganization by activating actin polymerization mediated by actin-related protein <span class=\"nowrap\">(Arp)-2/3</span>. The WASp family of proteins is characterized by a C-terminal domain containing a common actin monomer-binding motif, a verprolin homology domain, a central acidic region that is capable of binding and activating the <span class=\"nowrap\">Arp-2/3</span> complex, and an N-terminal domain containing the pleckstrin <span class=\"nowrap\">homology/enabled</span> VASP homology 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(PH/EVH1)</span> domain and the WASP interacting protein (WIP) binding region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>WASp is expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm of hematopoietic cells and plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Its absence impacts the formation of the immunologic synapse, the site of interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] that depends upon the generation of so-called lipid rafts, which provide a platform to recruit crucial molecules to ensure the stability of the immunologic synapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, T cell function is defective due to abnormal cytoskeletal reorganization, leading to impaired migration and adhesion and insufficient interaction with other cells due to abnormal synapse formation. B cell homeostasis is perturbed due to the abnormalities in T cell function, resulting in the selective depletion of circulating mature B cells, splenic marginal zone precursors, and marginal zone B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The phenomenon of lymphocyte numbers declining over time is possibly due to accelerated cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Circulating natural killer (NK) cell numbers are normal or increased, but cytotoxicity of WASp-deficient NK cells is impaired as a result of defective immune synapse formation on the cell surface, a process requiring WASp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) can, at least in part, restore cytotoxicity in NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] by inducing expression of a functionally related protein, WASp family verprolin-homologous 2 (WAVE2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are thought to play an important role in protection against autoimmunity and in cancer immunosurveillance. These iNKT cells are completely absent in patients with WAS and reduced in patients with X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In mice, WASp is required for late-stage thymic iNKT cell development and egress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>WASp-deficient humans and mice have regulatory T (Treg) cells that fail to suppress effector cells in vitro and that are incapable of controlling autoimmunity in several mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. While WASp does not seem to be required for the thymic generation of natural Treg cells, it appears to play a crucial role in peripheral homeostasis of these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The suppressive effect of Tregs on effector T cells requires direct cell-to-cell contact. The failure of WASp-deficient Tregs to form synapses with effector T cells may explain their decreased function.</p><p>WASp-deficient myeloid lineage cells exhibit impaired phagocytosis and chemotaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In addition, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells from WASp-deficient patients and mice demonstrate almost completely abrogated assembly of podosomes (actin-rich structures on the outer surface of cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]; the formation of lamellipodia (sheet-like, actin-containing extensions) and filopodia (hairlike projects [microspikes] that extend beyond the leading edge of the lamellipodia) at the migrating edge of macrophages and dendritic cells is defective; and chemotaxis to specific chemoattractants is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>]. Defective migration and homing of several cell lineages may be a significant pathogenic mechanism in WAS.</p><p>Thrombocytopenia has been explained by increased clearance, ineffective thrombocytopoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], reduced platelet survival due to intrinsic platelet abnormalities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immune-mediated events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Mechanisms for the high incidence of autoimmunity in WAS include inadequate Treg cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>], B cell-intrinsic loss of tolerance via positive selection of self-reactive transitional B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], expansion of autoreactive B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and production of autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis of self-reactive lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and defective phagocytosis of apoptotic cells resulting in chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Whereas &quot;loss-of-function&quot; mutations in the <em>WAS</em> gene cause either XLT or WAS, unique &quot;gain-of-function&quot; missense mutations in the guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42)-binding domain of WASp impair the autoinhibitory conformation of the molecule and lead to increased actin polymerization, resulting in congenital neutropenia. (See <a href=\"#H24194157\" class=\"local\">'Clinical phenotypes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24194150\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations of the <em>WAS</em> gene on the X chromosome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58264 \">figure 2</a>) are responsible not only for classic WAS, but also for X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) and, in rare instances, congenital X-linked neutropenia (XLN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Homozygous mutations of the <em>WIPF1</em> gene on chromosome 2, which encodes WAS protein (WASp)-interacting protein (WIP), a cytoplasmic protein required to stabilize WASp, can also cause a WAS phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">WAS/XLT/XLN</span> have in common mutations in the <em>WAS</em> gene, located on the short arm of the X chromosome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a>). The <em>WAS</em> gene consists of 12 exons spanning approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and encodes a 502 amino acid protein, designated WASp. Many different <em>WAS</em> gene mutations can cause WAS, although several mutational hotspots have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a>). Certain types of mutations at particular locations are more likely to cause XLT than classic WAS, and mutations in the cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42)-binding domain (GTPase-binding domain, GBD) result in XLN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58264 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The analysis of affected members of 270 unrelated WAS families from three large referral centers (United States, Italy, Japan) revealed a total of 158 unique <em>WAS</em> gene mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Most common were missense mutations, followed by splice-site mutations, short deletions, and nonsense mutations. Insertions, complex mutations, and large deletions were less frequent. Most deletions and insertions involved fewer than 10 nucleotides, resulting in frame shift and early termination of transcription. Amino acid substitutions are typically located in exons 1 to 4.</p><p>Splice-site mutations occur predominantly in the downstream half of the <em>WAS</em> gene (introns 6 to 11) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58264 \">figure 2</a>). Mutations affecting variant splice sites may result in multiple splicing products, which often include normal amounts of <em>WAS</em> gene cDNA (eg, c.559+5G&gt;A).</p><p>Six mutational hotspots, defined as occurring in &gt;2.5 percent of the <span class=\"nowrap\">WAS/XLT</span> population, have been identified. Three of these hotspots represent point mutations (T45M; <span class=\"nowrap\">R86C/H/L/S;</span> R211X) within the coding regions, whereas the other three involve splice sites (c.559+5G&gt;A; c.777+1G&gt;N; c.777+1 to 6 del GTGA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These six hotspot mutations accounted for 25.6 percent of the entire cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>Spontaneous somatic reversions of the causative mutations restore WASp expression in a fraction of the lymphocytes in up to 10 percent of patients with WAS. Somatic reversions and mosaicism observed in patients with classic WAS usually affect natural killer (NK) cells and differentiated T cell subsets, most often CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but do not seem to influence the clinical phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Thus, the clinical benefit observed in association with reversion and expansion of reverted lymphocytes is minimal at best [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24194157\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PHENOTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the <em>WAS</em> gene result in variable clinical phenotypes that correlate with the type of mutation and its effect on WAS protein (WASp) expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Affected patients are categorized into three major groups: classic WAS, X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), and X-linked neutropenia (XLN) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69089 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>While there is a considerable <span class=\"nowrap\">phenotype/genotype</span> correlation, there are exceptions, making it difficult in individual cases to accurately predict the clinical course based solely on the type of mutations of the <em>WAS</em> gene. The most consistent <span class=\"nowrap\">phenotype/genotype</span> correlation is observed when patients are divided into two categories: WASp<sup>+</sup> for patients whose mutated, nonfunctional protein is expressed, although often in reduced quantities, and of normal size, and WASp<sup>-</sup> for patients whose mutated protein is absent or truncated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Patients with mutations that allow the expression of normal-sized mutated protein develop the XLT phenotype, with few exceptions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58264 \">figure 2</a>). In contrast, patients with lymphocytes that do not express WASp or express only truncated WASp are more likely to have the classic WAS phenotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A WAS disease severity scoring system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69089 \">table 1</a>) facilitates the clinical categorization of patients and may be useful in predicting disease severity and outcome of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The clinical phenotype of the disease evolves over time and is often incomplete in boys younger than two years of age. Thus, WAS scores should not be used to predict disease severity in infancy.</p><p>A score of 1 or 2 defines patients with XLT, a score of 3 to 4 identifies patients with classic WAS, and a score of 5 is reserved for patients with either XLT or WAS who develop autoimmunity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malignancies. A modified score also assigns a score of 5 to patients with severe refractory thrombocytopenia since these patients are at increased risk for hemorrhage with associated morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, progression of the disease can occur at a later age. Thus, some patients originally diagnosed with XLT (score of 1 to 2) may develop autoimmunity or cancer later in life (score of 5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The WAS score reflects the severity of the clinical phenotype without taking into account the type of mutation or whether WASp is expressed. However, most patients with missense mutations in exon 1, 2, and 3 of the <em>WAS</em> gene express mutated, nonfunctional WASp, often in decreased amounts, and tend to have a milder disease phenotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58264 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/38,39,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9446788\"><span class=\"h2\">X-linked neutropenia (XLN)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>XLN is one of several distinct entities presenting as severe, congenital neutropenia.

Eczema, if present, is mild.

XLT must be differentiated from immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which does <strong>not</strong> have an increased risk of malignancies. Any male with thrombocytopenia and small platelets should be evaluated for WASp expression and <em>WAS</em> gene mutations.

These manipulated cells are then reinfused into the same patient after conditioning with submyeloablative doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine if this experimental therapy is safe and will result in long-term cure, as is the case for HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The first retroviral-based gene therapy trial involved two patients and resulted in sustained expression of WASp in hematopoietic stem cells, lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and platelets and functional correction of T, B, and NK cells and monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. The condition of both patients markedly improved, with resolution of hemorrhagic diathesis (although platelets remained somewhat low), eczema, autoimmunity, and predisposition to severe infection. Eight additional WAS patients subsequently underwent retroviral-based gene therapy at the same site (Hannover, Germany). One patient with insufficient gene-treated cells failed to respond and underwent successful HCT. Seven of the remaining nine successfully corrected patients developed leukemia (four patients affected with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [T-ALL], two with T-ALL and secondary acute myeloid leukemia [AML], and one with primary AML). The dominant clones revealed vector integration at the LM02, MDS1, and MN1 loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>Lentiviral-based gene therapy trials were subsequently initiated, with early reports showing encouraging results. All three WAS patients receiving autologous gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cells (using a lentiviral vector under the endogenous promoter) after reduced-intensity myeloablative conditioning showed WASp expression in myeloid and lymphoid cells and platelets. They were protected from bleeding, severe infections, and eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. In a more recent report, seven patients who underwent this form of gene therapy for WAS were alive at a median follow-up of 27 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. One patient died from a pre-existing herpes virus infection that was drug resistant. All surviving patients demonstrated sustained clinical benefit, with resolved eczema and susceptibility to infections and improved autoimmunity and manifestations of thrombocytopenia. No evidence of lymphoproliferative disease was seen in the surviving patients of either of the two clinical trials. One report illustrated the safety and success of this procedure in a 30-year-old patient with WAS with severe manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Following gene therapy, the B cell compartment was repopulated, B cell subsets were normally distributed, and serum immunoglobulin levels normalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Lentiviral-mediated gene therapy restored B cell tolerance in a group of patients with WAS assessed before and after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27996912\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life expectancy of patients with classic WAS is reduced, with premature death resulting from infections, hemorrhage, autoimmune disease, and malignancies. Bleeding is the main cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wiskott-aldrich-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H24194143\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>WAS protein (WASp) is a member of a distinct family of proteins that link signaling pathways to actin cytoskeleton reorganization. &quot;Loss-of-function&quot; mutations of the <em>WAS</em> gene are responsible not only for classic WAS, but also for X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66996 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58264 \">figure 2</a>). More rarely, &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mutations result in congenital X-linked neutropenia (XLN). (See <a href=\"#H24194150\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phenotype originally described by Wiskott is often referred to as classic WAS. Affected boys present in early childhood with hemorrhagic diathesis due to thrombocytopenia; recurrent bacterial, viral and fungal infections; and extensive eczema. Patients with classic WAS tend to develop autoimmune disorders and lymphoma or other malignancies, leading to early death. (See <a href=\"#H9446559\" class=\"local\">'Classic (severe) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>XLT is a less severe variant of WAS that presents with congenital thrombocytopenia, sometimes intermittently, and mild, if any, eczema. The disease course is generally benign, although these patients still carry an increased risk for severe events such as life-threatening infections (especially postsplenectomy), serious hemorrhage, autoimmunity, and cancer. (See <a href=\"#H24194171\" class=\"local\">'X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with XLN (congenital neutropenia) present with infections characteristic for neutropenia but may also develop infections associated with lymphocyte dysfunction and are at increased risk for myelodysplasia. (See <a href=\"#H9446788\" class=\"local\">'X-linked neutropenia (XLN)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">WAS/XLT</span> should be considered in any male patient presenting with petechiae, bruises, and congenital or early-onset thrombocytopenia associated with small platelet size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78822\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78822 \">table 2</a>). Screening for WASp expression is performed by flow cytometry using an anti-WASp antibody. However, this testing may miss patients with expression of mutated, nonfunctional WASp. Sequence analysis of the <em>WAS</em> gene is essential to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H24194227\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional treatment and supportive care include the use of prophylactic antimicrobials and platelet transfusions to stop life-threatening hemorrhages. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) therapy is indicated in patients with significant antibody deficiency. Immunosuppressive treatment may be required for autoimmune manifestations. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is presently the only available curative treatment, but gene therapy is under investigation and is showing promising results. (See <a href=\"#H24194255\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life expectancy of patients with classic WAS is reduced, with premature death resulting from infections, hemorrhage, autoimmune disease, and malignancies. In contrast, life expectancy of patients with XLT is near normal.
