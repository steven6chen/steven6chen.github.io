Respiratory failure is common after acute SCI and in persons with chronic SCI who develop respiratory illnesses.

In a Canadian study assessing hospitalization in the year following discharge, 27.5 percent of persons with SCI were rehospitalized at least once, and 11.5 percent of the hospitalizations were attributed to a respiratory cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In the US, overall rates of hospitalization 5 to 20 years after injury were approximately 20 to 25 percent, with 8.1 percent attributable to diseases of the respiratory system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Pulmonary complications are most common immediately following acute SCI and decrease in the months to years after SCI. Most studies find that the likelihood of complications depends on the level and completeness of SCI, with a greater risk in persons with higher and neurologically more complete SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, in a prospective cohort study of a subset of persons with SCI who had survived at least one year (mean survival 17 years) and were not receiving chronic mechanical ventilation or have a tracheostomy, the level and completeness of SCI were not associated with an increased risk of future respiratory illness, hospitalization for cardiac or pulmonary causes, or decline in pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Independent risk factors for respiratory illness assessed prospectively include a lower percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), smoking history, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and history of pneumonia or bronchitis since SCI (RR = 2.29; 1.40-3.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. These findings demonstrate the importance of including the contribution of risk factors known to be related to respiratory health (smoking history, reduced pulmonary function, COPD), including a previous history of pneumonia or bronchitis, in the assessment of respiratory health in persons with chronic SCI. </p><p>Depending on the study, respiratory diseases are the first or second (after circulatory diseases) most common underlying cause of death in the years following SCI, accounting for up to 20 to 30 percent of the mortality that occurs beyond the first year after SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].

The extent of ventilatory muscle impairment depends upon the level and severity of SCI; ventilatory impairment is most common and severe in complete cervical cord lesions, but also prevalent in thoracic cord lesions.

In addition, injuries associated with blunt chest trauma and acute aspiration may contribute to respiratory insufficiency. The assessment of the level of SCI, associated ventilatory deficits, injuries associated with blunt chest trauma, the decision to intubate, and the timing of tracheostomy are discussed separately.

In the absence of data to the contrary, we follow the general guidelines for mechanical ventilation and adjust as needed based on underlying lung disease and degree of acute illness, dyspnea, and arterial blood gas results. When the tracheal tube cuff is deflated to facilitate speech, the tidal volume is typically increased to compensate for air leakage around the cuff. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A controversial area is whether to set the ventilator to deliver high or low tidal volumes to facilitate weaning after an episode of respiratory failure. One hypothesis is that the profound respiratory muscle weakness of cervical SCI leads to atelectasis even during mechanical ventilation and that this propensity is offset by use of high tidal volumes. Thus, it has been clinical practice at many SCI centers to ventilate persons with cervical or high thoracic SCI at tidal volumes of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> predicted body weight (PBW) or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87507 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87147 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/7,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22-24</a>]. This practice also reflects our clinical experience and that of others in which tidal volumes &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW have been associated with recurrent atelectasis. However, among case series that reported fewer respiratory complications with tidal volumes of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> or greater, an uncuffed tracheostomy tube was typically in place which would have resulted in a substantial air leak and lower effective tidal volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>]. Further study is needed to reconcile these observations with the large body of evidence in ventilated patients without SCI suggesting that lower tidal volumes (eg, 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW) reduce the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventilator-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventilator-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A limitation of assessing the efficacy of a particular approach has been a lack of sufficiently powered trials in the SCI population. For example, in one trial, 118 subjects with SCI within the prior six months were screened and only 34 were randomized to tidal volumes of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> or 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> in a two week weaning protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There was no difference in median days to wean, ventilator associated pneumonia, or atelectasis. Therefore, in order to balance the goals of avoiding atelectasis and ventilator-associated lung injury in patients with SCI-associated respiratory failure but otherwise normal lungs, we typically aim for a tidal volume of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW. For patients who have recurrent atelectasis despite meticulous airway clearance techniques (see <a href=\"#H227227882\" class=\"local\">'Chest physiotherapy'</a> below), we increase the tidal volume by 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per breath in increments, ensuring that the plateau (end-inspiratory) pressure is &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. High tidal volume ventilation often results in a low arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), so additional tubing (eg, 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> may be needed to increase dead space and maintain the PaCO<sub>2</sub> close to 35 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults#H1064990298\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Some evidence suggests that tetraplegic patients may experience more dyspnea when ventilated at lower tidal volumes (eg, &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW), although this has only been assessed in a small number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other factors such as inspiratory flow rate, mucus plugging, and gas exchange should be assessed and corrected as needed. &#160;</p><p>Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a standard method to prevent atelectasis in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the optimal PEEP in persons with respiratory failure due to SCI is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]. We typically use 0 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP, unless the patient has complicating ARDS. PEEP is usually discontinued when the tracheal cuff is deflated to allow speech during the day. Excessive PEEP may result in flattening of the diaphragm and lower its position in the chest, resulting in a mechanical disadvantage during inspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep#H11865118\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689173\"><span class=\"h2\">Weaning from the ventilator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improvements in pulmonary muscle function over the weeks following SCI are due to functional descent of the neurologic injury level as spinal cord inflammation resolves, enhanced recruitment of accessory ventilatory muscles, retraining of deconditioned muscles, and the evolution from flaccid paralysis (known as spinal shock) to spastic paralysis. As the intercostal and abdominal muscles become less flaccid, rib cage stabilization improves. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation in 186 patients with acute cervical SCI was three to four weeks in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, ongoing attempts at weaning from mechanical ventilation are appropriate and often successful in the weeks to months after SCI, except for patients with high cervical cord lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult-to-wean adult patient in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Protocols describing an approach to weaning the patient with cervical and high thoracic SCI (and stable respiratory status) suggest an approach of gradually increasing periods of ventilator-free breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25</a>]. The accuracy of weaning predictors (eg, rapid shallow breathing index) in predicting weaning success has not been specifically addressed in this patient population, and we typically follow standard clinical criteria for weaning, as described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62377 \">table 3</a>). During the ventilator-free breathing (VFB) trials, agitation, respiratory rate, heart rate, and pulse oxygen saturation are monitored; an increase in respiratory rate and a fall vital capacity (eg, one-half to two-thirds of the starting value) are indicators of poor tolerance of VFB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>].

In addition to adjusting tidal volume as noted above, meticulous attention to chest physiotherapy is essential. In addition to routine times of chest physiotherapy (eg, manually-assisted cough, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation, endotracheal suctioning), chest physiotherapy is used to clear the airways of secretions in preparation for each weaning effort. (See <a href=\"#H227227882\" class=\"local\">'Chest physiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patient position during weaning trials is also important. In motor complete cervical SCI, weaning tends to be more successful with the patient in a more recumbent position as the diaphragm is higher in the chest, due to pressure from the abdominal contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The higher the diaphragm is in the chest, the more effective its contraction. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) are higher in persons with cervical SCI when supine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6116876\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory muscle training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory muscle training typically involves inspiration or expiration through a device with a narrow orifice or against resistance once or twice a day, five to six days a week. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been evaluated as an adjunct to weaning from mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/6,7,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,31,32</a>]. Systematic reviews of IMT in mechanically ventilated patients without SCI have found improved respiratory muscle strength, but insufficient evidence to determine whether the improvement in muscle strength leads to a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In patients with SCI, systematic reviews have similarly found an improvement in respiratory muscle strength, as assessed by improved peak maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and vital capacity, but data are insufficient to conclude a benefit in weaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/31,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,34</a>]. </p><p>Given the lack of adverse effects and the theoretical advantages of improved strength, one center describes using IMT once patients are able to tolerate a few minutes without ventilatory support. IMT may be initiated with an inspiratory resistance of 7 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for up to one minute initially, twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The level of resistance, duration, and frequency of treatment are increased as strength improves. To maintain any improvement in strength, it is necessary to continue training, as with any muscle strengthening program.</p><p>Further research is needed to clarify whether inspiratory muscle training improves weaning outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690096258\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term assisted ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain categories of patients with SCI will require ongoing assistance with ventilation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2674895\"><span class=\"h3\">Cervical cord injury with bulbar muscle weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with cervical SCI are unable to wean from assisted ventilation, particularly those with high cervical cord injury that affects the lower cranial nerves at the craniocervical junction. These high cervical cord injuries impair bulbar function (causing weakness of pharyngeal and palatal muscles) and cause recurrent aspiration of saliva and inability to protect the airway. In addition, these patients are unable to maintain a pulse oxygen saturation of 95 percent or greater despite optimal use of noninvasive ventilation and mechanically assisted cough because of ongoing saliva aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

At night, NPPV can be delivered via nasal, oronasal, or lip-seal interfaces with a conventional ventilator. During the day, some patients are able to breathe independently. Otherwise, a 15-mm angled mouth piece may be used as an interface with the ventilator to better enable speech. The angled mouthpiece can be kept in the mouth or fixed near the mouth for frequent, but intermittent use. Alternatively, patients can use a nasal interface during the day and prevent excessive oral leakage by closing their mouth or pressing their tongue against the soft palate.

We also use this device in our intensive care unit for patients with spinal cord injury to assist with mucus clearance as required clinically, particularly during weaning after acute pulmonary infections. Although potential complications of insufflation-exsufflation include abdominal distention, adverse effects are rarely reported. The measurement of cough velocity (&lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/sec)</span> has been suggested to screen for persons who may benefit from the MIE for chronic use, but usually the need is determined based on clinical behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

In one study, a respiratory health questionnaire was used to assess the relationship of degree of injury and dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. Among 130 adult males with neurologically complete motor SCI who used a hand-propelled wheelchair greater than 50 percent of the time, those with tetraplegia reported breathlessness more frequently (21 to 33 percent) than those with high thoracic (9 to 15 percent) or lower injury levels (2 to 11 percent). The report of dyspnea was independent of obesity, smoking, age, and years since SCI. &#160;</p><p>However, the prevalence of dyspnea does not always correlate with the level of SCI, suggesting that the perception of dyspnea may be abnormal in tetraplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is illustrated by the observation that similar percentages (10 to 15 percent) of subjects with cervical SCI, high paraplegia, and low paraplegia reported the need to &quot;stop to catch their breath&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. </p><p>Dyspnea can limit activities of daily life to a variable extent. In a study of 441 motorized wheelchair users with chronic SCI, dyspnea was associated with talking (18 percent), eating (5 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">dressing/undressing</span> (2 percent), or leaving the house (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. In this group, the risk of breathlessness was not attributable to lower pulmonary function (eg, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second). It is thought that the high rate of breathlessness during talking may be related to difficulty interrupting breathing to manipulate phrasing, volume, rate, and intensity of speech. In a separate study, dressing was associated with dyspnea in 12 percent of those with SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].

Adjusting for smoking, neurological level, and history of obstructive lung disease, non-athletes were 2.3 times more likely to report breathlessness than athletes, although this finding was of borderline significance. This relationship persisted when adjusted for percent predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and maximal expiratory and inspiratory pressures. In a study of 347 individuals able to walk or use a manual wheelchair who were recruited from five SCI centers in the United States, adjusting for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(COPD)/asthma</span> history and mobility mode, participation in a planned exercise program was also associated with less dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. These findings suggest an effect of exercise on reducing report of dyspnea that is not attributable to be improvement in respiratory muscle performance, pulmonary function, or underlying pulmonary disease. </p><p>A systematic review of inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle training in cervical SCI found improved pulmonary function, but no improvement in dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

This may be due to a combination of worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, upper airway narrowing, and REM-related inhibition of inspiratory muscle contraction.

Many patients compensate for expiratory muscle weakness by inhaling maximally (sometimes with use of glossopharyngeal breaths) to initiate speech at the highest possible lung volume. This pattern of ventilation is probably chosen to optimize the recoil pressure of the respiratory system and produce maximal flow across the vocal cords.</p><p>In mechanically ventilated patients, a fenestrated, cuffed tracheostomy tube should be used whenever possible to allow voice communication. While the use of a fenestrated tube <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deflation of the cuff can result in a significant loss of tidal volume through the mouth, the inspired tidal volume can be increased in order to compensate. Patients can minimize the tidal volume leak by controlling glottal patency and by using accessory muscles of ventilation. However, because these compensatory mechanisms are lost during sleep, the inner cannula should be inserted (thereby occluding the fenestration) and the cuff inflated during sleep. We prefer to make adjustments in ventilator delivered breaths, rather than using a &quot;speaking valve&quot;, a one-way inspiratory valve inserted between the tracheostomy tube and the ventilator. Speaking valves carry a high risk of asphyxiation if the tracheal tube cuff is not deflated prior to insertion of the valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tracheostomy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tracheostomy&quot;, section on 'Patient communication'</a>.)</p><p>Patients can phonate during most of ventilator-driven inhalation and the early part of exhalation when a fenestrated tracheostomy tube is in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The change to speaking during inhalation rather than during exhalation takes some practice. The time available for speech during each breath is often short and accompanied by a long intervening period of silence, which makes it difficult to partake in activities such as group conversation or using a telephone. The fraction of each breath available for phonation can be increased by decreasing the inspiratory flow rate and adding positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); these interventions prolong the period during which tracheal pressures exceed supraglottic pressures and produce usable airflow over the vocal cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/6,131,132\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,131,132</a>].

Mechanical ventilation is usually continued via a tracheostomy for patients with impaired bulbar function. Patients with lower cervical cord tetraplegia may need ventilatory support for a few days to weeks, but can eventually wean from mechanical ventilation to independent breathing or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, as long as bulbar function is intact.

We believe that chest physiotherapy is standard care for the prevention of atelectasis and pneumonia in patients with cervical or thoracic SCI. Chest physiotherapy typically includes encouragement of deep breathing, manually-assisted coughing (&quot;quad cough&quot;), and frequent use of a mechanical insufflator-exsufflator, including at home. We recommend vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus for all patients with respiratory impairment due to SCI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

We prefer use of low-molecular-weight heparin. For those in whom there is a contraindication to anticoagulant prophylaxis, we suggest mechanical methods including intermittent pneumatic devices <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> graduated compression stockings with prompt transition to pharmacologic prophylaxis once the contraindication has resolved. We individualize the duration of therapy with a view to longer durations (8 to 12 weeks) particularly in those whose mobility is limited or in whom additional risk factors are present. Following rehabilitation, most patients do not need venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis unless they are rehospitalized for an acute illness. (See <a href=\"#H227227567\" class=\"local\">'Venous thromboembolism'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-acutely-ill-hospitalized-medical-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with chronic SCI, those with tetraplegia due to high cervical SCI report breathlessness with activity more frequently than do those with low paraplegia (45 versus 25 percent).

Sleep apnea is more common in patients who are obese and those with a higher level of cord injury, but other risk factors may be more important.
