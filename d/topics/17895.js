Surgery is curative <strong>only</strong> in patients with unilateral disease. Although surgery is the preferred approach, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), when given at an appropriate dosage, are an alternative in patients who are not candidates for or who decline surgery.

Unilateral adrenalectomy in these patients induces a marked reduction in aldosterone secretion and correction of the hypokalemia in almost all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14</a>]. Hypertension is improved in all and is cured in approximately 35 to 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/6,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13-17</a>].</p><p>We suggest laparoscopic adrenalectomy (by an experienced endocrine surgeon) over open adrenalectomy because it is associated with shorter hospital stays and fewer complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>We also suggest resection of the entire affected adrenal gland rather than a laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy (removal of an adenoma, leaving the remaining gland intact). Partial adrenalectomy has been tried as a strategy to further reduce surgical morbidity, but it is an inadequate procedure in many cases. This was illustrated in a series of 92 patients with primary aldosteronism undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Postoperatively, all 63 patients with total adrenalectomy had improved blood pressure and normal plasma aldosterone, while 2 of 29 with partial adrenalectomy had persistent hypertension and high plasma aldosterone. Of the 63 removed adrenal glands, 17 (27 percent) contained multiple nodules along with what was thought to be the hypersecretory adenoma. Using sensitive pathologic methods, zona glomerulosa hyperplasia and nodules were observed adjacent to the resected aldosteronoma in 17 of 25 (68 percent) of cases studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>These findings were further confirmed in a study of 55 patients with primary aldosteronism who underwent adrenalectomy; three (5.5 percent) had persistent hyperaldosteronism postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. All three patients had undergone partial adrenalectomy to remove a computed tomography (CT)-detected nodule present on the same side with adrenal vein sampling (AVS) lateralization. However, in the two cases with available data, immunohistochemistry showed a CYP11B2-negative nodule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, CT-detected adrenal nodules are not always a source of aldosterone excess, even when ipsilateral with AVS lateralization. In addition, genetic causes of hyperplasia cannot be excluded easily, so that subtotal adrenalectomy is unlikely to be curative in all patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42309860\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperatively, hypertension should be controlled, and hypokalemia should be corrected with potassium supplementation or a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>). The blood pressure response to spironolactone preoperatively often predicts the blood pressure response to unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with APAs. (See <a href=\"#H42311270\" class=\"local\">'First line: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42309866\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative management after unilateral adrenalectomy should include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma <strong>aldosterone</strong> should be measured the day after surgery to assess for cure. This should be a morning venipuncture, just as is done for the initial evaluation. An undetectable plasma aldosterone concentration confirms correct preoperative subtype assignment and long-term cure (analogous to a low serum cortisol the day after pituitary surgery for Cushing's syndrome, which predicts a long-term cure). However, if the postoperative plasma aldosterone concentration is &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL,</span> the patient should have formal reassessment for possible persistent hyperaldosteronism (eg, aldosterone-to-renin ratio and, if abnormal, aldosterone suppression testing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium supplements and MRA (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>) should be discontinued in all patients, and, if possible, antihypertensive therapy should be decreased. When patients are treated with multiple antihypertensive agents prior to surgery, postoperatively we either discontinue or decrease the doses of those drugs that may predispose to hyperkalemia (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]) and, if needed for blood pressure control, continue those that are potassium neutral (eg, calcium channel blockers).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be monitored closely for <strong>hyperkalemia</strong>, which may result from transient hypoaldosteronism due to chronic suppression of renal renin release and contralateral adrenal gland aldosterone secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serum potassium should be measured during the <strong>hospitalization</strong> and, subsequently as an <strong>outpatient</strong>, once weekly for four weeks. In a retrospective study of 192 patients with surgically treated primary aldosteronism, 12 (6.3 percent) developed hyperkalemia (median serum potassium 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> with a median time to onset of 13.5 days (range 7 to 55 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Four patients received mineralocorticoid replacement therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>. On univariate analysis, hyperkalemic patients had slightly greater preoperative serum creatinine levels (1.2 versus 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> higher postoperative creatinine (1.3 versus 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> lesser median contralateral suppression index (0.14 versus 0.27), and larger adenomas (1.9 versus 1.4 cm). On multivariable logistic regression, the contralateral aldosterone suppression index remained the only significant predictor of postoperative hyperkalemia with an optimal cutoff of &lt;0.47 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another retrospective study of 110 patients with APA who were treated with unilateral adrenalectomy, 12 (11 percent) developed transient postoperative hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Prolonged hyperkalemia was observed in six patients (5 percent), and these patients required mineralocorticoid replacement therapy for 11 to 46 months. Preoperative decreased glomerular filtration rate and increased serum creatinine, as well as increased postoperative creatinine and microalbuminuria, were significant predictors of hyperkalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum <strong>creatinine</strong> should be followed serially in patients who had renal insufficiency preoperatively. Primary aldosteronism has been associated with renal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>], and improvement of hypertension corrects renal hyperfiltration and may unmask the preexisting renal damage. In a long-term study that included 50 patients with primary aldosteronism and 100 patients with primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension), during 30 to 90 days after surgical or medical intervention, the mean glomerular filtration rate decreased in patients with primary aldosteronism by 13.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> but only by 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in patients with primary hypertension despite similar blood pressure values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred intravenous fluid after surgery is isotonic saline without potassium (unless the patient is still hypokalemic), and a sodium-rich diet should be considered before and after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42310096\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42310131\"><span class=\"h4\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although hypertension is cured in some patients, a lesser degree of hypertension persists in as many as 40 to 65 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/13-17,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17,30,31</a>].

It is also possible that an error in subtype assignment has been made and that the patient has bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, a disorder that usually should be treated medically, <strong>not</strong> with unilateral adrenalectomy. If the patient has persistent primary aldosteronism after surgery, it should be treated with an MRA (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>).

If preoperative hypokalemia was present, it should resolve in a matter of days. The concern in the first several weeks after surgery is for hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and resultant hyperkalemia (see <a href=\"#H42309866\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above).

(See <a href=\"#H183241056\" class=\"local\">'Patients with bilateral disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with either bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or confirmed unilateral adrenal aldosterone hypersecretion (who refuse or are not candidates for surgery), we suggest a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>) over other potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamterene</a>) as our first choice for pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H42311270\" class=\"local\">'First line: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the MRAs, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> as the first-line drug (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) and switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a> if side effects are limiting. Eplerenone is a more selective MRA than spironolactone and is associated with fewer side effects; however, when administered once daily and compared with spironolactone, eplerenone is a less effective antihypertensive agent.

If the patient is in the subset of patients who have a remission in the degree of primary aldosteronism, then surgery or treatment with an MRA can be avoided until after delivery. However, if hypertension and hypokalemia are marked, then surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical intervention is indicated.
