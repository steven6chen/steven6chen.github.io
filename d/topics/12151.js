This is an approach to prevention in women at average risk, rather than high risk, for these cancers. Women at high risk of ovarian cancer are typically advised to undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.</p><p>The preventive strategy of opportunistic salpingectomy was introduced in the 2010s. This was based on data regarding the role of fallopian tube in the development of what had previously been presumed to be primary ovarian cancers, as a site of primary carcinogenesis or a conduit for neoplastic cells or carcinogens.</p><p>Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction in average-risk women is reviewed here. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for women at high risk of carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum and the pathogenesis of serous carcinoma of the ovary, tube, and peritoneum are discussed separately.

Ovarian cancer is the second most common type of gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of death from gynecologic cancer. It is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths in women. In the United States and Canada every year, over 25,000 women are newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and 16,000 women die from the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Unfortunately, there are few current approaches to improve clinical outcomes for ovarian cancer. There are no effective screening tests. For women who present with symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer or with an adnexal mass, evaluation with serum biomarkers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic imaging has a low specificity, and many women with a benign adnexal mass undergo unnecessary surgery (in one study, ovarian cancer was found in only 3.5 percent of procedures performed for a suspicious adnexal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].

Despite exciting innovations in surgical practice and chemotherapeutic agents, including targeted and antiangiogenic regimens, the overall survival rate for women with ovarian cancer has remained largely unchanged since the mid-1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Specifically, in British Columbia, since the mid-1980s, minimal improvements of 1, 5, and 4 percent have been observed in the overall one-, three- and five-year survival rates, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>There has been a shift in the understanding of ovarian cancer in two major ways, the different biologic behavior of the histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and the role of the fallopian tube in pathogenesis.</p><p>There is a greater appreciation that ovarian cancer is not a single entity, and that the varied molecular profile and biologic behavior of different histologic subtypes require differing clinical strategies. This variation in clinical behavior poses challenges to effective screening, early detection, and treatment of ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma and may require different approaches based on histology. The most common histologic subtype is high-grade serous (&gt;70 percent of EOCs), which typically presents at stage III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>) and has a poor prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64569 \">table 1</a>). The next most common histologic subtypes are endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas (each at approximately 10 percent). Low-grade serous carcinomas (4 percent) are genomically and biologically distinct from high-grade serous carcinomas and are slow growing with relative insensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. Finally, mucinous carcinomas (less than 4 percent of EOCs) typically present at an early stage and have a different pathogenesis than high-grade serous carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Research has found that high-grade serous carcinomas arise from the epithelium of the distal fallopian tube and may spread to the ovary. These neoplastic cells may also spread to the peritoneum and present as peritoneal carcinoma with no ovarian lesion. Thus, high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinomas are considered to be in the same biologic spectrum and behave similarly in terms of disease distribution, response to treatment, and outcomes.</p><p>Pathology nomenclature has changed in the past several years, evolving from the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of 2003 to the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting criteria for &quot;tubo-ovarian high-grade serous cancer&quot; criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. In addition, in 2014, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics <span class=\"nowrap\">(FIGO)/Tumor,</span> Nodes, Metastases (TNM) classification system merged ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this topic, these high-grade serous entities will be considered together and referred to as high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H23774982\" class=\"local\">'Role of the fallopian tube'</a> below.)</p><p>Given the limitations in screening and treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinoma, primary prevention approaches have been sought. For women at high risk of developing these malignancies (<em>BRCA</em> gene mutation, Lynch syndrome), risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (rrBSO) is advised after completion of childbearing or, depending on the specific mutation and her family history, by age 40 or 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. However, in average-risk women, routinely performing salpingo-oophorectomy for ovarian cancer prevention would result in the loss of ovarian function and associated adverse health outcomes.

Tubal specimens from average-risk women are typically from women who undergo sterilization or hysterectomy for benign indications. Many or most of these women are younger than 65 years, which is the average age of diagnosis of ovarian cancer in the general population, thus the low incidence of STICs is not surprising.

The best clinical estimate of the potential decrease in cancer risk is based on tubal ligation studies. These studies report an association of tubal ligation with an approximately 10 to 20 percent reduction in the incidence of high-grade serous carcinomas and 40 to 50 percent reduction in the incidence of endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/62-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-69</a>].

However, practice has changed because oophorectomy in premenopausal women results in early menopause, and postmenopausal hormone therapy is no longer routinely prescribed. In addition, it appears that oophorectomy is associated with adverse outcomes, including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease.

Postpartum sterilization is performed at the time of cesarean delivery or via a mini-laparotomy, and the technique used is typically partial salpingectomy. For these women, hysteroscopy is not an option. Women who undergo interval sterilization (not during a postpartum period) may have either laparoscopic or hysteroscopic procedure, and opportunistic salpingectomy cannot be performed hysteroscopically. Hysteroscopy does not require an incision or general anesthesia, but it is unclear which approach is associated with less morbidity. Women should be counseled first about the options for surgical approach, and then offered opportunistic salpingectomy only if planning laparoscopic or open sterilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-sterilization#H2759937094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic sterilization&quot;, section on 'Comparison with other sterilization approaches'</a>.)</p><p>Sterilization with complete salpingectomy cannot be reversed. The rate of sterilization regret is highest in women younger than 30 years (20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]) and with other characteristics (unmarried at time of sterilization, sterilization within three years of the youngest child, nonwhite race). Counseling for all women undergoing sterilization should emphasize that it is a permanent procedure. Women considering opportunistic salpingectomy should be assessed for risk factors for sterilization regret and informed that there is no possibility of a tubal reanastomosis.</p><p>In terms of cost, opportunistic salpingectomy adds a small amount to operative costs due to increased operative duration and possible use of additional instrumentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Further data are needed about the outcomes of this strategy to determine cost-effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. If ovarian cancer incidence is decreased, cost savings would be significant. The potential health economic and safety implications of this cancer prevention strategy are being further pursued through population-based administrative datasets that track health care use and costs for the entire population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23775007\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths in women. There is no effective screening method, and early detection and treatment are limited. (See <a href=\"#H253860495\" class=\"local\">'Overview and rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opportunistic salpingectomy is the removal of the fallopian tubes for primary prevention of epithelial carcinoma of the fallopian tube, ovary, or peritoneum in average-risk women undergoing pelvic surgery for another indication. The most common eligible procedures are hysterectomy for benign indications and sterilization via laparoscopy or laparotomy. (See <a href=\"#H627131135\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum are considered a single entity. Historically, the ovary was regarded as the most common primary site, but data suggest that many apparent ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas have a tubal precursor lesion. An association between tubal ligation and decreased risk gives additional support for the role of the fallopian tube in ovarian carcinoma pathogenesis. (See <a href=\"#H23774982\" class=\"local\">'Role of the fallopian tube'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, tube, and peritoneum includes several histologic types with varied molecular profiles and biologic behavior. The most common histologic type is high-grade serous, which typically presents at stage III or IV and has a poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H253860495\" class=\"local\">'Overview and rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks of salpingectomy appear to be minimal. Removal of the tube appears to add &lt;20 minutes to operative duration of hysterectomy or laparoscopic or open sterilization and appears to have no effect on morbidity. The risk of an impact of salpingectomy on ovarian function is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H23774995\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further long-term study is needed to determine the efficacy of opportunistic salpingectomy for cancer prevention. (See <a href=\"#H4016709391\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian cancer risk reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, we counsel women at average risk of ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma who are undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications or sterilization about the risks and benefits of opportunistic salpingectomy and employ shared decision-making with the patient. (See <a href=\"#H627131224\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most women who undergo hysterectomy with ovarian conservation, we perform salpingectomy. For women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy, removal of the tubes is feasible with a transvaginal approach or can be performed with laparoscopic assistance. We do not change the surgical route to be able to perform opportunistic salpingectomy, unless this is the strong preference of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women undergoing surgical sterilization, we discuss all options for sterilization, including complete salpingectomy, and communicate that sterilization by salpingectomy is not reversible. We share the available data regarding minimal added surgical time and risk of morbidity. We offer opportunistic salpingectomy for permanent sterilization via laparoscopy or laparotomy, including at the time of cesarean section.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Canadian Cancer Society&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Cancer Statistics.
