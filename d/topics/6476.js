It is caused by either alternating or synchronous contractions of antagonistic muscles. Tremor is the most common of all movement disorders, and essential tremor (ET) is the most common neurologic cause of postural or action tremor.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment and prognosis of ET. The clinical features and diagnosis of ET are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The surgical treatment of medically refractory ET is discussed in greater detail separately.

The decision to refer to a neurologist depends upon the clinician's confidence in the diagnosis, comfort level with use of the drugs recommended for tremor suppression, and the patient's response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515891558\"><span class=\"h2\">Who needs treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug treatment should be offered to patients with ET who have intermittent or persistent disability caused by tremor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F104216\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104216 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Individuals with mild ET and little or no tremor-related disability usually do not require treatment, although some patients are bothered by the cosmetic effect of even the least amount of shaking. Patients may not complain of being bothered or embarrassed by the tremor, they should be asked about it directly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515891936\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with ET develop exacerbations of tremor triggered by stressful social occasions or public performances. Intermittent drug treatment of ET in anticipation of these situations can be useful in such cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F104216\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104216 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For patients with mild ET who have situational exacerbations of tremor that cause concern, we suggest treatment as needed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Propranolol'</a> below). An alternative option is alcohol in small amounts (eg, one or two alcoholic drinks) (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol'</a> below). Some experts report that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a> (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Primidone'</a> below) also can be effective when used intermittently for ET exacerbated by situational stress or anxiety, but its slow onset of action limits the utility of primidone in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587344136\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with persistent functional or psychological disability (including embarrassment or anxiety) from ET generally need continuous drug therapy. In such cases, we recommend monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a> as initial therapy (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Propranolol'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Primidone'</a> below). Propranolol and primidone each may reduce tremor amplitude by approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], according to evidence from three small clinical trials that compared the two drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In the first of these, both propranolol and primidone significantly and equally reduced limb tremor compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Equivalent tremor reduction was found in the second trial after one week of propranolol treatment and two weeks of primidone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, neither drug is effective for all patients with ET. In an open-label study that examined <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a> treatment for ET in 50 patients, no therapeutic effect was found for propranolol in 7 of 23 patients (30 percent) and no therapeutic effect for primidone in 7 of 22 (32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, acute adverse reactions with primidone and chronic side effects of propranolol appear to be important limitations to the use of these drugs. However, the side effects of primidone are often self-limited (eg, &ldquo;first dose effect&rdquo;) and not necessarily a contraindication to continuing treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Propranolol'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Primidone'</a> below.)</p><p>For ET that is resistant to monotherapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a>, the two can be used together (see <a href=\"#H4584685\" class=\"local\">'Propranolol plus primidone'</a> below). Moreover, switching from one to the other is also a reasonable strategy if either agent is poorly tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4584685\"><span class=\"h2\">Propranolol plus primidone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a> may be used in combination to treat limb tremor in ET, and the combined use of these drugs is possibly more effective than either drug alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The evidence supporting this observation includes two nonrandomized studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> monotherapy at the maximum effective dose (average 260 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> reduced tremor amplitude by a mean of 35 percent; the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a>, 50 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> decreased tremor amplitude by a mean of 60 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].
