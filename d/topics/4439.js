Sleep-related hypoventilation is a clinical pattern in which the ventilatory insufficiency occurs primarily during sleep. Affected individuals are at risk for hypoxemia and bradycardia because of the hypoventilation, and require continuous monitoring during sleep to monitor for these problems. </p><p>In children, the most common cause of hypoventilation during sleep is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Non-obstructive sleep-related hypoventilation is much less common, and is usually due to one of several rare genetic or neurologic disorders of ventilatory control, especially congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), late onset central hypoventilation syndrome (LO-CHS), or rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome. These disorders will be discussed in this topic review. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88850829\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoventilation</strong> refers to a mismatch between elimination of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by the ventilatory apparatus and metabolic production of CO<sub>2</sub>. Conventionally, hypoventilation is defined as arterial blood gas partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2</sub>) above the normal levels of 35 to 45 mmHg in an awake patient. Hypoventilation is often, but not always, accompanied by hypoxemia. Clinicians may suspect hypoventilation on the basis of capillary or venous blood gas with unexplained elevations of CO<sub>2 </sub>(&gt;50 mmHg) and bicarbonate (&gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> or pulse oximetry with a baseline oxygen saturation &lt;96 percent at rest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep-related hypoventilation</strong> refers to hypoventilation that worsens or exclusively occurs during sleep. Because the hypoventilation tends to occur during daytime naps as well as during nocturnal sleep, the term &quot;sleep-related hypoventilation&quot; is preferred over &quot;nocturnal hypoventilation.&quot; During sleep, withdrawal of the wakefulness drive to breathe allows a rise in pCO<sub>2</sub> in the arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) to as high as 50 mmHg in healthy individuals. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During polysomnography in children, sleep-related hypoventilation is defined as arterial, end-tidal (P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>), or transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> (P<sub>TC</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub> </sub>levels &gt;50 mmHg for more than 25 percent of total sleep time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2 </sub>or P<sub>TC</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> values are preferred, as these techniques are continuous, noninvasive, and do not awaken the child from sleep. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. In particular, P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> tends to provide falsely low values for patients with nasal obstruction or who are receiving supplemental oxygen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central apneas</strong> are periods of absent airflow due to lack of respiratory effort. Healthy infants and children often have short central apneas lasting less than 20 seconds and without important dips in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep, and these are not considered clinically significant. Prolonged central apneas that occur during sleep suggest impaired autonomic control of ventilation; they are a hallmark of sleep-related hypoventilation disorders and other causes of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267786\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL CENTRAL HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS; <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/209880&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWO3+K9559I1uvpjaRhzri6bGLtgmGDcu737KLEPyTfly&amp;TOPIC_ID=97858\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #209880</a>) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by sleep-related hypoventilation, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and increased risk for Hirschsprung disease and tumors of neural crest origin (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma, or ganglioneuroblastoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104979 \">table 1</a>). It typically presents in the newborn period, but occasionally presents in older individuals. </p><p>CCHS presenting in a newborn infant was first described in 1970 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Evaluation showed no evidence of heart, lung, or neurologic disease although there was a history of polyhydramnios. At that time, there were about 20 case reports of an idiopathic central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS) in adults. Since then, more than 1000 cases of CCHS have been reported worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88850974\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88853983\"><span class=\"h3\">Genotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CCHS is caused by a genetic defect in <em>PHOX2B</em> (paired-like homeobox 2B gene), located on chromosome 4p12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. About 90 percent of reported cases are caused by a heterozygous 5 to 13 amino acid expansion of a 20 polyalanine tract in exon three (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F105717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105717 \">figure 1</a>). These mutations are known as polyalanine repeat mutations (PARMs). The disorder can be categorized by the presence and type of PARMs: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PARMs &ndash; In at least 80 percent of cases, the expansions involve 25 to 27 alanine repeats; these genotypes are abbreviated <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">20/26,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">20/27</span>. An additional 5 percent of cases are longer PARMs of 28 to 33 repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The shorter PARMs (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">20/24</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25)</span> are thought to be under-diagnosed because the clinical abnormalities tend to be subtle or variably expressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPARMs &ndash; About 10 percent of cases are caused by non-polyalanine repeat mutations (NPARM) mutations of <em>PHOX2B</em>; these are usually frameshift mutations in exon 3.</p><p/><p>The ventilatory defect is more severe in patients with longer PARMs and NPARMs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104974 \">table 2</a>). Patients with NPARMs typically have a severe ventilatory defect, requiring artificial ventilatory support during both wakefulness and sleep. Patients with NPARMs are also more likely to have neural crest tumors and Hirschsprung disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104974 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88851747\"><span class=\"h3\">Inheritance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>PHOX2B</em> mutations are autosomal dominant and 92 percent are de novo mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>PHOX2B</em> is located at <em>4p12</em>. <em>PHOX2B</em> PARM mutations are thought to usually occur by unequal sister chromatid exchange during paternal spermatogenesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F105717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105717 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A few occurrences of mother to child transmission have been documented. Familial occurrences primarily derive from two other mechanisms. Parental somatic mosaicism for a <em>PHOX2B</em> mutation explains cases in which an asymptomatic parent has a minority of cells expressing the mutant allele, but the child is affected. Autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance explains cases in which a parent is asymptomatic or mildly affected and a child is mildly affected. The latter cases usually result from <span class=\"nowrap\">20/24</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25</span> PARMs and may present as CCHS or late-onset CHS (LO-CHS). A few cases of presumed parental germline mosaicism have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Importantly, parental testing for <em>PHOX2B</em> should be undertaken in all cases of CCHS, and prenatal testing should be offered to affected families for subsequent pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88851367\"><span class=\"h3\">Molecular mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>PHOX2B</em> is a homeobox gene that encodes a transcription factor for central and peripheral nervous system development, and is developmentally and spatially expressed and regulated. The known functions of <em>PHOX2B</em> explain the clinical features and comorbidities of CCHS: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoventilation &ndash; In rats, the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) in the ventrolateral medulla is now considered a key site for central chemoreception transmission of a CO<sub>2 </sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/H<sup>+</sup></span> dependent signal to the central controller of breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Increased levels of CO<sub>2 </sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/H<sup>+</sup></span> cause <em>PHOX2B</em> containing RTN neurons to secrete the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in axon terminals at the pre-Boetzinger complex, the central controller of breathing. The molecule in the retrotrapezoid nucleus that senses CO<sub>2 </sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/H<sup>+</sup></span> is GPR4 (G-protein coupled receptor 4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In mice that have a <em>PHOX2B</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">20/27</span> defect, the RTN is absent and the animals have a phenotype similar to infants with CCHS: neonatal hypoventilation, apnea, and absent to diminished ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. <em>PHOX2B</em> is also expressed in other central nervous system (CNS) sites involved with control of breathing, as well as in the carotid body, the peripheral chemoreceptor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hirschsprung disease and neural crest tumors &ndash; The <em>PHOX2B</em> gene is expressed in both CNS and peripheral nervous system sites other than the RTN. The gene was originally identified in neuroblastoma cells, hence the alternative name, <em>NBPhox</em> (neuroblastoma paired-type homeobox gene). Embryologically, the <em>PHOX2B</em> gene is expressed in neural crest cells that give rise to the autonomic and enteric nervous systems. Hirschsprung disease, associated with CCHS in about 20 percent of cases, represents the failure of neural crest cells to innervate the distal intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The transcription factor <em>PHOX2B</em> influences the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene and endothelin 3 (EDN3) pathways and is required for development of the enteric nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other abnormalities &ndash; CCHS is also associated with abnormalities in cardiac and ophthalmic responses to stimuli. The cardiac findings are explained by the presence of <em>PHOX2B</em> in the precursors of autonomic ganglia innervating the heart. The ophthalmic findings are explained by <em>PHOX2B</em> expression in cranial nerve nuclei, including the trochlear (IV) and oculomotor (III) nuclei, and in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems derived from neural crest precursors. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267792\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of CCHS is abnormal control of ventilatory function, with associated abnormalities of autonomic function and risk for Hirschsprung disease and neural crest tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104979 \">table 1</a>). The presentation and clinical phenotype is closely associated with <em>PHOX2B</em> genotype.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88852257\"><span class=\"h3\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with CCHS are born full term without abnormalities during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. Affected infants typically present in the neonatal period with cyanosis occurring primarily during sleep, indicating hypoventilation and hypoxemia, which can be confirmed by a blood gas measurement of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>) and by pulse oximetry, respectively. Breathing during sleep is shallow, at or below anatomic dead space (approximately 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg)</span>. Despite hypoxemia and hypercapnia, the infant appears in no distress and does not seem to be trying to compensate for the severe blood gas abnormalities. There may or may not be associated Hirschsprung disease, neurologic abnormalities, or other organ dysfunction at the time of presentation. In some patients, the disorder will be recognized in the delivery room or in the neonatal nursery, but in others the diagnosis is delayed. </p><p>Most neonates with CCHS require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Because they have no intrinsic lung, chest wall, or airway abnormality they require minimal ventilator rates and pressures and little or no supplemental oxygen. If the infant is not artificially ventilated, blood gases show a respiratory acidosis, often compensated with a metabolic alkalosis, ie, elevations of PCO<sub>2</sub> and bicarbonate. Continuous monitoring with end-tidal (P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub> </sub>or transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> (P<sub>TC</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub> </sub>demonstrates a marked worsening of hypoventilation during sleep.</p><p>Some individuals with CCHS present after the newborn period, with episodes of cyanosis, unexplained seizures, or unusual degrees of respiratory depression after anesthesia or in response to sedatives or anticonvulsant drugs. (See <a href=\"#H267882\" class=\"local\">'Late-onset central hypoventilation syndrome (LO-CHS)'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88852037\"><span class=\"h3\">Abnormal ventilatory and arousal responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of CCHS is diminished ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104979 \">table 1</a>). This is usually present during wakefulness but is worse during sleep, particularly in non-rapid eye movement (NREM, also known as stage N or quiet) sleep, when breathing is under chemical rather than behavioral control. Both ventilatory and arousal responses to CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen are abnormal in children with CCHS. A healthy child without CCHS will maintain normal levels of pCO<sub>2</sub> as he or she transitions from wake to NREM sleep. In a child with CCHS, the polysomnogram demonstrates decreased depth of breathing, decreased rate of breathing, or both during sleep (particularly NREM sleep) without an arousal response, resulting in dramatic increases in PCO<sub>2</sub> and severity of hypoxemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104971\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104971 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. During wakefulness, the child with CCHS has an absent to diminished response to hypoxia and hypercapnia and has no subjective sensation of dyspnea or discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similarly, a study in awake CCHS patients with PARMs of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">20/27</span> showed diminished, but not absent, ventilatory, heart rate, and cerebrovascular responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia and other challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88851854\"><span class=\"h3\">Autonomic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of autonomic nervous system abnormalities have been documented in CCHS patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104979 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. CCHS patients have abnormalities in cardiovascular physiology, including blood pressure control, and in cardiac electrophysiology, including diminished heart rate variability, attenuated increase in heart rate to exercise, and sometimes prolonged QT<sub>C</sub> intervals, prolonged sinus pauses, and heart block. Some sudden unexpected deaths in CCHS patients may be due to cardiac asystole, and cardiac pacemakers have been recommended for patients with sinus pauses longer than three seconds on Holter monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In one study, ocular abnormalities were noted in 27 of 37 children with CCHS; the defects included meiosis, strabismus, and convergence insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Pupillometry has detected abnormalities in the sympathetic (meiosis) and parasympathetic (constriction after a light stimulus) control of pupil diameter, and these abnormalities were proportional to PARM length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88853105\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have reported cognitive deficits in children with CCHS, including learning disabilities, limitations in perceptual skills, and mean scores more than 1 standard deviation (SD) below the population on Wechsler intelligence scales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Children with CCHS are usually able to participate in age-appropriate classes, but often require special educational support services. A study of 31 preschool-aged children with CCHS reported modest deficits in mental development (mean scores 83.5 &plusmn; 24.75) and motor development (mean scores 73.33 &plusmn; 20.48), compared with the normative mean score of 100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The deficits were associated with more severe clinical manifestations of CCHS, including more severe cyanotic breath-holding spells and the need for daytime artificial ventilation. Children with the shortest <em>PHOX2B</em> PARM genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">(20/25)</span> had no significant cognitive deficits. Of note, scores in the mid-average range were found in one-third of these preschool-aged children, suggesting the potential for good cognitive outcomes. It remains uncertain to what extent cognitive deficits are determined by the type of <em>PHOX2B</em> mutation, versus intercurrent events such as hypoxia, comorbid disorders, complications, and lack of access to normal childhood activities and environment. Despite the uncertain mechanisms, knowledge that these children are at risk mandates vigilant developmental screening and prompt referral for remedial services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88852181\"><span class=\"h3\">Neural crest derived tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CCHS is associated with tumors of neural crest origin (primarily neuroblastomas).

The main considerations are listed in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104967\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104967 \">table 3</a>). The evaluation should include a focused history, physical examination, and plain chest radiograph. Most infants suspected of having CCHS will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) where close observation, monitoring, and routine blood and radiographic testing will suggest the diagnosis. In particular, increased work of breathing suggests a primary lung, heart, or obstructive airway problem rather than CCHS. Most neurologic disorders have associated findings such as hypotonia, weakness, abnormal reflexes, convulsions, or diminished level of consciousness. Genetic, systemic, and infectious disorders also usually have other manifestations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased work of breathing that are not characteristic of CCHS.</p><p>If the basic evaluation outlined above is consistent with CCHS, we suggest sending blood for a <em>PHOX2B</em> mutation screening test, as outlined below (see <a href=\"#H88852473\" class=\"local\">'Molecular diagnosis'</a> below). In addition, we perform the following evaluations, either before the molecular testing or while awaiting results: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polysomnography &ndash; Polysomnography is the most accurate and comprehensive method to assess sleep and breathing in a child with CCHS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104971\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104971 \">waveform 1</a>). Polysomnographic evaluations should be performed as part of the initial evaluation to document breathing during sleep and wakefulness, and should be repeated periodically thereafter. Particular attention should be directed to sleep state because ventilation and gas exchange will often be considerably worse in NREM sleep compared with REM sleep in patients with CCHS. Continuous recording of oxygen saturation and P<sub>TC</sub>CO<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, respiratory efforts, and respiratory airflow are essential. For pediatric patients, hypoventilation is scored when the P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2 </sub>or P<sub>TC</sub>CO<sub>2 </sub>is &gt;50 mmHg for more than 25 percent of total sleep time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Patients with CCHS do not have gross lesions of the brainstem, but may have nonspecific findings on MRI including reduced gray matter volume of the caudate nuclei and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. The authors speculate the findings could be due to hypoxic or ischemic events or to consequences of the <em>PHOX2B</em> mutation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac evaluation &ndash; The cardiac evaluation should include an echocardiogram to detect structural and functional cardiac abnormalities, and an electrocardiogram. The electrocardiogram should be recorded during polysomnography. If CCHS is ultimately diagnosed, a more comprehensive evaluation of cardiac rhythm may be warranted.

Ultrasound or fluoroscopy can be used to diagnose phrenic nerve injury. CCHS patients typically have normal electromyograms and nerve conduction studies, have appropriate diaphragmatic movement during inspiration when awake, and can generate normal peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures when stimulated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screen for inborn errors of metabolism &ndash; Initial evaluation includes plasma glucose, electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Infants with hypoglycemia, elevated ALT and AST, or persistent acidosis despite adequate ventilatory support warrant a more detailed evaluation for inborn errors of metabolism. Urine organic acids, plasma amino acids, and serum ammonia are usually included in the initial metabolic evaluation.

These include delayed passage of meconium (failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life), constipation, abdominal distension, tight anal sphincter, or symptoms of enterocolitis (fever, vomiting, abdominal distension, and explosive diarrhea). Infants with any of these symptoms warrant an urgent full evaluation, usually consisting of a contrast enema and rectal suction biopsy. An evaluation for Hirschsprung disease is also warranted for infants with confirmed CCHS with <em>PHOX2B </em>genotypes NPARM or PARM <span class=\"nowrap\">20/26</span> or longer, regardless of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

A two-stage evaluation has been suggested. A <em>PHOX2B</em> screening test consists of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified polyalanine repeat section of exon 3. This will identify 95 percent of CCHS cases, all PARMs, and some NPARMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Additionally, this test can detect somatic mosaicism (parental). For patients with negative results of the screening test but a high clinical suspicion for CCHS, sequencing of the entire coding regions of the <em>PHOX2B</em> gene should be performed; this test will detect 99 percent of mutations in probands. A list of laboratories that provide screening for CCHS is available at the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/y3+Lj0shalBW+L1ZyL4tryNPgji1PaJ6Kbd/o1hE9A6&amp;TOPIC_ID=97858\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Genetic Testing Registry</a> website. &#160;</p><p>LO-CHS cases present in infancy, childhood, or adult life.

Most will require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation during the initial diagnostic process. Administration of supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation is not sufficient; although this strategy improves the oxygenation and relieves the cyanosis, it does not relieve the hypercarbia and associated risks for pulmonary hypertension. </p><p>In most cases, tracheostomy with positive pressure ventilation is considered the safest way to manage the infants in the hospital and at home. Ventilation and oxygenation must be monitored and assured to be adequate during wakefulness as well as sleep. In late infancy and early childhood, ventilation often becomes somewhat more stable and other options for lifetime support become feasible. In patients with a more severe ventilatory defect (typically found in patients with longer PARM and most NPARM mutations), assisted ventilation is needed during both wakefulness and sleep. In such patients, ventilation with tracheostomy during sleep and diaphragmatic pacing during wakefulness can improve quality of life and mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pacing the diaphragm: Patient selection, evaluation, implantation, and complications&quot;</a>). In milder cases, gas exchange during wakefulness can be adequate so that positive pressure assisted ventilation is required only during sleep. If ventilation is only required during sleep, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with a mask is an option and is preferred by many families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267870\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring and home care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous pulse oximetry should be used for in-hospital and at-home monitoring of CCHS patients.

Adequacy of ventilation should be assessed intermittently with a P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> monitor, particularly if supplemental oxygen is being used; supplemental oxygen may obscure clinically significant hypoventilation. Downloads of data from the oximeter can provide assurance of adequate ventilatory support over longer periods. </p><p>Individuals with CCHS are at risk for episodes of hypoxemia that 72 hours may be life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>].

The first few years of life may be quite normal. The excessive weight gain is usually the first feature, and is often very rapid (eg, 20 to 40 pound gain over six months) and associated with hyperphagia.

Brief central pauses in respiratory effort (less than 20 seconds) that cause neither oxygen desaturation nor arousal from sleep are benign and are not clinically significant. In the pediatric age group, clinically significant CSA most often occurs in premature infants, or in the setting of systemic, genetic, or neurologic disorders affecting the brainstem or other central nervous system (CNS) sites involved in the control of breathing. In adults, CSA is often a consequence of heart failure or CNS lesions, particularly stroke and destructive brainstem lesions, but can also be idiopathic. </p><p>Apnea in premature infants can persist until 44 weeks postmenstrual age. They are also at risk for apnea after surgery, particularly if they receive general anesthesia, and this risk continues until they are about 60 weeks postmenstrual age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Children with Down syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are at risk for both CSA and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. As an example, in a study of 969 patients referred to a pediatric sleep laboratory, 52 (5.4 percent) had more than five central apneic events per hour of sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Most of the patients with CSA had neurologic disorders, including myelomeningocele with Chiari II malformation, brainstem compression, encephalitis, tumors, and genetic syndromes. Brainstem <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cranial nerve compression, stretching, or vascular insufficiency may cause either central or obstructive patterns. As an example, in a study of 83 children with myelomeningocele and Chiari II malformation who underwent polysomnography, 17 patients had moderately or severely abnormal sleep-disordered breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The apneas were predominantly central in 12 patients, and predominantly obstructive in five patients. Similarly, in a study of 31 pediatric brain tumor survivors referred to a sleep laboratory (mostly for excessive daytime somnolence), OSA was found in 14 patients with sellar, parasellar, or hypothalamic tumors, while central apneas were found in four children with tumors of the brainstem, posterior fossa, or spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In patients with CNS disorders that predispose to brainstem compression, such as Chiari I or II malformations, achondroplasia, craniosynostosis syndromes or osteopetrosis, the presence of CSA raises the possibility of progressive brainstem impingement that might require surgical decompression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chiari-malformations#H10173945\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chiari malformations&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p>Sleep-disordered breathing, including OSA and CSA, should be suspected in children with neurologic disease and witnessed apnea or cyanosis. Polysomnography is required to delineate the type and severity of sleep-disordered breathing. Conversely, a finding of unexplained CSA warrants a careful neurologic evaluation, with CNS imaging in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome-and-other-causes-of-sleep-related-hypoventilation-in-children/abstract/48,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,52</a>].

During sleep, withdrawal of the wakefulness drive to breathe allows a rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub>. As a result, in patients with disorders of ventilatory control the hypoventilation tends to be most severe during sleep. (See <a href=\"#H88850829\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoventilation can be caused by disorders of the brain, spinal cord, nerves, muscles, lungs, or airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104967\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104967 \">table 3</a>). In patients without apparent abnormalities in these organ systems, and particularly in those with sleep-related hypoventilation or central sleep apneas (CSAs), a disorder of ventilatory control should be considered. Important causes of sleep-related hypoventilation in neonates are prematurity, an underlying brain disorder, or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) </strong>usually presents at birth or in the neonatal period with symptoms of hypoventilation (eg, cyanosis and shallow breathing), without apparent respiratory distress. Patients with CCHS do not adequately increase ventilation in response to hypercapnia or hypoxia, especially during sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104971\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104971 \">waveform 1</a>). CCHS is associated with a wide variety of abnormalities including Hirschsprung disease, neural crest derived tumors (primarily neuroblastoma), bradycardia, ophthalmologic abnormalities, and other autonomic system abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104979 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H267792\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CCHS is caused by mutation in the paired-like homeobox 2B gene <em>(PHOX2B)</em> gene, a transcription factor on chromosome <em>4p12</em> that controls neural development. More than 90 percent of reported cases are caused by a heterozygous 5 to 13 amino acid expansion of a 20 polyalanine tract in exon three of <em>PHOX2B</em>; such mutations are known as polyalanine repeat mutations (PARMs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F105717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105717 \">figure 1</a>). Most other CCHS cases are caused by frameshift mutations in <em>PHOX2B</em>, known as non-polyalanine repeat mutations (NPARMs). Patients with NPARMs tend to have more severe and complicated disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104974 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H88853983\" class=\"local\">'Genotypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diagnosis of CCHS requires exclusion of other causes of sleep-related hypoventilation and demonstration of a mutation in the <em>PHOX2B</em> gene. Treatment includes artificial ventilation during sleep and often during wakefulness. Monitoring of oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>(P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> and extensive home care support are required, as well as regular re-evaluation with polysomnography, cardiac testing, cognitive testing, and surveillance for neural crest tumors. (See <a href=\"#H88852387\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H267858\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare causes of sleep-related hypoventilation that present after the neonatal period include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Late-onset central hypoventilation syndrome (LO-CHS)</strong> &ndash; Like CCHS, this disorder is caused by <em>PHOX2B</em> mutations. The cases that present after the neonatal period usually have heterozygous <span class=\"nowrap\">20/24</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25</span> PARMs. Patients with LO-CHS usually have milder phenotypes than CCHS patients presenting in the neonatal period. (See <a href=\"#H267882\" class=\"local\">'Late-onset central hypoventilation syndrome (LO-CHS)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysfunction (ROHHAD)</strong> &ndash; This is a disorder of unknown etiology. It typically presents in early childhood with rapid onset of obesity, followed by hypothalamic or pituitary endocrine disorders, nocturnal hypoventilation, and autonomic nervous system findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88393\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88393 \">table 5</a>). Patients are also at risk for developing tumors of neural crest origin (ganglioneuromas and ganglioneuroblastomas). (See <a href=\"#H267888\" class=\"local\">'Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction (ROHHAD)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSA and sleep-related hypoventilation can be caused by neurologic disease affecting control of breathing in the central nervous system (CNS), including brain tumors or brain malformations that impinge on the brainstem, such as Chiari malformations, and some skull malformations (craniosynostosis syndromes, achondroplasia, or osteopetrosis). Central control of breathing also may be affected by CNS depressant medications, epilepsy, or infections.
