The diagnosis of CLL and treatment of the underlying disorder are presented separately. The risk of infections and prevention of infections in patients with CLL are also discussed in detail separately.

While most clinicians agree that patients with CLL should receive appropriate vaccinations, the use of other prophylactic measures is more controversial.

The risks of transfusion in patients with CLL are similar to those in other patients. Transfusion reactions are not common in patients with CLL. Leukocyte-depleted and, in rare instances, washed red cell products should be considered for patients who have repeated episodes of transfusion reactions. Irradiated blood products have been used in severely immunosuppressed patients in an attempt to reduce the risk of transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease. We recommend the use of irradiated blood products in patients with CLL.

Issues surrounding the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) versus transfusion are discussed in detail separately.

The peripheral smear should be analyzed for an estimation of platelet numbers, morphology, presence or absence of platelet clumping, as well as evaluation of associated white and red blood cell changes. In patients with infections or fever, coagulation parameters should be checked, including the PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy can help to determine the underlying cause in difficult cases.

Up to one-third of cases will have concurrent autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the combination of which is referred to as Evan's syndrome.

Ideally, two to three weeks prior to splenectomy, patients should be vaccinated against pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae B, and meningococcus. In addition, some clinicians advocate lifelong penicillin (or equivalent) prophylaxis for pneumococcus due to uncertainty of immune response to vaccination.

The most common are the same as in the non-CLL population: lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancers. It is unknown how much of this increased risk is due to the underlying disease and accompanying chronic immunosuppression and how much is due to the treatments given. There have been no studies of cancer screening in patients with CLL. Patients with CLL should undergo age and sex appropriate screening measures for solid tumors.

The tumor types that have demonstrated increased rates have varied among studies.</p><p>The largest retrospective study was an analysis of 16,367 patients with CLL enrolled in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and followed for an average of 5.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Eleven percent developed a second solid tumor, a rate that was significantly higher than that for the general population (odds ratio of 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.26).

This inferior survival remained when CLL-related deaths were excluded.</p><p>It is unknown why patients with CLL who have a solid tumor appear to have worse survival. Solid tumors that develop in patients with CLL may be biologically different from those that develop in the general population. This could be related to the patient's underlying genetics or the impact of prior therapy for CLL. Alternatively, patients with CLL may be less able to tolerate preferred treatment strategies due to underlying cytopenias or immunosuppression.
