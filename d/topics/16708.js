Muscular contractions produce positive myoclonus, whereas muscular inhibitions produce negative myoclonus (ie, asterixis).

Symptomatic myoclonus can occur in association with conditions that span the entire spectrum of neurologic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78331\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78331 \">table 1</a>). Often there is clinical or pathologic evidence of diffuse nervous system involvement.</p><p>Symptomatic myoclonus is the most common type of myoclonus, accounting for 72 percent of cases in one large epidemiologic study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-secondary-myoclonus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Posthypoxic state, neurodegenerative disease, and epilepsy syndromes are the most common causes. Toxic-metabolic and drug-induced etiologies are particularly common in the hospital setting.</p><p>Most patients with symptomatic myoclonus have additional clinical manifestations, such as cognitive abnormalities, ataxia, or other movement disorders. These features can be more prominent than the myoclonus. While seizures may occur in many of these entities, encephalopathy (ie, a confusional state secondary to a diffuse brain disorder, sometimes called delirium) predominates, and the causative syndrome is not considered a primary epileptic disorder.</p><p>Many conditions with symptomatic myoclonus are further characterized by chronic or subacute clinical progression. The cortex is the most common origin of the myoclonic jerks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGRESSIVE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY AND PROGRESSIVE MYOCLONIC ATAXIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic myoclonus is a major feature of the rare, genetically heterogeneous syndromes known as progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) and progressive myoclonic ataxia (PMA). The latter is also known as dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica or the Ramsay-Hunt cerebellar syndrome (to be distinguished from the Ramsay-Hunt zoster syndrome of the facial nerve).</p><p>PME and PMA share overlapping phenotypes and causes. The myoclonus physiology demonstrated in these disorders is cortical action <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cortical reflex myoclonus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of myoclonus&quot;, section on 'Anatomic and physiologic classification'</a>.)</p><p>The main features of PME are seizures, myoclonus, ataxia, and dementia, usually leading to severe mental impairment and death. PME can be differentiated from the more benign epileptic syndromes and from PMA by its progressive nature and the greater severity of the seizures and cognitive decline. The myoclonus associated with PME is typically multifocal and induced by action or by somatosensory stimulation, including touch, sound, or light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-secondary-myoclonus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The most common causes of PME are Lafora disease, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, and Gaucher disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-secondary-myoclonus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Rare causes of PME include the action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome, juvenile Huntington disease, familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies, noninfantile neuronopathic Gaucher disease, atypical inclusion body disease, neuroaxonal dystrophy, celiac disease, juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (formerly known as Hallervorden-Spatz disease), <em>C9orf72</em> repeat expansion, and early-onset Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-secondary-myoclonus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>In the syndrome of PMA, cerebellar ataxia and myoclonus are the more prominent or sole components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-secondary-myoclonus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Clinical progression is slower than in PME. The most frequent causes of PMA are Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD), sialidosis, celiac disease, mitochondrial disorders, certain spinocerebellar degenerations, and some late-onset metabolic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-secondary-myoclonus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is an autosomal recessive disorder. Symptoms usually begin between ages 6 and 15 years with stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. Affected patients develop dysarthria, ataxia, intention tremor, and mild intellectual decline. While progressive, the clinical course is variable. Some patients are bedridden within five years after onset of symptoms, while others are able to live independently.

Myoclonus is a common, but not universal feature of CJD. It tends to be generalized and can be provoked by loud noise (startle).

The examination of a patient with myoclonus should delineate the distribution, temporal profile, and activation characteristics of the myoclonus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51170\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51170 \">table 3</a>). Ancillary testing should be performed if the etiology remains unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of myoclonus&quot;, section on 'Syndrome identification'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of myoclonus&quot;, section on 'Ancillary studies'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical neurophysiology testing is useful to determine the physiologic classification of myoclonus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56405\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56405 \">table 4</a>). In addition, it is helpful when clinical observation alone is unable to distinguish myoclonus from other involuntary movements such as chorea, dystonia, and tremor. Simultaneous electroencephalography-electromyography polygraphy is the most important clinical neurophysiology study, since it can show the approximate relationship of electroencephalography activity with myoclonus, and determine which muscles are most frequently involved with the myoclonic jerks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of myoclonus&quot;, section on 'Clinical neurophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>For hospitalized patients with new or recent onset of myoclonus, toxic-metabolic and drug-induced etiologies are most common. The initial evaluation should focus on these potential causes and look for subacute or acute systemic and neurologic conditions that are associated with myoclonus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F113639\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113639 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Myoclonus that develops in a patient after transplantation may have multiple possible etiologies. A major consideration is the net state of immunosuppression, which is a complex function determined by the interaction of several factors. These include the use of immunosuppressive therapy itself; underlying diseases or comorbid conditions; devitalized tissues or fluid collections in the transplanted organ; invasive devices such as vascular access or urinary catheters, surgical drains, and ventricular assist devices; other host factors affecting immune function including neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and metabolic problems (eg, protein-calorie malnutrition, diabetes); and concomitant infection with immunomodulating viruses including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and -7, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Thus, new-onset myoclonus following transplantation should trigger a thorough investigation for possible infection (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a>.).</p><p>Other potential causes of myoclonus in the setting of transplantation are directly related to organ dysfunction, such as hepatic encephalopathy or uremia. In addition, organ dysfunction can change drug metabolism, such that a previously tolerated medication dose can lead to elevated drug levels associated with myoclonus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
