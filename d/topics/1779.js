The condition develops as a consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and predisposes to the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.</p><p>The pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus and the mechanisms of transformation into adenocarcinoma will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of this disorder (including surveillance for adenocarcinoma) are discussed, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barrett's esophagus develops through the process of metaplasia, in which one kind of fully differentiated (adult) tissue replaces another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Metaplasia commonly is a consequence of chronic inflammation, and Barrett&rsquo;s metaplasia results from chronic reflux esophagitis caused by the gastroesophageal reflux of acid, bile, and other noxious substances. In most patients, reflux-induced mucosal damage is repaired by the regeneration of more squamous cells. In some patients, for reasons that are not clear, the reflux-damaged esophagus is repaired through a columnar metaplasia in which columnar cells replace squamous cells. For more than a decade, the prevailing hypothesis has been that Barrett&rsquo;s metaplasia is the result of transcommitment, in which progenitor cells in the esophagus that normally would differentiate into squamous cells instead differentiate into columnar cells. Research in animal models has challenged this transcommitment hypothesis by providing evidence that Barrett&rsquo;s metaplasia might result from the proximal migration of stem cells from the gastric cardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], or from the expansion of a nest of residual embryonic-type cells located at the gastroesophageal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Finally, in a rat model of reflux esophagitis, Barrett&rsquo;s metaplasia appears to occur when circulating stem cells from the bone marrow are transported through the blood to the damaged esophagus, where they differentiate into columnar cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is not clear which, if any, of these hypotheses on the pathogenesis of Barrett&rsquo;s metaplasia is correct. </p><p>The metaplastic columnar cells of Barrett's esophagus are in some ways a favorable adaptation to chronic reflux since they appear to be more resistant to reflux-induced injury than the native squamous cells. Unfortunately, esophageal columnar metaplasia predisposes to the development of adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The pattern of acid secretion may be an important determinant in the neoplastic progression of Barrett's metaplasia. An ex vivo study demonstrated that pulsed acid exposure increased cell proliferation, but continuous acid exposure decreased cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Another report found that the length of Barrett's esophagus correlated with the percent of supine reflux and percent of total time that esophageal pH was &lt;4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other studies have demonstrated that patients with longstanding and severe reflux symptoms are at increased risk for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Several physiologic abnormalities contribute to the severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients with long segment Barrett's esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66514\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66514 \">table 1</a>). As a result, patients who have long segment Barrett's esophagus are predisposed to reflux highly caustic gastric contents (often without warning symptoms) into an esophagus whose ability to protect itself is compromised by defective clearance mechanisms and diminished secretion of growth factors.</p><p>Given the propensity for severe GERD in patients with long segment Barrett's esophagus, it was initially assumed that the metaplasia progressed in extent over the years as columnar epithelium replaced more and more reflux-damaged squamous epithelium. However, for reasons that are unclear, such progression is observed only rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In most cases, Barrett's esophagus appears to develop to its full extent over a short period of time (ie, &lt;1 year), with little or no subsequent progression. Why this occurs is not well understood.</p><p>Patients with short-segment Barrett's esophagus often have few or no symptoms and signs of GERD. The development of the intestinal metaplasia typical of Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus in patients with short-segment disease may be due to exposure to noxious agents that accumulate at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). After meals, there is a pocket of acid at the GEJ that escapes the buffering effects of ingested food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This postprandial acid pocket has a mean length of 2 cm, beginning in the most proximal stomach and extending more than 1 cm above the squamocolumnar junction (Z-line) into the distal esophagus. In healthy volunteers, the very distal esophagus (5 mm above the Z-line) is exposed to acid for more than 10 percent of the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Potential consequences of such persistent acid exposure include not only acid-peptic injury, but also exposure to high concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) generated from dietary nitrates (NO3) in green, leafy vegetables. Most ingested nitrate is absorbed by the small intestine and excreted unchanged in the urine, but approximately 25 percent is concentrated by the salivary glands and secreted into the mouth where bacteria on the tongue reduce the recycled nitrate to nitrite (NO2). When swallowed nitrite encounters acidic gastric juice, the nitrite is converted rapidly to nitric oxide (NO). After nitrate ingestion, high levels of NO have been demonstrated at the GEJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. NO can be genotoxic and, potentially, carcinogenic. Thus, the GEJ is exposed repeatedly to acid, pepsin, NO, and other noxious agents in gastric juice that can lead to chronic inflammation and metaplasia.</p><p>In addition to GERD, smoking has also been associated with the risk of Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus. In a pooled analysis of five population-based case-control studies from the International BEACON (Barrett&rsquo;s Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium), the risk of Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus was 1.7 times greater in smokers than in nonsmokers without GERD, and was 1.6 times greater than in nonsmokers with GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, smoking appeared to have a synergistic effect with GERD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditionally, three types of columnar epithelia have been described in Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac epithelium (also called cardia-type or junctional epithelium), which has a foveolar (pitted) surface and glands that are lined almost exclusively by mucus-secreting cells; these cells resemble gastric foveolar cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrophic gastric fundic-type epithelium (also called oxyntocardiac epithelium), which has a foveolar surface lined by mucus-secreting cells, and a deeper glandular layer that contains chief and parietal cells; these cells resemble those in the gastric fundus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specialized intestinal metaplasia (also called specialized columnar epithelium), which has intestinal-type crypts lined by mucus-secreting columnar cells and goblet cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80518\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80518 \">picture 1A</a>).</p><p/><p>Specialized intestinal metaplasia has intestinal features such as goblet cells and villi that readily distinguish it from normal gastric and esophageal mucosae. It is the most common histologic type found in Barrett's esophagus, and the only one that has a clear malignant potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most authorities insist on the demonstration of specialized intestinal metaplasia to confirm an endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, although evidence has been accumulating that cardiac epithelium also might predispose to cancer development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Specialized intestinal metaplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two main mucosal components of Barrett's esophagus are the surface epithelium and the underlying glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Reduplication of the muscularis mucosae with interposed lamina propria may be present. The mucosa can be flat or villiform.</p><p>Specialized intestinal metaplasia comprises a number of columnar cell types including goblet cells, gastric-type cells, small intestinal-like cells, and colonic-like columnar cells. Endocrine and Paneth cells have also been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77542 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Specialized intestinal metaplasia can be indistinguishable histologically from intestinal metaplasia type II or III of the stomach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of goblet cells is the most useful feature for distinguishing specialized intestinal metaplasia from cardiac mucosa. The goblet cells of specialized intestinal metaplasia contain acidic mucins (sialomucins and sulfomucins) that can be demonstrated by staining with Alcian blue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80518%7EGAST%2F68357\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80518 graphicRef68357 \">picture 1A-B</a>). They may also contain colonic-like mucins that can be demonstrated with high-iron diamine staining (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58143 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>It has been proposed that the specialized intestinal metaplasia of Barrett's esophagus has a characteristic pattern of cytokeratin (CK) expression with immunoreactivity for CK20 seen in the surface epithelial cells and superficial glands, but not in the deep glands, whereas immunoreactivity for CK 7 is observed in both the superficial and deep glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The specificity and sensitivity of this so-called &quot;Barrett's CK <span class=\"nowrap\">7/20</span> pattern&quot; is disputed, and authorities have advised against basing clinical decisions on the results of cytokeratin immunostaining in Barrett's esophagus.</p><p>Alterations in the bacteria of the distal esophagus associated with inflammation and intestinal metaplasia have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], yet the clinical importance of this finding remains to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancers in Barrett's esophagus evolve through a sequence of DNA alterations that give the cells certain growth advantages, and cause morphological changes in the tissue that the pathologist can recognize as dysplasia. Dysplasia is a constellation of histological abnormalities suggesting that one or more clones of cells have acquired genetic damage rendering them neoplastic and predisposed to malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Pathologists diagnose dysplasia when they recognize a constellation of characteristic cytological and architectural abnormalities in tissue biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Cytologic abnormalities include nuclear enlargement, pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, and stratification. Atypical mitoses and loss of cytoplasmic maturation are also seen. Architectural changes include crowding of tubules and villiform surfaces. The presence of these abnormalities suggests that the tissue has sustained genetic damage resulting in clonal proliferations of cells with abnormal differentiation and a predisposition to malignancy. Dysplasia is graded as low or high grade based upon the severity of architectural and cytologic features.</p><p>Unfortunately, dysplasia is an imperfect marker for malignancy because of interobserver disagreement in grading its severity, biopsy sampling error, and incomplete data on natural history. Among experienced pathologists, interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus is less than 50 percent, while for high-grade dysplasia interobserver agreement is approximately 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett's</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barrett's esophagus is thought to be the precursor of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Adenocarcinomas that straddle the GEJ are approximately twice as common as adenocarcinomas that clearly arise from the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50584\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50584 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. With straddling tumors, it can be difficult to determine whether the neoplasm arose from the columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus or in the proximal stomach (the gastric cardia). These tumors cannot be distinguished from one another morphologically, and they share a number of epidemiologic features including an association with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a strong predilection for white males, and a rapidly rising incidence in Western countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Biochemical studies are also consistent with the hypothesis that Barrett's esophagus is the precursor for most GEJ tumors. In one series, for example, similar profiles of intestinal-type proteins were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in Barrett's esophagus and in 26 cases of adenocarcinoma with or without obvious Barrett's in tumors from both esophagus and cardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These profiles were not seen in normal stomach or esophageal mucosa, in peptic esophagitis, or in squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of malignant transformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carcinogenesis in metaplastic cells begins with genetic alterations that either activate proto-oncogenes, disable tumor suppressor genes, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27</a>]. Neoplastic progression observed in patients with Barrett's esophagus commonly includes alterations in the tumor suppressor genes p53 (also known as TP53) and p16 (also known as CDKN2A), and in the cyclin D1 protooncogene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/5,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,29</a>]. In addition to these changes, aneuploid or tetraploid populations can be found by flow cytometry in more than 90 percent of adenocarcinomas, and these same flow cytometric abnormalities may predict progression in Barrett's epithelium prior to malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>These DNA abnormalities endow the cells with certain growth advantages, permitting them to hyperproliferate. During hyperproliferation, the cells acquire more genetic changes that eventuate in autonomous cell growth (neoplasia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80916\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80916 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. When enough DNA abnormalities accumulate, a clone of malignant cells emerges that has the ability to invade adjacent tissues and to proliferate in unnatural locations.</p><p>The evolution of genetic changes leading from Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma is incompletely understood. It appears that diploid progenitor cells first develop abnormalities in p53 and p16, which permit clonal expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These abnormal cells are capable of spreading within large regions of the esophageal mucosa. Subsequently, a number of additional genetic alterations develop involving loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 5q, 13q, and 18q in no discernible order relative to one another.</p><p>Before the cells acquire enough DNA damage to become frankly malignant, the earlier genetic alterations often cause morphologic changes that can be recognized on histologic examination as dysplasia. As discussed above, the dysplastic changes are graded as low-grade or high-grade depending upon the degree of alterations in nuclear morphology and glandular architecture (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dysplasia'</a> above).</p><p>Whether acid suppression influences the genetic evolution of Barrett's epithelium is uncertain. However, effective acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor has been associated with increased epithelial cell differentiation and decreased proliferation, suggesting that it has a favorable effect on dysplasia progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The COX-2 inhibitors may also hinder cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting a possible role in chemoprevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>The gastroesophageal reflux of bile acids also appears to contribute to carcinogenesis in Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus. One study revealed that bile acids cause both DNA damage and activation of the NF-&kappa;B pathway in Barrett&rsquo;s metaplastic cells. Ordinarily, severe DNA damage that might predispose to malignancy triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death), which destroys those cells that have potentially carcinogenic mutations. However, NF-&kappa;B activation prevents apoptosis in Barrett&rsquo;s metaplasia. Thus, bile acid reflux can simultaneously damage DNA and activate a process that enables the survival of cells with cancer-causing mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Helicobacter pylori infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric infection with <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> causes chronic inflammation that can result in intestinal metaplasia and cancer in the stomach. However, the organism does not infect the esophagus and there is no positive association between <em>H. pylori</em> infection and GERD. Indeed, a number of studies suggest that <em>H. pylori</em> infection may protect the esophagus from GERD and its complications like Barrett's esophagus, perhaps by causing a chronic gastritis that interferes with acid production. <em>H. pylori</em> strains that express cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) appear to be especially damaging to the stomach, and especially protective for the esophagus. Despite the theoretical protective benefit, studies evaluating the association of Barrett's esophagus and <em>H. pylori</em> infection have shown mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].
