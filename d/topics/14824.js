In this trial, 673 patients with active RA were randomly assigned to receive either tocilizumab (8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every four weeks either at study onset or after treatment with placebo for eight weeks) or MTX (titrated from 7.5 up to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> within eight weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/randomized-clinical-trials-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-of-biologic-agents-that-inhibit-il-1-il-6-and-rankl/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The patients who received tocilizumab, in comparison with MTX, were significantly more likely at week 24 to achieve an ACR20 (70 versus 53 percent) or clinical remission (DAS28 less than 2.6, 34 versus 12 percent).</p><p>The frequency of serious adverse events and serious infections were similar between the tocilizumab- and MTX-treated groups (3.8 versus 2.8 percent and 1.4 versus 0.7 percent, respectively). More patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> experienced a reversible neutropenia (3.1 versus 0.4 percent) and an increased incidence of total cholesterol greater than 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (13.2 versus 0.4 percent). Increased aminotransferases occurred in both groups, but the majority improved following dose modification. Four patients on MTX and one on tocilizumab discontinued medications due to these changes.

It exhibits modest clinical efficacy and a dose-dependent increased risk of serious infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with placebo.
