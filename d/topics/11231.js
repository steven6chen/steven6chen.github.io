The valves work like swinging doors that open only 1 way &ndash; letting blood out, but not back in. Normally, little or no blood is able to leak backward. But if the valves are not working properly, more blood can go back in the direction it came from. This can cause problems.</p><p>The mitral valve normally keeps blood flowing from the left atrium to the left ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58389 \">figure 1</a>). When it leaks, it lets blood flow back into the left atrium. A small (or &quot;trace&quot;) amount of mitral regurgitation occurs in most healthy people, but this does not cause problems. Some people have larger amounts of mitral regurgitation, and this can get worse with time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1741881962\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of mitral regurgitation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with mitral regurgitation have no symptoms. But some people with severe mitral regurgitation have 1 or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the ankles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61706 \">figure 2</a>), legs, or belly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1741881969\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for mitral regurgitation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks you could have more than slight mitral regurgitation, he or she might order 1 or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</strong> &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart. It can show whether you have signs of abnormal heart muscle or had a heart attack in the past. These are some of the things that can cause mitral regurgitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A chest X-ray</strong> &ndash; A chest X-ray shows if there is fluid in the lungs. It also shows the general shape and size of the heart. Many people with severe mitral regurgitation have an enlarged heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An echocardiogram (or &quot;echo&quot; for short)</strong> &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart as it beats. It shows the size of the heart chambers, how well the heart is pumping, and how well the heart valves are working.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1741881976\"><span class=\"h1\">How is mitral regurgitation treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have more than a trace amount of mitral regurgitation, your doctor might just keep an eye on you to see if it gets worse. If you have no symptoms, you might not need any treatment.</p><p>For those who do need treatment, options might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine or surgery to correct heart rhythm problems that often affect people with mitral valve disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that lower blood pressure and make it easier for the heart to do its job</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1741881983\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with mitral regurgitation who have no symptoms or mild symptoms are often able to have normal pregnancies. But women who have symptoms with severe mitral regurgitation can have serious problems during pregnancy.</p><p>If you have mitral regurgitation and would like to get pregnant, talk with your doctor about it before you start trying. Some women need to have surgery to replace or repair their mitral valve before they try to have a baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1741881990\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-can-go-wrong-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What can go wrong after a heart attack?
