Although CAA is usually asymptomatic, it is an important cause of primary lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It can occur as a sporadic disorder, sometimes in association with Alzheimer disease (AD), or as a certain familial syndrome. In addition to intracerebral hemorrhage, CAA may present with transient neurological symptoms, an inflammatory leukoencephalopathy, as a contributor to cognitive impairment, or with incidental microhemorrhages or hemosiderosis on MRI. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), like Alzheimer disease (AD), is strongly age dependent. Based upon a series of 784 autopsy cases, we estimated the prevalence of moderate to severe CAA as 2.3 percent for patients between the ages of 65 and 74, 8.0 percent between the ages of 75 and 84, and 12.1 percent over the age of 85 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although sporadic, CAA-related symptoms are uncommon at ages younger than 60 to 65 they can more rarely affect individuals in their 50s as well.</p><p>There is no strong predilection for gender. Although the association of CAA with hypertension is debated, it is clear that many patients with CAA-related hemorrhage are normotensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular amyloid deposits in sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are biochemically similar to the material comprising senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The primary constituent of each is amyloid beta-peptide, a 39 to 43 amino acid fragment of the amyloid precursor protein. There is essentially no clinical overlap between CAA and the non-CNS systemic amyloidoses, such as primary (amyloid AL) and secondary (amyloid AA) amyloidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutant amyloid precursor protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the gene that encodes the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are responsible for some cases of &quot;presenile&quot; CAA. While most of these mutations are also associated with at least some of the neuropathologic features of AD, at least one APP mutation (Leu34Val) has been reported to cause autosomal dominant CAA without parenchymal amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There is in-vitro evidence that the Dutch, Iowa, Italian, and Arctic mutations in APP may increase the toxicity of the peptide towards components of the vessel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Another potentially pathogenic effect of these mutations is to decrease the susceptibility of the amyloid beta peptide to proteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] or clearance from the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These findings highlight various mechanisms by which mutant APP might contribute to CAA in heritable forms of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Apolipoprotein E</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factors that initiate or promote amyloid beta-peptide deposition in CAA that occurs later in life are not well understood. However, a number of observations have begun to enhance our understanding of this disorder. Perhaps best studied has been the relationship between CAA and alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE). Patients carrying the APOE epsilon 2 (&epsilon;2) or epsilon 4 (&epsilon;4) alleles appear to be at greater risk for CAA-related hemorrhage than those with only the common APOE epsilon 3 (&epsilon;3) allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>]. One systematic review found that there is good evidence for a dose-dependent association between APOE &epsilon;4 and sporadic CAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Data from a prospective cohort indicate that one or both of these alleles are present in approximately two-thirds of patients with CAA compared with only about one-quarter of elderly controls without hemorrhage. These alleles are associated with an increased likelihood of having a CAA-related hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], earlier age of disease onset (mean age of first hemorrhage 75 versus 82 years in patients who are not carriers of APOE &epsilon;2 or &epsilon;4), and a greater risk of hemorrhage recurrence (two year cumulative recurrence rate of 28 percent in carriers of &epsilon;2 or &epsilon;4 versus 10 percent for the APOE <span class=\"nowrap\">&epsilon;3/&epsilon;3</span> genotype) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients with CAA who have both APOE &epsilon;2 and &epsilon;4 alleles appear to have a particularly early onset of disease and a high risk of early recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. Carriers of the APOE &epsilon;2 allele also have larger ICH volumes, increased mortality, and worse functional outcomes compared to noncarriers, while these associations are not seen for carriers of the APOE &epsilon;4 allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Data from a population-based, case-control study suggest that the risk of lobar ICH associated with APOE alleles may be modified by variation elsewhere in the APOE gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Notably, overall APOE haplotype (combination of multiple alleles on one chromosome) was also independently associated with lobar ICH, suggesting the presence of regulatory variants that could influence the effect of APOE &epsilon;2 or &epsilon;4 on the risk of lobar ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Other factors that interact with the &epsilon;2 genotype may promote cerebral hemorrhage. In one report, antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication, hypertension, or minor head trauma were significantly more common antecedents of CAA-related hemorrhage among &epsilon;2 carriers than among non-&epsilon;2 carriers (81 versus 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The authors hypothesized that this may result from an APOE isoform-specific effect upon amyloid laden blood vessels that causes the vessels to be more vulnerable to rupture in the presence of these other factors. </p><p>Vascular rupture and bleeding in CAA appears to be a multistep process involving the deposition of amyloid beta-peptide in the vascular wall and subsequent vascular changes such as cracking of the vascular wall. It has been suggested that the &epsilon;2 and &epsilon;4 alleles act via separate mechanisms: &epsilon;4 increased amyloid beta-peptide deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; and &epsilon;2 causes amyloid-laden vessels to undergo changes such as cracking and necrosis that predispose to rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>].</p><p>There is additional evidence that APOE &epsilon;4 alleles affect amyloid beta-peptide deposition. Among patients with severe head injury, for example, the APOE &epsilon;4 allele is associated with an increased risk of deposition of amyloid beta-peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This allele also promotes deposition of amyloid beta-peptide in AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other molecular factors likely contribute to the pathogenesis of CAA. As an example, transgenic mice overexpressing the inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-1 show increased amyloid beta-peptide deposition in cerebral blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This finding may be applicable to humans, since postmortem studies have found that TGF beta-1 mRNA levels correlate strongly with amyloid beta-peptide deposition in damaged blood vessels in patients with CAA.</p><p>A case-control genetic association study that included a prospective followup of 178 ICH survivors found that a variant within the CR1 gene (rs6656401) influences the risk and recurrence of CAA-related ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In the same report, this genetic variant was also associated with the severity of vascular amyloid deposition on pathologic examination of 544 autopsy studies from two community-based clinical-pathological studies of aging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGIC FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracerebral hemorrhage</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18353551\"><span class=\"h3\">Presenting features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common clinical manifestation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is spontaneous lobar hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50480\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50480 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] The term lobar refers to location in the cortex and subcortical white matter; this site is in contrast to the deep locations characteristic of hypertensive hemorrhage such as putamen, thalamus, and pons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The lobar location of the hemorrhages reflects the underlying distribution of the vascular amyloid deposits, which favor cortical vessels and largely spare white matter, deep gray matter, and the brainstem. The cerebellum contains variable amounts of vascular amyloid and may be a site of CAA-related hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. CAA-related hemorrhages are also more likely to arise in posterior brain regions. Analysis of the spatial distribution of 321 intracerebral hemorrhages on gradient echo MRI in 59 patients with probable CAA revealed that hemorrhages were significantly more likely to occur in the temporal and occipital than the frontal and parietal lobes (ratio of actual to expected hemorrhages 1.37, 1.43, 0.58, and 1.0, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The explanation for the posterior brain clustering of CAA hemorrhages is undetermined, but it may be related to as yet unknown characteristics of posterior circulation vessels that influence beta amyloid peptide elimination, or to increased vulnerability of these brain regions to minor trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Because of their superficial location, CAA-related hemorrhages often extend into the subarachnoid space, and less frequently rupture into ventricles. Despite extensive pathologic involvement of the leptomeningeal vessels, primary subarachnoid hemorrhage related to CAA is rare; however, superficial CAA-related bleeding can often be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18353892\" class=\"local\">'Hemosiderosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical presentation of CAA-related hemorrhage varies with the lesion's size and location. Large lobar hemorrhages, particularly those extending towards the ventricles, can cause hemiplegia and depressed consciousness; in comparison, smaller lobar hemorrhages can cause more limited focal deficits, seizure, or headache. Tiny asymptomatic hemorrhages appear to be common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>In addition to its role in spontaneous hemorrhage, CAA underlies a substantial proportion of hemorrhages related to thrombolytic or anticoagulant agents. In a series of warfarin-related lobar hemorrhages, for example, advanced CAA was present in 7 of 11 patients with available pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Similarly, the TIMI II trial evaluating the use of tissue-type plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction identified severe CAA at postmortem examination in two of five patients with intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The importance of CAA may contribute to the age-dependence of these medication-induced hemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18353733\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lobar hemorrhage in general is associated with features that are both favorable &mdash; their superficial location and tendency to spare the ventricles &mdash; and unfavorable to outcome &mdash; older age, and somewhat larger hematoma size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/12,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,41,42</a>]. Overall mortality in lobar hemorrhage due to CAA is in the range of 10 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>], with the best prognosis for patients with smaller hematomas (&lt;50 mL) and greater level of consciousness on admission (Glasgow coma scale &ge;8).</p><p>Although the acute outcome may be somewhat better in CAA-associated than in hypertensive hemorrhage, CAA carries a substantially higher risk of hemorrhage recurrence. A cohort of 71 consecutive survivors of lobar hemorrhage had a two year cumulative recurrence rate of 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. While in this series, recurrent hemorrhages were typically in a different location from the index hemorrhage, in another study, recurrent hemorrhages tended to arise in areas of prior hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Areas of high amyloid deposition on amyloid imaging appear to predict sites for future hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Other testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Age, sex, and hypertension did not predict recurrence; however, those patients with history of hemorrhage prior to study entry were at approximately six times the risk as those without a previous history. The risk for recurrent hemorrhages is even higher in those who have had more than one prior ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Recurrent hemorrhage is also more likely with increasing number of microhemorrhages and in patients with posterior white matter hypodensity on CT scan. As noted above, carriers of the &epsilon;2 or &epsilon;4 APOE alleles are also at increased risk compared to the more common APOE <span class=\"nowrap\">&epsilon;3/&epsilon;3</span> genotype (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Apolipoprotein E'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Microhemorrhages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging data suggest that small subclinical leaks of blood called cerebral microhemorrhages (also known as microbleeds) are relatively common in CAA. Gradient echo or T2*-weighted MRI can detect these remnants of hemorrhage as 2 to 10 mm focal or multifocal areas of hemosiderin deposition. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Gradient-echo MRI'</a> below.)</p><p>In population-based studies, cerebral microhemorrhages are detected in 5 to 23 percent of older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. The underlying age of the population studied and the sensitivity of the MRI techniques used probably account for some of the variability in the observed prevalences. While microhemorrhages in general are not specific to CAA, a distribution that primarily involves the cerebral cortex suggests CAA, while those that primarily arise from the basal ganglia, thalamus, or pons are believed to more likely result from hypertensive microangiopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The association between lobar microhemorrhages and APOE &epsilon;4 in the Rotterdam and other studies support the hypothesis that these lesions originate from CAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/18,47,48,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,47,48,50,51</a>]. &#160;Imaging studies have also associated the presence and distribution of microbleeds with concentrated amyloid deposition as seen on positron emission tomography using the amyloid ligand, Pittsburgh compound B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. </p><p>In the Rotterdam cohort, microbleeds were also more prevalent among those using antiplatelet agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In another case series, microbleeds were also found to be more common in patients with ICH associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use compared to those with ICH who did not use aspirin and compared to aspirin users without ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The findings in one report suggest that microhemorrhages arise from an amyloid-based pathology that is in some respects distinct from that of macrohemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Analysis of neuroimaging studies of 46 consecutive patients with CAA demonstrated a bimodal, rather than continuous, distribution of hemorrhage volumes. In a subset of patients who underwent autopsy, those with a large number of microbleeds had amyloid-positive vessels with thicker walls compared to those with a lower proportion of, or no microbleeds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18353892\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemosiderosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some evidence that superficial hemorrhage in the cortical sulci (typically referred to as hemosiderosis or superficial siderosis when chronic) can also represent a focus of bleeding related to CAA. Accumulation of evidence from small case series suggests an association between superficial siderosis and CAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. As examples, two retrospective studies found that superficial siderosis was commonly found in patients with CAA (40 to 60 percent), but was unusual in patients with ICH of other cause (0 to 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. In the latter study, superficial siderosis was found to occur in patients with or without lobar ICH, but appeared to be highly associated with transient neurologic symptoms.</p><p>Superficial siderosis can have a number of other unrelated causes (eg, prior trauma, vascular malformation). Disseminated superficial siderosis appeared to be a more specific finding for CAA in one study, but this requires independent confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient neurologic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A less common, but clinically important manifestation of CAA is transient neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Affected patients complain of recurrent, brief (minutes), often stereotyped spells of weakness, numbness, paresthesias, or other cortical symptoms that can spread smoothly over contiguous body parts. In one cohort, transient neurologic symptoms occurred in 14 percent of patients with CAA, and positive symptoms (positive visual aura, limb jerking) were as common as negative symptoms (vision loss, limb weakness, dysphasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>These episodes may reflect abnormal activity (either focal seizure or spreading depression) of the surrounding cortex in response to the small hemorrhages. The anecdotal observation that anticonvulsants may stop the attacks is consistent with this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In the above cohort, patients with transient neurologic symptoms were more likely to have superficial cortical siderosis or subarachnoid hemorrhage than did CAA patients without these symptoms (50 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Features that help distinguish these spells from true transient ischemic attacks include the smooth spread of the symptoms, the absence of hemodynamically significant stenosis in the relevant vascular supply, and the presence of small hemorrhage in the corresponding region of cortex (best shown with gradient-echo MRI; see below). Avoiding misdiagnosis is critical since the administration of anticoagulants for a presumed TIA can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke from CAA. In the same series, transient neurologic symptoms in a patient with CAA appeared to predict a high early risk of symptomatic ICH, which occurred in 50 percent of patients over a median followup period of 14 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Other entities to consider in the differential diagnosis of transient neurologic symptoms are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke&quot;, section on 'Transient neurologic events'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">CAA-related inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CAA-related inflammation appears to represent a distinct subset of CAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. The clinical presentation is that of acute or subacute cognitive decline rather than hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Seizures, headache, and focal neurologic signs are common. Viral and autoimmune encephalitis and cerebral neoplasm are sometimes considered in the differential diagnosis, as are other causes of rapidly progressive dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic studies in this setting typically include neuroimaging, brain biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, both to make a positive diagnosis of CAA-related inflammation as well to exclude other conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging shows a potentially reversible leukoencephalopathy consisting of patchy or confluent white matter hyperintensities on T2 weighted MRI sequences; multiple microhemorrhages are seen on gradient echo sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55227\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55227 \">image 2</a>).

CSF assay for anti-amyloid antibodies is not yet commercially available, but may eventually emerge as a diagnostic test. Clinical and radiographic improvement may occur with immunosuppressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/64,65,67,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65,67,74</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppression'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The syndrome of CAA-related perivascular inflammation appears to be closely linked to the reported Abeta-related angiitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>]. These two inflammatory syndromes, distinguished by the presence or absence of true vasculitis on neuropathological examination, appear to share similar clinical presentations, imaging properties, and response to treatment. The Abeta-related secondary vasculitis also resembles primary CNS vasculitis in its clinical presentation and response to immunosuppressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. &#160;There appears to be a spectrum of CAA-related autoimmune reaction that ranges from perivascular inflammation to a true vasculitis with inflammation within as well as around the vessel wall, with a corresponding range in clinical severity of its manifestations.

Cerebral amyloid burden was found to correlate with the volume of white matter hyperintensity in one cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other studies have correlated the number and presence of microbleeds in both population or hospital-based subjects with cognitive impairment and dementia, raising the possibility that these lesions are contributors to neurologic dysfunction, as well as markers of small vessel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. In one study of patients who underwent MRI because of TIA or stroke, a finding of lobar microhemorrhage, but not deep microhemorrhage, was associated with cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another potential mechanism for CAA-related cognitive dysfunction is infarction.

The presence of these lesions was associated with the hemorrhage burden, but not with conventional atherosclerotic risk factors, suggesting that the pathogenesis is related to CAA rather than to comorbid ischemic cerebrovascular disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finally, a functional MRI study of 25 nondemented patients with probable CAA found evidence of impaired vascular reactivity in response to visual stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. These findings were confirmed in another study which also noted that the fMRI response correlated negatively with the microbleed count and volume of white matter hyperintensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular dementia is discussed in more detail separately.

Another autopsy study found that patients with both CAA and AD had more severe cognitive impairment than patients with AD alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

According to proposed diagnostic criteria for CAA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53541 \">table 1</a>), the disease can be definitively diagnosed only by full postmortem examination of the brain. However, there are two approaches toward making the diagnosis of &quot;probable CAA&quot; during life: gradient-echo MRI and examination of tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Gradient-echo MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gradient-echo MRI accentuates the signal dropout caused by iron-containing deposits left by old hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81579\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81579 \">image 3</a>). Susceptibility-weighted MRI may be even more sensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>To make the diagnosis of probable CAA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53541 \">table 1</a>) with gradient-echo MRI, it is reasonable to look for the presence of two or more hemorrhages restricted to those regions typical of CAA (cortex or &quot;grey-white&quot; junction) and entirely sparing regions typical of hypertensive hemorrhage (basal ganglia, thalamus, or pons). These criteria are supported by both a limited amount of direct pathological correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>] and by more extensive correlation of APOE genotypes in clinically and pathologically diagnosed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Application of these criteria to a population of patients with hereditary CAA of the Dutch type, using DNA analysis as the gold standard, found an overall sensitivity of 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, nearly half of the mutation carriers were asymptomatic. Among symptomatic individuals with CAA, the sensitivity was 93 percent.</p><p>The gradient-echo images should be reviewed with some care, since lesions and structures other than intraparenchymal hemorrhage can produce signal dropout. These include hemosiderosis within a brain sulcus (a frequent consequence of subarachnoid extension of a lobar hemorrhage), flow-void from a cortical vessel, or adjacent air in the nasal sinuses. When establishing the presence of at least two hemorrhages, lesions that do not clearly represent independent hemorrhagic foci (for example, small blood deposits close to a larger hematoma) should not be counted.</p><p>Inclusion of microhemorrhages (or hemosiderosis) in the MRI criteria for probable MRI increases the sensitivity of the criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53541 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, it is important to note that the acceptance of only a single microhemorrhage as indicative of CAA may lead to erroneous assignment of nonamyloid microhemorrhages as CAA. Microbleeds may also occur in hypertensive microangiopathy and in infective endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>], although they tend to have a somewhat different anatomic distribution in these conditions.

In a study of 94 consecutive survivors of primary lobar hemorrhage, the three-year cumulative risk of recurrent hemorrhage for patients with one, two, three to five, and six or greater hemorrhages on the baseline gradient-echo MRI was 14, 17, 38, and 51 percent, respectively (hazard ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4 for each increase in category) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Higher numbers of hemorrhages also predicted a greater risk for future cognitive impairment, loss of functional independence, and death. Another study found that an incidental finding of multiple lobar microhemorrhages in an older adult was associated with a seven-fold risk of stroke-related death compared to individuals without lobar microhemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain biopsies are done rarely for the diagnosis of CAA, except in the setting of CAA-related inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].
