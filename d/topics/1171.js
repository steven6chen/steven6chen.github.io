Patients with inherited hemostatic disorders may report little bleeding, while others without inherited or acquired hemostatic abnormalities may report exaggerated tendencies to bleed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Given the variability in patients' perceptions of bleeding, as well as the lack of a uniform clinical measure of bleeding severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], a dialogue between the patient and physician is essential for the consideration of a bleeding diathesis. A careful assessment of the presenting complaint can provide important clues as to where a defect might reside in the hemostatic process and whether the defect is inherited or acquired, providing a rational approach to laboratory investigation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 1</a>). Use of a standardized bleeding assessment tool may help in the prospective evaluation of patients referred for hemostatic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a suspected bleeding disorder should be questioned about past bleeding problems, a history of iron-responsive anemia, bleeding outcomes following surgical procedures and tooth extractions, history of transfusion, character of menses, and dietary habits or antibiotic use which might predispose to vitamin K deficiency. The patient should also be questioned concerning the presence of thyroid, liver, and kidney disease. Complaints such as hematuria, melena, and menorrhagia are often less helpful, since structural causes are more commonly responsible than a bleeding diathesis.</p><p>The response to trauma is an excellent screening test. A history of surgical procedures or tooth extractions or significant injury without abnormal bleeding is good evidence against the presence of an inherited hemorrhagic disorder.</p><p>An inherited disorder is suggested by the onset of bleeding shortly after birth or during childhood and a positive family history with a consistent genetic pattern. Thus, hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) are characterized by X-linked recessive inheritance. However, a negative family history does not exclude an inherited coagulation disorder. As an example, up to 30 to 40 percent of patients with hemophilia A have a negative family history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Patient and family history'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful history of medication use is important, including prescribed medications, over-the-counter medications, and herbal products. Drug ingestion may be associated with a bleeding diathesis via a variety of mechanisms, such as the induction of thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction, aplastic anemia, or vascular purpura. In addition, some drugs can induce or exacerbate a coagulation disorder. Examples include platelet dysfunction induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other commonly used antiinflammatory drugs, beta-lactam antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a>, and the co-ingestion of drugs that may potentiate the anticoagulant effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>.

Mucosal bleeding may be manifest as epistaxis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gingival bleeding, and large bullous hemorrhages may appear on the buccal mucosa due to the lack of vessel protection afforded by the submucosal tissue. Bleeding into the skin is manifested as petechiae or superficial ecchymoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with platelet abnormalities tend to bleed immediately after vascular trauma and rarely experience delayed bleeding, which is more common in the coagulation disorders. The following are the types of bleeding most often associated with these disorders:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Petechiae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Petechiae are small capillary hemorrhages. They characteristically develop in crops in areas of increased venous pressure, such as the dependent parts of the body. As a result, they are most dense on the feet and ankles, fewer are present on the legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71480 \">picture 1</a>). Petechiae are not found on the sole of the foot where the vessels are protected by the strong subcutaneous tissue. They are asymptomatic and not palpable, and should be distinguished from small telangiectasias, angiomas, and vasculitic purpura.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Ecchymoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ecchymotic lesions characteristically are purple in color and are small, multiple, and superficial in location.

Postsurgical bleeding can be extensive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some patients with a coagulation disorder, the onset of bleeding after trauma may be delayed. As an example, bleeding after a tooth extraction may stop, only to recur in a matter of hours. The reason for this phenomenon and for the absence of petechiae or bleeding from small cuts or scratches is the preservation of normal platelet function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26266204\"><span class=\"h2\">The cardiac surgery patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the patient undergoing cardiac surgery can be difficult due to competing bleeding and thrombotic tendencies.

Tests of fibrinolysis include the measurement of fibrin split products and D-dimer levels. Assays for the less commonly seen bleeding disorders include alpha-2-antiplasmin activity, euglobulin clot lysis time, as well as tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigens.</p><p>Appropriate emergency laboratory testing for those with active bleeding is discussed separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet counting and the peripheral smear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelets may be counted directly or with the use of fully automated electronic methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-hematology-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated hematology instrumentation&quot;</a>.) While some automated methods may flag for the presence of unusually small or extremely large platelets, there is no substitute for direct examination of the peripheral blood smear for detection of quantitative as well as qualitative (ie, abnormalities of platelet size) platelet abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'CBC and peripheral smear examination'</a>.)</p><p>Examination of the peripheral blood smear is essential in patients with low platelet counts to exclude the presence of pseudothrombocytopenia due to in vitro platelet agglutination in the presence of EDTA&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68949 \">picture 2</a>). This phenomenon is thought to result from a &quot;naturally occurring&quot; platelet autoantibody directed against a normally concealed epitope on the platelet membrane, which becomes exposed by EDTA. Use of alternative anticoagulants (eg, citrate or heparin), may circumvent this technical problem. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bleeding time (BT) is a measure of the interaction of platelets with the blood vessel wall. A prolonged bleeding time may occur in thrombocytopenia (platelet count usually below <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL),</span> qualitative platelet abnormalities (eg, uremia), von Willebrand disease (VWD), some cases of vascular purpura, and severe fibrinogen deficiency, in which it is probably the result of platelet dysfunction. Among patients with a normal platelet count who are not taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, the bleeding time is used primarily to screen patients for inherited disorders of platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. An abnormal test in a patient with mucocutaneous bleeding would justify further testing for platelet dysfunction or specific tests for von Willebrand disease (VWD). However, a normal value for the BT should not preclude testing for VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. As will be discussed below, the Platelet Function Analyzer is more sensitive for detection of VWD than is the BT (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>A normal BT does not predict the safety of surgical procedures, nor does an abnormal BT predict for excessive bleeding. Since assessment of the BT is subject to considerable variation due to technical factors in executing the test, a normal range for the test varies from laboratory to laboratory, and cannot be generalized here. Of importance, the BT is <strong>not recommended</strong> as a preoperative screening test. Because of considerable variation due to technical factors in executing the test, the BT plays a limited role, if any,&nbsp;in evaluating hemostatic defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative assessment of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Bleeding time'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">The Platelet Function Analyzer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The commercially-available Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100) is an alternative technology that assesses platelet function with greater sensitivity and reproducibility than the bleeding time (BT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because the BT is insensitive, invasive, time consuming, and subject to variation due to technical factors, many centers have adopted the PFA-100 in place of the BT as their screening test of platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'The platelet function analyzer'</a>.)</p><p>This test may be performed on citrated samples of whole blood that have been stored at room temperature, and is considerably faster to perform than platelet aggregation studies. Normal PFA-100 test results may obviate the need for further expensive platelet function testing. Unlike the in vivo BT, the PFA-100 test does not provide a measure of vascular function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Prothrombin time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The production of fibrin via the extrinsic pathway and the final common pathway (common to both extrinsic and intrinsic cascades) requires tissue thromboplastin (tissue factor), factor VII (extrinsic pathway), and factors X, V, prothrombin (factor II), and fibrinogen. The functioning of these pathways is measured by the plasma prothrombin time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998 \">figure 1</a>). The test bypasses the intrinsic pathway and uses thromboplastins to substitute for platelets. Within this combined pathway, factors VII, X, and prothrombin are vitamin-K dependent and are altered by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. For this reason, the PT is used as a measure of the anticoagulant activity of warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Prothrombin time (PT) and INR'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Activated partial thromboplastin time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measures the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998 \">figure 1</a>). It is called partial since platelet substitutes are used which are only partial thromboplastins; they are incapable of activating the extrinsic pathway, which requires complete tissue thromboplastin (tissue factor). In the original method, a glass test tube provided contact activation. However, the addition of activators such as ellagic acid or particulate silicates provided better and more standardized contact activation. This activated version of the PTT (aPTT) is now the routine assay used to evaluate intrinsic coagulation and the degree of heparin anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)'</a>.)</p><p>The aPTT is sensitive to inhibitors such as heparin and to deficiencies of all coagulation factors except factors VII and XIII. It is less sensitive than the PT to deficiencies of the common pathway (factors X and V, prothrombin, and fibrinogen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. High levels of a single factor (eg, factor VIII) can shorten the aPTT. However, an association between a short aPTT and a hypercoagulable state remains controversial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombin time and reptilase time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thrombin time (TT) and reptilase time (RT) measure conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin monomers and the formation of initial clot by thrombin and reptilase, respectively. Reptilase, a thrombin-like snake enzyme, differs from thrombin by generating fibrinopeptide A but not fibrinopeptide B from fibrinogen and by resisting inhibition by heparin via antithrombin. Fibrin strand cross-linking, which is mediated by factor XIII, is not measured by these assays.</p><p>Prolonged thrombin times and reptilase times may be due to hypofibrinogenemia, structurally abnormal fibrinogens (dysfibrinogens), or increased fibrin split products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Since heparin prolongs the TT but not the RT, the RT is useful for determining if heparin is the cause of a prolonged TT. Alternatively, one can test for heparin activity via its anti-factor Xa activity, or with the use of a commercial heparinase.

The first step is measurement of the platelet count, which is done as part of the routine complete blood count (CBC) in most institutions. If a platelet count was not performed recently, this should be obtained. Spontaneous bleeding generally does not occur with a platelet count greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL,</span> but any platelet count abnormality should be addressed, as discussed in detail separately.

Examples include von Willebrand disease (VWD), in which reduced levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) lead to impaired binding of platelets to the endothelium; and inherited platelet function disorders, in which platelets do not respond to usual hemostatic cues. Appropriate initial testing includes testing for VWD and tests for platelet defects, which may include review of the peripheral blood smear, bleeding time, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PFA-100 testing. The extent of testing and the order in which tests are performed depend on the individual patient history and may vary among experts.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning#H1569311674\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of rodenticide poisoning&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulants (superwarfarins and warfarins)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticoagulant-rodenticide-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired disorders with multiple abnormalities which produce this pattern include vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Differentiating among these possibilities may be difficult. The following may help in distinguishing among these conditions:<br/><br/>In both liver disease and vitamin K deficiency, there is deficient synthesis of factors II, VII, IX and X. Since factor V production is independent of vitamin K status, low factor V levels can be used as evidence for either reduced hepatic synthetic function or increased consumption, as in DIC. Since factor VIII production is independent of vitamin K status and this factor is not manufactured by hepatocytes, factor VIII levels are usually normal or increased in liver disease. Thus, low levels of factor VIII would favor a diagnosis of DIC in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Liver disease versus DIC'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired inhibitors of factor V have been described, at times in association with topical bovine thrombin therapy. Acquired antibodies to bovine thrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> factor V contaminating bovine thrombin preparations may cross-react with endogenous human factor V as well as with human thrombin. Effects of these antibodies on PT, aPTT, and TT testing can vary, and associated risks of bleeding, which can be severe, are unpredictable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;, section on 'Factor V inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The first step in the evaluation of patients with a prolonged PT and aPTT should be to exclude or identify an abnormality of fibrinogen. This can be achieved by measurement of the plasma fibrinogen concentration and the thrombin time, and testing for increased amounts of D-dimer or <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrin/fibrinogen</span> degradation products (FDP). In patients with an inherited coagulation disorder and normal amounts of fibrinogen, deficiencies of factor V, factor X, and prothrombin can be diagnosed by specific factor assays. In patients with an acquired disorder, the likely diagnosis, in the absence of heparin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, and fibrinogen abnormalities, is vitamin K deficiency or liver disease.</p><p>Acquired inhibitors to prothrombin and factor X are extremely rare. Acquired factor X deficiency may be seen in patients with primary amyloidosis, and results from the binding of factor X to amyloid fibrils.
