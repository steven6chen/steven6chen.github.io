For example, a combination of chemically-treated gear and clothing and a strong chemical repellent may be necessary in areas with high concentrations of disease-carrying arthropods (<a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/the-pre-travel-consultation/protection-against-mosquitoes-ticks-other-arthropods&amp;token=lD6tmodJK5K69kHOdFd/EyqqL9u7wYJbnANSZpUsjd/sjqbt+KuNRrSSw6wkOonr21A3xpuv/0Ip2kUOhTXX0J9CfRkrd+vEz7qxuZBzqMO9yeU7orkGBTjQYZg/uXZj7x114lfj4joEyr5UJGuVVA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4085\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Protection against mosquitoes, ticks, and other arthropods</a>). In contrast, milder repellents may be sufficient for preventing nuisance bites in areas with low levels of disease vectors. The phylum Arthropoda includes both insects and arachnids, although the terms &quot;arthropod&quot; and &quot;insect&quot; are used interchangeably in this topic review.</p><p>Repellents are variably useful in deterring mosquitoes, biting flies, fleas, midges, chiggers, and ticks.</p><p>Repellents are not effective against stinging insects, such as Hymenoptera species (yellow jackets, wasps, bees, hornets, imported fire ants, and harvester ants) or against spiders. Unlike blood-sucking arthropods, stinging insects and spiders do not seek out humans to feed.

Others antagonize olfactory receptors and actively reverse a normally attractive scent into a deterring scent. Due to highly divergent receptors, the same compound may act as an agonist in one species and an antagonist in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Proper application</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/insect-repellents/repellent-treated-clothing&amp;token=1vFBO8cD1+j+oweb8rgw1KhnRlP8Sa1W3PlZcCTxkjYBnjdXk3k7E0gJaFcpRu6ZZJfDdhm2nW2Hi2Dw/RcmYK8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4085\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Guidelines</a> regarding the safe and effective use of insect repellents in order to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects were issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These are particularly important when using DEET-based repellents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use just enough repellent to lightly cover but not saturate the skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repellents should be applied to exposed skin, clothing, or both, but not under clothing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thin layer can be applied to the face by dispensing repellent into the palms, rubbing hands together, and then applying to the face.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repellent should be washed from the palms after application to prevent contact with the eyes, mouth, and genitals.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use repellents over cuts, wounds, inflamed, irritated, or eczematous skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not inhale aerosols, spray them in enclosed spaces or near food, or get them into the eyes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not apply insect repellent to the hands of small children, as it will inevitably be rubbed into the eyes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent reapplication of repellent is unnecessary.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The areas treated with repellent should be washed with soap and water once the repellent is no longer needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If both sunscreen and repellent are being applied, sunscreen should be applied first and repellent should be applied after.

DEET has been in use for nearly 70 years and is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; of insect repellents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. No other compound covers as broad a spectrum of arthropods or offers the extended duration of action of DEET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In addition, there are microencapsulated formulations (eg, 3M Ultrathon), which increase the period of evaporation (and hence repellency) while reducing absorption by the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These products have made it possible to decrease the concentration of DEET without sacrificing its duration of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p>DEET is available in many products, in concentrations ranging from less than 10 percent to more than 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The effectiveness of DEET plateaus at approximately 30 percent, but higher concentrations provide longer durations of protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Products with concentrations around 10 percent are effective for periods of approximately two hours; a concentration of about 24 percent provides an average of five hours of protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Protection is shortened by swimming, washing, rainfall, sweating, and wiping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A prudent approach is to select the lowest concentration effective for the amount of time spent outdoors. Products with 10 to 35 percent DEET are adequate in most circumstances. Higher concentrations should be reserved for situations in which insect infestation is high, elevated temperatures and humidity may limit evaporation, or time outdoors will exceed three to four hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77726653\"><span class=\"h4\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious adverse reactions to DEET are uncommon, and the rare reported cases resulted from oral ingestion or other massive exposures, usually in children. However, excessive absorption through the skin can cause dermatitis, allergic reactions, and rare neurotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. DEET is not carcinogenic.</p><p>DEET can damage some plastics as well as clothes made from synthetic fibers such as spandex or rayon, and some patients dislike the oily and sticky skin sensation that DEET can cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4871474\"><span class=\"h4\">Interference with sunscreens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repellents containing DEET may reduce the efficacy of sunscreens applied simultaneously, although the labeling of combined products containing both components should have taken this into account and the sunscreen component should provide the stated sun protection factor. These combination products are not recommended for use in children, as discussed in the following section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3398536086\"><span class=\"h4\">Use in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Used as directed, DEET appears to be safe for children older than two months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, adverse neurologic effects, such as encephalopathy, have been reported with massive exposure and chronic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Overall, fewer than 20 cases have been reported worldwide and each developed in the setting of inappropriate use (oral ingestion or repeated exposure to high concentrations) with at least three fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in a child following the inhalation of a DEET-containing insect repellent has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>We agree with the recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that children younger than two months of age should not use products with DEET. For older infants and children, repellents with 10 to 30 percent DEET should be safe and effective when used according to the directions on the product labels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>].</p><p>Products containing both DEET and sunscreen are not recommended for children because reapplication (as may be necessary for the sunscreen component) will result in an excessive exposure to DEET. DEET-containing sunscreens should not be reapplied and should be washed off when back indoors or protection is no longer needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4230245781\"><span class=\"h4\">Pregnant women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommendations for DEET use in pregnant and lactating women do not differ from those for nonpregnant adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised pregnant women to take precautions to reduce their risk of acquiring arboviral infections (eg, Zika virus, West Nile virus) by avoiding mosquito bites through use of protective clothing (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a>-treated) and DEET-based repellents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Topically-applied DEET does not pose hazards to the developing fetus, regardless of gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. First trimester exposure of rats and rabbits to DEET did not result in an increased risk of malformations in offspring, although one study using a dose several-fold higher than the normal human dose reported an increase in low birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There are no human data for first trimester exposure. A double-blind, randomized, therapeutic trial of insect repellents for the prevention of malaria in 897 pregnant women did not find any adverse neurologic, gastrointestinal, or dermatologic effects in women who applied a median total DEET dose of 214 g per pregnancy (range = 0 to 345 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. No adverse effects were noted on <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/infant</span> survival, growth, or development up to one year of age. DEET was detected in four cord blood samples from a randomly selected subgroup of 50 DEET users.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Picaridin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Picaridin (Saltidin, Icaridin, KBR 3023), a plant-derived piperidine compound, is effective against mosquitoes, ticks, and the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. This agent has been successfully used for years in Europe and Australia. In the United States, it is available in a 20 percent solution (Sawyer Picaridin Insect Repellent) as well as in a 7 or 15 percent solution (as Cutter Advanced and Cutter Advanced Sport, respectively).</p><p>Higher concentrations of picaridin (eg, 20 percent) have similar efficacy to DEET when used for short periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].

In the United States, PMD is available as 65 percent PMD (Repel Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent Lotion and Spray Lotion and Survivor Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent) and 10 percent PMD (Off!
