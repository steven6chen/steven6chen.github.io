Humans and other animals can also become infected, usually after being bitten by a mosquito that previously bit an infected bird.</p><p>WN virus was first discovered in Uganda in 1937, but it became a household term in the United States in 1999 when the first cases were reported in New York City [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Human cases of WN virus disease have occurred in all 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Outbreaks have also been reported in a number of other regions, including Canada, Europe, Israel, Greece, and Russia. Although there is evidence that the virus has spread throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, few human cases have been reported from these areas.</p><p>WN virus is a seasonal epidemic in the United States, lasting from summer through fall, with a peak in activity around mid-August to early September. The duration is longer in milder climates, where mosquitoes can emerge earlier in the year and survive longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WEST NILE VIRUS RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mosquito bites increase the risk of contracting West Nile (WN) virus, particularly during the summer in an area where WN virus activity has been reported. However, the chances of contracting WN virus after a mosquito bite vary, depending upon the time of year and geographic location. About 1 in 4 people who become infected will become ill. However, only about 1 in 230 (less than 1 percent) who become infected develops severe symptoms due to involvement of the brain or spinal cord. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Simple measures to avoid being bitten can reduce the risk of acquiring WN virus (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'West Nile virus prevention'</a> below). People over the age of 50 are encouraged to take extra precautions because they are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms of WN virus if they become infected.</p><p>WN virus can also be acquired from a blood transfusion or organ transplant. However, the risk from blood transfusion is very low because testing for WN virus is routinely done. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Blood transfusion and organ transplant recipients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WEST NILE VIRUS TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all cases of West Nile (WN) virus are contracted through the bite of a mosquito carrying the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bird-mosquito-human cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a bird is infected with WN virus, the virus can circulate in its blood for several days; a mosquito that feeds on it during this period may become a carrier of the virus. If the mosquito later bites a person, the virus can be injected from the insect's salivary glands into the person's blood. Mosquitos who are carriers also spread WN virus to other uninfected birds via bites.</p><p>Because birds are the primary hosts of the disease, they have high levels of virus. Therefore, contact with birds that are dead or ill should be avoided, and the local health department should be contacted for instructions.</p><p>WN virus is <strong>not</strong> spread through touching, kissing, or sharing utensils with a person with the infection, or through contact with a healthcare provider who has treated patients with the virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnant and nursing women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nationwide study has indicated that fetal abnormalities are uncommon following maternal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pregnant women who believe they have been infected with the virus should contact their doctor for further evaluation and advice. Testing for WN virus is not recommended for pregnant women who have no symptoms of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is believed that WN virus may be passed from an infected mother to her baby through breast milk. This is based on only one case, in which a baby tested positive for the virus but did not develop any symptoms. There are many known benefits to breastfeeding and experts continue to recommend breastfeeding for women with known or suspected WN virus infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pregnant and breastfeeding women should take extra precautions to avoid mosquito bites, especially in areas where WN virus has been reported. A discussion of the safety and use of insect repellents in pregnant and breastfeeding women can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/faq/repellent.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsRDO3DLPulkjUEDt6n/67n3ui7+Mnyw0XlXQn3TmRTts4fTzTtgjZW9bRZN1Fuv3BA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=566\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website</a>. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'West Nile virus prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood transfusion and organ transplant recipients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A limited number of people have acquired WN virus after receiving donated blood or organs. Since 2003, all blood donations are screened for WN virus to identify infected blood. It is not possible to contract the virus by donating blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donation-and-transfusion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Blood donation and transfusion (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">WEST NILE VIRUS SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people infected with West Nile (WN) virus never develop symptoms and will not know that they have the virus. The virus remains in the body for a few days before the immune system begins to fight the infection and eliminate it. Individuals that become ill generally exhibit symptoms within two to 15 days of acquiring the virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">West Nile fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 25 percent of people who contract WN virus develop West Nile fever. This is a self-limited illness, usually characterized by fever, headache, tiredness, back pain, muscle aches, decreased appetite, and rash. Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</p><p>These symptoms typically last from a few days to several weeks. However, several studies suggest that it may take one month or longer for all symptoms to disappear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Prolonged fatigue is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of people infected with WN virus (less than 1 percent) develop severe neuroinvasive disease, in which the virus travels through the blood and infects the brain and spinal cord. Although people of all ages may acquire severe disease, people over age 50 are at higher risk for severe disease and should take extra precautions to avoid mosquitoes. Severe disease in children is uncommon. People with certain types of advanced cancer and those taking immunosuppressive medication after organ transplantation are at very high risk of severe disease after WN virus infection.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of severe disease include headache and fever, as well as disorientation, convulsions, muscle weakness, coma, and paralysis. These symptoms can last for several weeks and long-lasting neurological abnormalities can develop.</p><p>At one year, less than 40 percent of patients with severe disease achieve a full recovery; full recovery is most likely to occur in people who are less than 65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Long-term neurologic abnormalities include muscle weakness, loss of concentration, confusion, and light-headedness, which continues to affect many people at 18 months. Recovery from severe disease is variable; some severely ill patients having complete or nearly complete recovery. Only about one-third of patients with paralysis will fully recover. In about 10 percent of cases, severe neuroinvasive disease results in death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">WEST NILE VIRUS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any health concern, possible symptoms of West Nile (WN) virus should be discussed with and evaluated by a healthcare provider. The provider will review the person's history to determine the likelihood that he or she has contracted the virus (eg, whether the patient lives in or has visited an area with WN virus activity; recent exposure to mosquitoes).</p><p>If a person's symptoms and history suggest that they have WN virus infection, blood is drawn for testing, particularly when severe disease is present. The most common test for WN virus detects the presence of antibodies (proteins) in the blood. Antibodies are produced in response to a foreign substance, such as a bacterium or virus. If antibodies are detected, it is a strong indication that the person has been infected with WN virus. Blood tests in patients with WN fever may be negative if blood is drawn within the first week of illness; later testing can help confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>For most people with neuroinvasive disease from WN virus, a blood test for WN virus is positive within about one week of the first symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain) can also be tested if neuroinvasive disease is suspected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">WEST NILE VIRUS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, West Nile fever generally improves on its own. Severe disease may require hospitalization for monitoring and support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus, although research is underway to develop treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">WEST NILE VIRUS PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basic preventive measures are recommended during mosquito season for people living in areas where West Nile (WN) virus is prevalent. The best way to avoid contracting the virus is to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquitoes tend to be most active at dawn and dusk, so extra vigilance is required at these times. While outdoors, insect repellents containing DEET, picardin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, 2-undecanone, and IR3535 are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Long pants and long sleeves will also minimize skin exposure. Applying permethrin to clothing (not skin) can further reduce the risk of insect bites. Bug zappers, sonic devices, and mosquito traps have not been shown to reduce the risk of WN virus infection.</p><p>Community mosquito control programs use several methods to reduce the mosquito population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When there is an outbreak or impending outbreak, large areas may be sprayed with mosquito-killing chemicals to rapidly reduce the mosquito population. Very small amounts of chemicals are required for this, so individual exposures are negligible and environmental impact is minimized. Individuals can help to reduce the number of mosquitos by draining areas of standing water (eg, buckets, bird baths, gutters, wading pools, and pet dishes), where mosquitoes frequently lay eggs. Ensuring that all windows and doors have good quality screens also helps keep mosquito exposure to a minimum.</p><p>There is currently no human vaccine for WN virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birds are the primary hosts of the West Nile (WN) virus; the virus can be spread when a mosquito bites an infected bird and then bites a human or animal.
