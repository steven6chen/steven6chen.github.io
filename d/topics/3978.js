(See <a href=\"#H3610532073\" class=\"local\">'Infection versus disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMV disease is characterized by evidence of CMV infection with attributable symptoms or signs; CMV disease may manifest as either a viral syndrome with fever, malaise, leukopenia, neutropenia, atypical lymphocytosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia or as tissue-invasive disease. (See <a href=\"#H3610532073\" class=\"local\">'Infection versus disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spectrum of CMV infections range from asymptomatic viremia (CMV infection) to CMV disease manifested as a viral syndrome or as tissue invasive disease, most commonly pneumonitis. (See <a href=\"#H709584835\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom CMV infection or disease is suspected should undergo testing of the blood for CMV replication. We favor using a whole blood, quantitative polymerase chain reaction&ndash;based assay. In addition to testing for CMV viremia in the peripheral blood, patients suspected of having invasive disease, such as pneumonitis, should undergo bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H709584842\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H709588897\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of CMV disease generally involves antiviral therapy, typically with oral vanganciclovir or intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, and reduction of immunosuppression when feasible. (See <a href=\"#H709584933\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of active disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H837965841\" class=\"local\">'Reduction of immunosuppression'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All lung transplant recipients with severe disease require antiviral therapy with an agent that has activity against CMV. We recommend that such patients be treated with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> rather than oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The dosing of ganciclovir is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours, with dose adjustment for renal insufficiency. In addition to antiviral therapy, we suggest administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytomegalovirus immune globulin</a> (CytoGam) to patients with severe disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H240597688\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with nonsevere CMV infection or disease, we suggest anti-CMV treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is done to prevent progression to severe disease and to prevent the indirect effects of CMV. For such patients, we recommend oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> rather than IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> provided that the patient is expected to have adequate absorption of oral medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The dosing of valganciclovir is 900 mg orally twice daily, with dose adjustment for renal insufficiency. For patients who are expected to have poor absorption of oral medications (eg, moderate to severe CMV gastrointestinal involvement with nausea and vomiting or diarrhea), we use IV ganciclovir at a dose of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours, with dose adjustment for renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H709588918\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral therapy for viremia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H709588932\" class=\"local\">'Nonsevere disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> resistance, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
