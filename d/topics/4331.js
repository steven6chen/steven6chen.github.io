Sometimes, women choose to stop breastfeeding when they have these problems. But most problems can be treated so that women can keep breastfeeding.</p><p>Some common breastfeeding problems and their treatments are listed below. Women can do many of the treatments on their own. Some women also find it helpful to work with a breastfeeding expert, called a &quot;lactation consultant,&quot; when they have problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044401\"><span class=\"h1\">Engorgement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Engorgement is the term doctors use for when the breasts are too full of milk. When the breasts are engorged, a baby can have trouble with &quot;latch-on.&quot; Latch-on is another word for when a baby makes a tight seal with his or her mouth around the nipple and the dark skin around the nipple (areola) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69241 \">figure 1</a>). Breasts that are engorged can be swollen, hard, warm, and painful.</p><p>The only proven way to deal with engorgement is to use your hand or a breast pump to let some milk out between feedings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73810 \">figure 2</a>). But don't let too much milk out or pump for more than 2 to 5 minutes. Pumping for too long or releasing too much milk can make engorgement worse.</p><p>You can also try the following home remedies to reduce the pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a cold pack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a warm shower</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gently massage your breasts to start your milk flow</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044408\"><span class=\"h1\">Sore or painful nipples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some nipple soreness is normal during the first minute of each breastfeeding session. Nipple pain that lasts the whole breastfeeding session is usually not normal. It can be caused by nipple cracks, blisters, or bruises. Nipple pain can happen for different reasons, such as when a baby does not have a good latch-on. It can also happen if a baby has a condition called &quot;tongue-tie,&quot; which is when the tongue cannot move as freely as it should.</p><p>The most important thing you can do to prevent and deal with nipple pain is to make sure your baby latches on the right way (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69241 \">figure 1</a>). If your baby has tongue-tie, he or she might need surgery to release the tongue.</p><p>You can also try the following home remedies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your nipples are cracked or raw, you can try <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanolin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lanolin</a> ointment (sample brand name: Lansinoh). If you think your nipple might be infected, call your doctor or nurse. Do <strong>not</strong> use vitamin E or honey on your nipples, because these can be dangerous for your baby. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply a cool or warm wash cloth on your nipples</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a mild pain reliever, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear breast pads between feedings to protect your nipples.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your baby is biting you, position the baby so that his or her mouth is wide open during feedings. That will make it harder to bite. Also, stick your finger between your nipple and the baby's mouth any time he or she bites you and firmly say &quot;no.&quot; Then put the baby down in a safe place. The baby will learn not to bite you.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044415\"><span class=\"h1\">Blocked milk ducts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A blocked milk duct can cause a red and painful breast lump (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70540 \">picture 1</a>). It can also cause a white plug at the end of the nipple.</p><p>If you have a blocked milk duct, try to breastfeed often. Make sure that your baby empties your breasts during feedings. Start with the breast that has the blocked milk duct, and use different breastfeeding positions to try to get the breasts as empty as possible. To help your milk flow better, you can also try taking a warm shower or gently massage the breast.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044422\"><span class=\"h1\">Breast infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A breast infection is called &quot;mastitis.&quot; Mastitis can cause a fever and a hard, red, and swollen area of the breast. Women can also have muscle aches or chills.</p><p>You do not need to stop breastfeeding if you have mastitis.</p><p>To treat your mastitis, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage your breasts during feedings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a breast pump to empty your breasts after feedings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take antibiotic medicines, if your doctor prescribes them.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044429\"><span class=\"h1\">Nipple color changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nipples can turn white, blue, or red, and be painful. This can happen when the blood vessels in the nipples become narrow.</p><p>To treat this, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turn up the room temperature and wear warm clothes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a warm cloth over your breasts before and after breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking (smoking can make this problem worse).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid drinks and foods with caffeine (caffeine can make this problem worse).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop taking medicines that cause the blood vessels to become narrow.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines, if your doctor prescribes them.</p><p/><p>Nipple color changes and pain can also happen if a baby doesn't have a good latch-on or doesn't breastfeed in the right position. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044436\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talk with your doctor or nurse if you have problems with breastfeeding. Be sure to let him or her know if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blocked milk duct that does not get better after 3 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever and a hard, red, and swollen area of the breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood leaking from the nipples </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain that lasts for the whole breastfeeding session</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044548\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weaning from breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-health-and-nutrition-during-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Maternal health and nutrition during breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
