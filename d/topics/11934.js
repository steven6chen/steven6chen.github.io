Infants who had a positive test for a respiratory virus had a longer length of stay (70 versus 35 days) and more prolonged ventilatory support (51 versus 13 days), and were more likely to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia than infants without viral detection. The high frequency of viral detection and its associated consequences suggest that infection was present despite the absence of the usual clinical indicators of infection in many of the infants.

Of the 51 identified viral infections, three were due to intrauterine infections due to rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex.

It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus and a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. Two subtypes, A and B, are simultaneously present in most outbreaks, with subtype A typically causing more severe disease.

PIV is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus belonging to the genus <em>paramyxovirus</em> in the Paramyxoviridae family. Although there are four major serologic types that cause disease in humans, parainfluenza type 3 is the type most often implicated in neonatal nosocomial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nosocomial-viral-infections-in-the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit/abstract/14,15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,17-20</a>].
