In patients with AIDS and other immunodeficiencies, it is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause watery diarrhea and weight loss. Like other enteric pathogens such as <em>Cryptosporidium</em> and <em>Cyclospora</em>, <em>C. belli</em> is a coccidian, unicellular protozoan parasite that primarily infects the intestinal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Cystoisospora belli</em> is found worldwide, but infections are more common in tropical and subtropical areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In India, <em>Cystoisospora</em> infections are the most common parasitic cause of diarrhea in HIV-infected subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Among HIV-infected patients living in France, <em>Cystoisospora</em> infections were seen more commonly among patients who had emigrated from sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Gastrointestinal infections secondary to <em>Cystoisospora</em> are uncommon in the United States, but can be acquired by travelers to endemic countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In a study of more than 16,000 HIV-infected patients between 1985 and 1992 in Los Angeles County, the prevalence of <em>Cystoisospora</em> infections was highest in foreign-born patients, particularly those from Mexico and El Salvador, and among persons of Hispanic ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. <em>Cystoisospora</em> can also be identified as a copathogen with other enteric organisms, such as <em>Enterocytozoon bieneusi</em>, in geographic regions with high levels of fecal contamination of surface water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, a history of treatment or prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> for Pneumocystis infection in an HIV-infected patient is associated with a decreased risk of developing cystoisosporiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. </p><p><em>Cystoisospora</em> has also been reported in immunocompetent patients as well as in patients with other cellular immunodeficiencies, such as human T-lymphotropic type 1 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], lymphoblastic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It has also been reported in patients taking immunomodulators such as TNF-inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections are acquired by the ingestion of sporulated oocysts from food or water contaminated with human feces. After ingestion, the parasite invades enterocytes within the small intestine. The parasite completes its life cycle within the human host and immature oocysts are excreted in stool. </p><p>Sexual transmission through oral-anal contact has been suggested, but is unlikely since oocysts must exist outside the host for one to two days before sporulation, which is the infective phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Person-to-person transmission does not appear to be common; in a study of HIV-infected patients with <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection in Haiti, none of the 170 immunocompetent spouses or siblings cohabitating with the source patients had evidence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal manifestation of <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection is a watery, nonbloody diarrheal illness of sudden onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Commonly seen associated symptoms include malaise, anorexia, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, and dehydration. Fever may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with steatorrhea secondary to malabsorption may complain of malodorous stool. <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection has also been associated with acalculous cholecystitis in immunocompetent and immunodeficient patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>] and with reactive arthritis in the HIV-infected host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The clinical course of <em>Cystoisospora</em> infections varies with the immune status of the host. While symptoms are usually self-limited in the immunocompetent host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], cystoisosporiasis is often a chronic, debilitating diarrheal infection in immunocompromised hosts, who may relapse without long-term antibiotic suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22</a>]. In patients with AIDS, untreated infection is associated with protracted clinical course with severe diarrhea and weight loss, clinically indistinguishable from cryptosporidiosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. The secretory stool output can also lead to severe volume loss, renal insufficiency, and electrolyte disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H934725\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the general rule that protozoan infections do not elicit blood eosinophilia, increases in circulating eosinophils can occur with <em>Cystoisospora</em> infections and are sufficiently common to raise the possibility of this diagnosis. </p><p>Secretory diarrhea may lead to hypokalemia, bicarbonate wasting, and increased creatinine secondary to volume loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with secretory diarrhea usually have elevated stool osmolality and fecal fats noted on special stains (eg, Sudan III stain) consistent with steatorrhea.

Histologic alterations in the mucosa include shortened villi, crypt hyperplasia, and increases in infiltrating plasma cells, lymphocytes, and granulocytes. On occasion, organisms have been found at autopsy in extraintestinal sites, including the tracheobronchial lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and biliary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection is usually made by detecting oocysts in the feces. When seen, oocysts of <em>Cystoisospora</em> are thin-walled and ellipsoidal in form. They are usually 23 to 36 &mu;m by 12 to 17 &mu;m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In cases of heavy infection, oocysts can be seen on a simple wet mount of stool. However, as with <em>Cryptosporidia</em> and <em>Cyclospora</em>, <em>Cystoisospora</em> usually cannot be detected by routine stool ova and parasite examinations. Thus, acid-fast staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or specific fluorescent techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] must be requested when <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/1,16,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,27</a>]. A real-time PCR assay has been developed for detecting <em>Cystoisospora</em> DNA in fecal samples, but is not generally available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>If the stool examination is not diagnostic, parasites may also be detected in duodenal aspirates or within intestinal biopsy tissue examined under light microscopy; morphologically, <em>Cystoisospora</em> resembles <em>Cyclospora</em> on histologic sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In an immunocompromised patient, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and <em>Enterocytozoon bieneusi</em> should also be considered.</p><p><em>Cholera</em> is usually not confused with the other pathogens because of its rapid onset and epidemiology (ie, massive outbreaks in areas of poor sanitation). <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em> and <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> may sometimes be distinguished by their association with bloody diarrhea. A history of recent antibiotic exposure would suggest <em>Clostridium difficile</em>. <em>Giardia</em> is a small bowel pathogen associated with significant flatus and upper gastrointestinal symptoms without blood in the stool. Viral pathogens, such as rotavirus and Norwalk can also cause watery diarrhea, but are self-limited, even in the immunocompromised host.</p><p><em>Cryptosporidium</em> infection is difficult to distinguish clinically from <em>Cystoisospora</em>, but on microscopic examination, the latter parasites have a smaller round morphology with a size of approximately 4 to 6 micrometers; each parasite also contains four sporozoites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Noninfectious causes of severe diarrhea include inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, motility disorders, neuroendocrine tumors, villous adenoma, niacin deficiency, and laxative abuse.
