When a child presents with headache, it is important to determine whether the cause is due to primary disorder, as in migraine or tension-type headache (TTH) versus secondary, due to a brain lesion or infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54034\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54034 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>This topic will review TTH in children.

TTH is not accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Either photophobia or phonophobia may be present (but not both). The headache is not aggravated by routine physical activity. The term &quot;tension-type headache&quot; replaces the previous terms &quot;muscle contraction headache&quot; and &quot;tension headache&quot;.</p><p>The overlap of some of these symptoms with those of migraine can make differentiation between the two headache types difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12875674\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The current classification distinguishes three subforms of TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infrequent episodic (&lt;1 headache day per month on average, occurring &lt;12 days per year)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent episodic (1 to 14 headache days per month on average, occurring &ge;12 and &lt;180 days per year)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic (&ge;15 headache days per month)</p><p/><p>Diagnostic criteria are discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F79672\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79672 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68892 \">table 3</a>).

However, studies focusing on TTH in children and adolescents are limited, and the proposed mechanism is based on research in adults. These reports suggest a genetic and gender susceptibility to pain that involves both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Heightened sensitivity of pain triggered by stress or emotion suggests activation of nociceptive pathways in the central nervous system, including pathways mediated by serotonin and endogenous neuropeptides. Peripheral activation of nerve and striatal muscle may also occur. Neurotransmitters and many related neuromodulators such as nitric oxide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, neurokinin A, glutamate, serotonin, beta-endorphin, and met-enkephalin have all been implicated in triggering nociceptive systems leading to pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The earlier concept of muscle contraction producing vasoconstriction and ischemia is no longer considered the most important factor in pathogenesis. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately.

A review of population-based studies reported that the prevalence of TTH in children was approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In individual studies, the overall prevalence of pediatric TTH is between 11 to 73 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>], while the prevalence of chronic TTH ranges from 0.1 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/15,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,19</a>]. This wide variation among studies is likely due to different diagnostic criteria and varying methods of data collection, as well as differences among populations involving school-age children, with limited data on children under the age of 7 years.</p><p>The prevalence of TTH increases with age and is higher in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. In one survey of more than 37,000 Dutch children 12 to 18 years of age, the incidence of headache (including all types) in girls was twice that of boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Most reports in children suggest that TTH is two to three times more common than migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/13,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,24</a>]. As an example, a study of nearly 4000 Finnish schoolchildren found that 26 percent had a history of TTH, compared with 10 percent with migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of infrequent, frequent, and chronic TTH are similar. The headache is typically bifrontal, although band-like or temporal pain can occur. The pain usually is described as a continuous pressure, although the intensity may vary. Light-headedness and fatigue may occur. TTH is generally considered to be less painful than migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Daily activities, such as school attendance, are typically not affected by TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, in one report, 15 percent of children with chronic daily headaches missed more than 10 days of school, although it is unclear whether this group had concurrent migraine, which tends to be debilitating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Sensitivity to light and noise may occur but are not as common in TTH as in migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The presence of photophobia or phonophobia may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of migraine. Abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, and changes in appetite are uncommon.</p><p>Children with headache and their parents may be overly sensitive to pain. One study evaluated 96 children (age six years), including 58 with migraine and 38 with TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Compared with matched control children, those with headache were more likely to become excited about a physical examination, cried more during blood sampling or immunization, avoided play because they were afraid of hurting themselves, and had recurrent abdominal and growing pains. More children with tension-type than migraine headaches had poor family environments, an unhappy family atmosphere, or a distant relationship between the parents. In one study, maternal depression was associated with headache in preschool children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of TTH is made when the description of the attacks is consistent with the typical features of TTH, the diagnostic criteria (see <a href=\"#H12875187\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below) are fulfilled, and the general and neurologic examinations are normal, with the possible exceptions that increased tenderness of pericranial myofascial tissues and the presence of trigger points are compatible with the diagnosis of TTH.</p><p>The proper evaluation of a child with chronic headaches requires sufficient time to obtain a detailed medical and social history. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of TTH can be limited by the inability of young children to communicate reliable information about the headaches and inciting factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In addition, there is some overlap between the features of TTH and those of migraine without aura, since episodes of migraine can present as bilateral short-lasting headache resembling TTH. In one study of 200 children with recurrent or chronic primary headache, current diagnostic criteria could not distinguish between migraine without aura and TTH in 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

There are no auras with TTH, whether visual, language, sensory, motor, or coordination. Similarly, other features typically associated with migraine headache, such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and noise, are not features of episodic TTH. However, the presence of photophobia or phonophobia (but not both) does not exclude the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is an exception for chronic TTH that allows mild nausea as long as there is no photophobia or phonophobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12875173\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A description of the headaches is obtained by interviewing the child and his or her parents. Observation of the interaction between the child and examiner or the child and parents may suggest stress factors in the home.

Some clinicians recommend use of a headache diary that is kept by the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As noted above, the history can be limited by the inability of young children to communicate reliable information about the headaches and inciting factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>School performance, home and family dynamics, psychosocial stressors, and coping skills should be assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Obtaining a family history of chronic headaches or pain syndromes may be helpful. A history should be obtained of prescription or over-the-counter medications, as these can initiate a new type of headache or exacerbate a preexisting headache disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Other potential adverse effects of neuroimaging include radiation exposure, exposure to anesthesia if sedation is required, and false reassurance from an inadequate study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, many parents are concerned that their child's headache is caused by a brain tumor and this fear may make treatment of TTH difficult. In these cases, brain imaging may be sought to relieve apprehensions.</p><p>Predictors for intracranial pathology (ie, space-occupying lesion or central nervous system infection) have been identified in small observational studies. As an example, a retrospective study of 315 children with headache and no neurologic disorder observed that the presence of a surgical lesion on neuroimaging with CT and MRI was associated with the following clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No family history of migraine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of visual symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache of less than six months duration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal neurologic examination</p><p/><p>Many clinicians prefer MRI for imaging children who have chronic headaches, because MRI has a better resolution than CT and does not expose the child to radiation. However, CT is more readily available for emergent evaluation and is useful for identifying intracranial bleeding and a variety of other structural lesions, including associated calcification that may occur with vascular malformations, tumors, chronic subdural hematomas, and congenital viral infections. In addition, contrast-enhanced CT can demonstrate brain abscess.

Because of the association of TTH-like symptoms with secondary headaches, such as those due to medication overuse or structural brain lesions, we suggest that practitioners consider the possibility of a secondary headache disorder when patients present for clinical care with presumed TTH.</p><p>Though only a small minority of children with headaches have a brain tumor, it is crucial to make the correct diagnosis in such cases. The features of brain tumor headache are generally nonspecific and vary widely with tumor location, size, and rate of growth. The headache is usually bilateral, but can be on the side of the tumor. Brain tumors may cause chronic daily headache because of increased intracranial pressure or traction on pain sensitive structures, and may also mimic TTH, migraine, or a variety of other headache types. However, headache associated with brain tumors tends to get worse progressively, and tends to be associated with occipital head pain; the neurologic examination is usually abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-tumor-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brain tumor headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic daily headache may also evolve from TTH or chronic migraine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-in-children-approach-to-evaluation-and-general-management-strategies#H661158071\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Headache in children: Approach to evaluation and general management strategies&quot;, section on 'Migraine'</a>.)</p><p>Anomalies such as Chiari I malformation can cause chronic headaches with painful muscles at the cranial-cervical junction, but are typically associated with other neurologic manifestations (eg, obstructive hydrocephalus, cranial neuropathies, abnormal eye movements, cerebellar dysfunction) that are not associated with TTH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chiari-malformations#H10173933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chiari malformations&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Distinguishing episodic TTH from migraine without aura may be difficult. Some experts argue that patients with a stable pattern of episodic, disabling headache and a normal physical examination should be considered to have migraine in the absence of contradictory evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Unlike migraine, TTH is not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, though TTH may be associated with either photophobia or phonophobia. However, some individuals may have overlapping features of both migraine and TTH. Those patients are hard to satisfactorily label with a single diagnosis, but generally should be treated as TTH sufferers. The clinical features that appear to be most predictive of migraine compared with TTH include nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and exacerbation by physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Food triggers are also more common with migraine than with TTH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of TTH encompasses a systematic approach that includes pharmacologic intervention, such as acute treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> preventative medication options, and nonpharmacological therapies, such as biobehavioral management and patient and family education regarding lifestyle modifications to develop <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintain healthy habits. Patients and families should continue to receive emotional support as indicated.</p><p>It is important that the pain of TTH be validated as real to the patient and parents. At the same time, they should be reassured that pathologic processes, such as brain tumor, have been excluded.</p><p>Sources of stress for the child should be identified and minimized to the extent possible. Successful long-term management of both episodic and chronic headache depends upon decreasing or removing the source of stress. Counseling may be indicated for the patient and family.</p><p>A headache calendar (diary) can be used to document the frequency of headaches and to monitor treatment success.</p><p>The parents should be instructed to count the number of pain pills used and to use the minimal effective dose. It is important to clarify how access to pain medication will be achieved and, depending upon age, whether the child will be permitted to self-medicate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute treatment of infrequent episodic TTH can be accomplished using simple over-the-counter analgesics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The latter are used commonly in adults and may be used to treat headache in children, although little information is available on long-term use in this population.</p><p>Studies directly comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> for pediatric headache are limited. A 2010 systematic review found only one randomized controlled trial that included children with TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The trial enrolled 154 children and adults age 12 and older (mean age 40 years) with episodic TTH and found that complete relief at three hours was significantly higher for ibuprofen than for acetaminophen or placebo (75 versus 32 versus 13 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Aspirin</a> use should be avoided in children because of its association with Reye syndrome.

In addition, children have a high placebo responder rate, which confounds interpretation of the available data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]</p><p>As with episodic headache, initial treatment with over-the-counter analgesic medication is suggested. Other drugs, particularly tricyclic antidepressants, may be helpful if simple analgesics are ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In this situation, low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amitriptyline</a> is commonly used first. Our suggested starting dose is 5 to 10 mg (or 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> at bedtime. Depending on the response, the dose may be increase every two to three weeks by 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> to a maximum dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> a day. Day time drowsiness often occurs with doses above 30 to 40 mg per day, even when the medication is given at bedtime. Other side effects include orthostatic hypotension and anticholinergic effects.</p><p>The use of antidepressant medication in children is supported by studies in adults. In a randomized, controlled trial of 203 outpatients with chronic TTH (mean 26 headache <span class=\"nowrap\">days/month),</span> patients randomly assigned to receive a tricyclic antidepressant (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amitriptyline</a> up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nortriptyline</a> up to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> experienced a significantly greater reduction in headache activity, analgesic medication use, and headache-related disability than those receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, only one-third of patients who took tricyclic antidepressants had substantial (&ge;50 percent) reductions in headache activity. A meta-analysis also concluded that antidepressants (tricyclics and serotonin blockers) are effective in preventing chronic headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is unclear.</p><p>There are few data regarding other drugs for frequent episodic or chronic pediatric TTH. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topiramate</a> are commonly used but no controlled studies are available regarding their effectiveness in children. A single uncontrolled study of nine children with episodic or chronic TTH reported that treatment with magnesium pidolate for two months was associated with headache improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Another study of 22 children with headache reported that melatonin at bedtime was associated with improvement in 4 of the 8 children with chronic TTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topiramate</a> has not been rigorously studied for the prevention of TTH in children or adults, it is a reasonable option for adolescents with frequent or chronic TTH who are refractory to or unable to tolerate analgesics and tricyclic medications (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children#H1122613199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in children&quot;, section on 'Topiramate'</a>). Side effects include anorexia, upper respiratory tract infections, weight loss, gastroenteritis, paresthesia, and somnolence.

In a study of five children, 8 to 14 years of age, with TTH, thermal biofeedback was associated with clinically significant reductions in one or more headache parameters (frequency, duration, intensity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Four of the five children were free of headache six months later. In another report, a randomized trial of biofeedback-assisted relaxation was performed in 35 children with chronic daily headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Patients assigned to biofeedback had greater improvement at 6- and 12-month follow-up (86 versus 50 percent) compared with control.</p><p>Biobehavioral techniques may be useful for managing chronic TTH, though the supporting evidence is largely indirect and based upon studies that evaluated children with migraine, unspecified primary headaches, and other types of chronic or recurrent pain; these reports suggest that psychological interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation techniques, are effective in reducing headache frequency and severity in children and adolescents with primary headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. CBT involves the use of cognitive and coping strategies to assist in replacing maladaptive thoughts and behaviors with positive thoughts and behaviors for managing chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. However, even in pediatric migraine where there is evidence for its efficacy, few children and adolescents receive treatment with CBT for reasons that include lack of awareness that such treatment exists, lack of therapists skilled in providing CBT, and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> misconceptions around having to see a therapist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tension-type-headache-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>In some cases, a psychologic evaluation may be helpful in the evaluation of children and adolescents with frequent or chronic headaches and may assist in monitoring treatment. The patient and family members should participate in the evaluation. Input from a clergyman, family counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist may be useful. The evaluation should include an assessment of the patient's personality, depression, anxiety, parental anxiety, family history of pain, global family functioning, pain rating, and relevant social factors. Structured professional interviews may be required to obtain this information.</p><p>Standardized tests can be used to evaluate psychologic function.

The headache is typically frontal, although band-like or temporal pain can occur. The pain usually is described as a continuous pressure although the intensity may vary. Light-headedness and fatigue may occur. Daily activities, such as school attendance, are typically not affected by TTH. Sensitivity to light and noise may occur but are not as common in TTH as in migraine. The presence of photophobia or phonophobia may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of migraine.
