Children with IS typically exhibit epileptic spasms along with the electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern known as hypsarrhythmia.</p><p>The major options for treatment of IS include hormonal therapy, mainly corticotropin (ACTH), and antiseizure medication, mainly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vigabatrin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vigabatrin</a>. Pyridoxine is often used as first-line therapy for IS in Japan, although there are no randomized controlled trials of this agent as treatment for IS.</p><p>Treatment of IS has been evaluated in several consensus guidelines and evidence-based reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Conclusions have been limited by the overall poor methodology of the available studies. Lack of adherence to standardized case definitions and outcome measures is one problem with many studies. Another is that inclusion of a control group is critical, as the natural history of the disease is that clinical spasms subside and EEG patterns evolve without therapy, yet many clinicians would be reluctant not to treat as there are some observational data that delayed therapy may worsen prognosis. As a result, many questions still remain regarding the mechanism, optimal drug, dose, duration of therapy, and importance of prompt initiation of treatment after the appearance of spasms.</p><p>The management and prognosis of IS are reviewed here. The etiology and pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of infantile spasms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-infantile-spasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of infantile spasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143071721\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING TREATMENT RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An expert consensus panel has defined effective treatment of IS as complete cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalography (EEG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both parents and trained observers may miss the occurrence of spasms, especially if they are subtle. Less commonly, they may &quot;over-count&quot; imitators of spasms, especially in patients in the symptomatic group. A standard EEG to evaluate interictal activity may miss the hypsarrhythmia pattern, which can be variably present in an awake child, but is detected more sensitively in sleep. As a result, video-EEG monitoring is ideally used to assess treatment response in children with IS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-infantile-spasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of infantile spasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of medical treatment of IS is hormonal therapy with corticotropin (ACTH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of action of ACTH and glucocorticoids is not known. Administration of ACTH can control spasms in patients with adrenal suppression, suggesting that the effect is independent of adrenal corticosteroid release.</p><p>Corticotropin may have direct anticonvulsant effects, perhaps via suppression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an endogenous neuropeptide that may provoke convulsions in immature brain. This theory was suggested by a report in which administration of high-dose ACTH to rats resulted in a reduction of the expression of the <em>CRH</em> gene in amygdala [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This reduction occurred in animals with and without adrenalectomy and thus was independent of endogenous cortisol production. The effect was reproduced by a peptide fragment of ACTH without corticotrophic activity and abolished by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. In preliminary investigations, ACTH fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] and CRH receptor antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] have not been effective in patients with intractable IS. However, this result may occur in part because these peptides are not absorbed or do not cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticotropin (ACTH)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143070909\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticotropin (ACTH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticotropin-injection-gel-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">corticotropin injection gel</a>) is preferred as first-line treatment of IS in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/1,4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,11</a>].</p><p>In five small randomized controlled trials of ACTH versus other therapies for IS, cessation of spasms occurred in 42 to 87 percent of infants assigned to ACTH, and time from initiation of treatment to cessation of spasms was 7 to 12 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. In most of these studies, the response to ACTH was greater for infants with cryptogenic IS than for infants with symptomatic IS. Relapse rates ranged from 15 to 33 percent.</p><p>Data from the large National Infantile Spasms Consortium prospective multicenter cohort study also support ACTH as an effective first-line treatment strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among 232 infants age two months to two years with new-onset IS, response to first therapy (defined as clinical remission and resolution of hypsarrhythmia at three months) varied by treatment: ACTH, 55 percent; oral glucocorticoids, 39 percent; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vigabatrin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vigabatrin</a>, 36 percent; nonstandard therapies, 9 percent. Etiology and developmental status were not predictive of response. Among 118 nonresponders, the overall response rate to second-line therapy was 37 percent and was higher when the first two therapies differed in mechanism of action (55 versus 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Initiation of first-line treatment within four weeks of the onset of IS was also predictive of higher response rate to second-line therapy (44 versus 24 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143071694\"><span class=\"h3\">Formulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ACTH formulation most commonly used in the United States is a natural preparation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticotropin-injection-gel-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">corticotropin injection gel</a>, HP Acthar, given intramuscularly [IM] or subcutaneously [SC]). This preparation is a mixture of peptides and derivatives and is measured in units. </p><p>A synthetic long-acting corticotropin preparation (tetracosactide depot, Synacthen Depot) is available in Canada, Europe, and elsewhere and is measured in milligrams. According to manufacturer data, patients receiving 40 units of natural <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticotropin-injection-gel-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">corticotropin injection gel</a> may be converted to 0.5 mg IM every <strong>other</strong> day of the synthetic long-acting cosyntropin depot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Data comparing the natural and synthetic forms are not available, but uncontrolled observations suggest that efficacy is similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143070723\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal dose of ACTH (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticotropin-injection-gel-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">corticotropin injection gel</a>) is not known and may differ in individual patients.</p><p>Two randomized trials reported that response to low-dose therapy (20 units per day) was comparable to higher doses and resulted in fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. In the larger of the trials, 50 patients with recently diagnosed IS were randomly assigned to receive high-dose ACTH (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day for three weeks, 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day for two weeks, 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> every other day for three weeks, 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> every other day for one week, and taper to zero over three weeks) or low-dose ACTH (20 to 30 units per day for two to six weeks, then taper to zero over one week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The groups were similar in response to treatment (cessation of spasms and disappearance of hypsarrhythmia) (50 versus 58 percent) and rate of relapse. Hypertension occurred more often in the high-dose group (31 versus 4 percent); other side effects were similar between groups. Other retrospective studies also confirm the similar efficacy and fewer adverse side effects using lower-dose synthetic ACTH therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>A strategy individualizing therapy to treatment response was evaluated in a multicenter study of 30 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Treatment was started with low-dose ACTH (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day) administered for two to three weeks. In patients who did not respond initially, the dose was increased in intervals to a maximum of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most patients with cryptogenic spasms and one-half of those with symptomatic spasms responded to low-dose ACTH given over the course of two to three weeks. Side effects were related to dose. Other centers have also reported success with a &quot;step-up&quot; dosing protocol, with even lower initial doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Our approach is to initiate ACTH 20 to 30 units per day IM (dose <strong>not</strong> adjusted for body weight). We reevaluate in two weeks and increase to 40 units per day if spasms or hypsarrhythmia persist.</p><p>An alternative approach using a high-dose regimen has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/12,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,25,26</a>]. It consists of treatment with ACTH in a dose of 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> IM twice daily (or 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> IM once daily) for two weeks. The dose is then tapered as follows: 30, 15, and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> IM each morning for three days each, then 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> IM every other morning for six days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143071115\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of ACTH persists when therapy is discontinued. However, the optimal duration of treatment is uncertain. Although some series suggest that hormonal therapy should be continued for many months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], prolonged therapy may not be necessary. As an example, in a comparison trial of low-dose ACTH and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> in 24 patients, response occurred within two weeks of initiation of therapy in 75 percent of patients who responded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Five patients who responded relapsed within 12 to 33 months with clinical seizures but not hypsarrhythmia; four of these responded to a second course of treatment. Many side effects of hormonal therapy are associated with long-term use. (See <a href=\"#H143071122\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p>The 2010 consensus statement suggests initiating a taper of ACTH after two weeks of therapy at the maximum dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Relapses are not uncommon among patients who responded to an initial treatment course. No data are available to guide therapy in these cases. Typically, a second course (four to six weeks) of the agent that was previously effective in obtaining control is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143071122\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant side effects may occur with ACTH, as they did in 37 and 85 percent of treated patients in two reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Side effects include hypertension, immune suppression and infection, electrolyte imbalance, gastrointestinal disturbances, ocular opacities, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cerebral atrophy, and growth impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/1,13,14,22,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14,22,31-33</a>]. A transient cushingoid appearance, hirsutism, irritability, and sleep disorders also are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These changes are reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring of patients on ACTH should include measurement of blood pressure (baseline and once weekly) and serum concentrations of glucose, potassium, and sodium (baseline and every other week). The patient should be observed closely and treated promptly for infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, infection related to ACTH occurred in 6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Rarely, death due to sepsis directly attributable to ACTH has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension is the most common complication. In one series, hypertension, defined as sustained blood pressure higher than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg, occurred in 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Intracranial hemorrhage has been associated with hypertension in this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. High-dose ACTH is associated with increased frequency of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Reducing the corticosteroid dose does not always result in a sustained reduction of blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte imbalance may depend upon the corticosteroid dose. Hypokalemic alkalosis occurred in as much as 12 percent of patients on high-dose ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. By contrast, no significant electrolyte abnormalities were detected by serial laboratory monitoring during low-dose, short-term hormonal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients with IS often have increased irritability during treatment and may have disturbed sleep patterns, although these may be caused in part by the underlying disease. Compared with normal infants, total sleep time and the proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are reduced in IS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thus, sleep disturbances may be caused by IS rather than hormonal therapy.</p><p>Reduced brain size may result from ACTH and corticosteroid therapy. Ventriculomegaly and increased volume of the subarachnoid space, consistent with cerebral atrophy, have been detected on computed tomography (CT) scans of patients receiving hormonal treatment for IS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/13,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,36-39</a>]. These changes may persist after termination of therapy. In a trial comparing ACTH and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, cerebral atrophy was detected by CT scan in 62 percent of patients during treatment; changes persisted in 42 percent six weeks after therapy was stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Subdural hematoma, resulting from brain shrinkage, may occur, even during administration of low-dose ACTH therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These findings are consistent with studies in animals treated with ACTH and glucocorticoids that demonstrate interference with synthesis of brain DNA, RNA, and protein, and reduction in brain size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The relationship of the changes in brain volume to long-term neurologic outcome of patients with IS is unknown.</p><p>Patients treated with high-dose and prolonged regimens of glucocorticoid therapy may be at risk for reduced bone density later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; however, there are no studies that indicate whether follow-up is needed to diagnose and treat this condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less costly, easier-to-administer hormonal therapy regimens have been suggested as potential effective alternatives to ACTH. However, most consensus and guideline groups have found the data regarding glucocorticoids to be insufficient to recommend their use as first-line treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. A 2015 consensus document from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) concluded that steroids are probably effective in the short-term control of spasms, but that the optimal preparation, dose, and duration have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Uncontrolled studies have noted that other hormonal therapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>) appear to control spasms in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/29,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,44-46</a>].

However, in a long-term follow-up study of 214 children, prognosis was not improved by larger (120 to 160 units) compared with smaller doses (20 to 40 units) of ACTH, although fewer side effects occurred in the latter.</p><p>Studies assessing the benefit of therapy on long-term outcomes are both conflicting and difficult to evaluate; most of the available studies are retrospective and lack specific treatment courses or objective criteria for response. Because of these limitations, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) systematic review of treatment for IS concluded that successful treatment of IS possibly improves the long-term prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome in adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little information is available on very-long-term outcome of children with IS. Some adults with a history of IS have normal intelligence and socioeconomic status, as illustrated by one report of 214 children born between 1960 and 1976 who were followed for 20 to 35 years or until death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. Death occurred in 31 percent at 3 months to 30 years of age. Intelligence was normal or mildly impaired in 24 percent of the survivors, and 33 percent had no seizures. Some patients with normal intelligence and socioeconomic status had symptomatic IS or focal EEG findings. All patients with a good outcome had short delays between presentation and treatment and responded to ACTH therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2504927989\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Of the available therapies, ACTH has the best established efficacy. The optimal dose and duration of treatment is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H143070909\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We typically start with ACTH 20 to 30 units per day intramuscularly (IM; dose <strong>not</strong> adjusted for body weight) and evaluate treatment response in two weeks, increasing the dose to 40 units per day if spasms or hypsarrhythmia persist. (See <a href=\"#H143070723\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use of video-electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate treatment response is ideal. Clinical observation frequently misses subtle spasms, and shorter EEGs are less sensitive for detecting hypsarrhythmia. (See <a href=\"#H143071721\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring treatment response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We typically initiate a taper of ACTH after two weeks at the maximum dose used. (See <a href=\"#H143071115\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An alternative approach uses higher-dose ACTH 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> IM twice daily for two weeks. The dose then is tapered as 30, 15, and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> each morning for three days each, then 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> every other morning for six days. (See <a href=\"#H143070723\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Side effects of ACTH are common and include hypertension, irritability, infection, reversible cerebral atrophy, and rarely death due to sepsis. Monitoring should include measurement of blood pressure (baseline and once weekly) and serum concentrations of glucose, potassium, and sodium (baseline and every other week). The patient should be observed closely and treated promptly for infections.

It appears to be particularly effective in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TS). However, its efficacy needs to be balanced against the risk of toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H869818\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H143072126\" class=\"local\">'Tuberous sclerosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Permanent retinal toxicity is a potentially severe side effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vigabatrin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vigabatrin</a>, which is available in the United States only under a restricted distribution program (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies [REMS]). Ophthalmologic evaluation and monitoring is required in patients on this agent. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A typical dosing regimen includes an initial dose of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, escalating to 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day as required for clinical response. Efficacy is assessed at two weeks after dose change. The optimal treatment duration is unknown. Patients who respond to therapy can be continued on the drug for six months. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Dose and administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative therapies that we use for children who do not respond to ACTH include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Prednisone</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally).

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Vigabatrin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The ketogenic diet may be effective in children who are refractory to ACTH and other therapies. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Ketogenic diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is insufficient evidence to recommend any other treatment for IS, including valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrazepam-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrazepam</a>, pyridoxine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zonisamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">zonisamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topiramate</a>, novel therapies, or initial combination therapy.

(See <a href=\"#H143071115\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall prognosis for children with IS is poor.
