Patients with HCM have an increased incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and are at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and embolic stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-pathophysiology-and-management-of-concurrent-atrial-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of concurrent atrial arrhythmias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment and management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the majority of patients with HCM, LVH is not progressive, and HCM is compatible with normal longevity in the vast majority with a 1 percent annual mortality rate among non-referral based cohorts. A small subset of patients, however, remains at risk for a number of adverse disease-related complications including: sudden death, usually in the absence of symptoms; progressive HF symptoms occasionally associated with systolic dysfunction; and atrial fibrillation with risk of thromboembolic stroke.</p><p>The pharmacologic treatment of patients with HCM will be reviewed here. Other issues such as the clinical manifestations and diagnosis, natural history, management of arrhythmias, and nonpharmacologic treatment of this disorder are discussed separately.

A detailed discussion of the pathophysiology of HCM is presented separately, but will be briefly reviewed here. A detailed discussion of the typical clinical manifestations of HCM is also presented separately.

SAM is caused by high velocity of systolic blood flow through the LVOT, which pulls (or drags) the mitral valve leaflet toward the ventricular septum, resulting in SAM-septal contact and direct impedance of blood flow out of the heart. SAM can also contribute to mitral regurgitation (MR); thus, therapies that relieve SAM and LVOT obstruction can also reduce MR.</p><p>LVOT obstruction is a highly visible feature of HCM and the most important mechanism responsible for limiting HF symptoms in this disease. HCM patients without LVOT obstruction can also develop symptoms often due to other factors, including diastolic dysfunction, MR, and microvascular dysfunction. Among these abnormalities, diastolic dysfunction appears to be the most important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

As a result, treatment strategies are based upon observational data and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An empiric approach is usually required, since it is not possible to predict which drug will work best for a given patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86793\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86793 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Routine prophylactic drug therapy is not usually recommended prior to the onset of symptoms, because there is no evidence that pharmacologic therapy alters the natural history of asymptomatic patients.

Possible mechanisms of benefit of these drugs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All three agents are negative inotropes, which reduce left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers slow the heart rate and prolong diastole, allowing increased ventricular filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> is used most commonly, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> can be considered in those who are intolerant of verapamil.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers may reduce anginal symptoms by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may reduce anginal symptoms by improving microvascular function and, therefore, myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176825\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Negative inotropic agents, including beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (most commonly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>, are the most widely used initial therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There are little controlled data on the efficacy of any of these therapies. Either a beta blocker or verapamil is usually tried first (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86793\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86793 \">algorithm 1</a>), with the drug initiated at a low dose that is titrated until symptoms are relieved or side effects occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If the first drug does not provide benefit, it is reasonable to switch to the other.</p><p>Our approach to the initial treatment of symptomatic patients with HCM is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have significant symptoms of heart failure (HF) and LVOT obstruction, we recommend initial monotherapy with a negative inotropic agent (beta blocker, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>). Because of the known safety profile and lower likelihood of peripheral vasodilation, we suggest using a beta blocker as the initial choice.

Alternatively, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be added to beta blocker therapy; however, this approach is frequently limited by symptomatic bradycardia.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Disopyramide'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Many experts favor beta blockers over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> in patients with evidence of LVOT obstruction (particularly in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>), due to the potential risks associated with the vasodilatory effects of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and disopyramide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/1,3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,13,14</a>]. There is no role for using three drugs (beta blockers, verapamil, and disopyramide) simultaneously. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Medications to be avoided or used with caution'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients have persistent HF symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue, etc) despite maximal therapy with negative inotropes (beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therapeutic options in such patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cautious use of diuretics &ndash; Diuretics are relatively contraindicated in most patients with HCM due to the potential reduction in preload, which may exacerbate LVOT obstruction, resulting in worsening symptoms and hypotension. However, in patients <strong>without</strong> LVOT obstruction who have refractory HF symptoms and are volume overloaded, diuretics may be used cautiously and are often effective in low doses transiently or on an as-needed basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic therapies &ndash; Nonpharmacologic therapies include surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation.

However, cautious use of diuretics may be attempted only in nonobstructed HCM patients with persistent HF and evidence of volume overload. (See <a href=\"#H176825\" class=\"local\">'Approach to medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Losartan</a>, an angiotensin receptor blocker, has also been investigated as a potential disease-modifying agent in patients with HCM. In a randomized trial of 133 patients with HCM who had minimal or no symptoms (94 percent NYHA class 1 or 2) and no resting LVOT obstruction (mean LVOT gradient 8 mmHg), in which patients were randomized to losartan 100 mg daily or placebo (in addition to standard HCM therapy), there was no significant difference in LV systolic function, left atrial volume, or exercise capacity at 12-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. While apparently safe in patients without LVOT obstruction, losartan had no impact of HCM disease-progression and should not be routinely used in the treatment of HCM. </p><p>The benefit of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with HCM and end-stage (LVEF&lt;50 percent) has not been studied; however, their benefits are well known in other patients with cardiomyopathy and reduced LVEF. As such, these medications may be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with HCM and end-stage disease associated with reduced LVEF.

Both rapid heart rates and the loss of &quot;atrial kick&quot; impair LV filling, which has an even greater clinical impact in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Thus, aggressive rate control and, if necessary, rhythm control is particularly important in these patients. The management of arrhythmias in HCM, including the role of anticoagulation, is discussed separately.

Treatment of symptomatic HCM patients is usually initiated at a low dose, and a strategy can be instituted in which the drug is titrated to higher doses as heart rate and blood pressure tolerate until clinical improvement is observed or side effects occur.</p><p>Beta blockers were among the first drugs used for the treatment of symptomatic HCM. The potential benefits of beta blockers were first described in the 1960s, and a number of subsequent, predominantly nonrandomized, studies have noted beneficial hemodynamic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/6,7,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,18-21</a>].

[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Because the patients were only mildly or moderately symptomatic at baseline, the lack of improvement in exercise capacity cannot be extrapolated to patients with more severe disease.</p><p>The majority of evidence supporting beta blockers use in HCM is derived from its benefit in blunting increases in gradient with provocation, such as with exercise. In a cohort study of 27 patients without resting LVOT obstruction but an exercise-provoked LVOT gradient of 30 mmHg or greater, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisoprolol</a> for one year resulted in significantly lower post-exercise LVOT gradients (36 mmHg versus 87 mmHg at baseline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. While the findings of a reduction in LVOT obstruction are encouraging, additional studies are needed to confirm these results and investigate whether this reduction in provocable LVOT obstruction results in improved outcomes.</p><p>Society guidelines have advocated for the use of beta blockers as first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>]. In the absence of large randomized trials, the use of beta blockers is based upon an understanding of the pathophysiology of HCM, the characteristics of these drugs, and extensive clinical experience.

Studies of pharmacologic therapy in HCM have largely been limited to symptomatic patients. In these populations, such treatment does not appear to alter the natural history of HCM, and routine pharmacologic therapy of asymptomatic patients has not been supported by major professional societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Some asymptomatic patients have clinical or morphologic features that may put them at an increased risk for the future development of heart failure (eg, substantial resting LVOT obstruction; gradient &ge;75 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. Some experts recommend offering asymptomatic patients treatment with low-dose beta blockers, based on the theoretical benefit that beta blockers will mitigate greater increases in gradient during routine daily activities. However, there is no evidence that beta blockers provide any protective benefit from developing life-threatening arrhythmias; therefore, for patients considered high-risk for sudden cardiac death based on the conventional risk factors, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy for primary prevention of sudden death should be considered, following an extended discussion with the patient regarding the potential benefits and burdens of this approach. The issue of ICD use for the prevention of sudden cardiac death is discussed in detail separately.

Vasodilators and diuretics should be used with caution or avoided in patients with significant LVOT obstruction, given the possibility of worsening LVOT obstruction and symptoms. Because of the known safety profile and lower likelihood of peripheral vasodilation, we suggest using a beta blocker as the initial choice (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Medications to be avoided or used with caution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have symptoms of HF and LVOT obstruction despite monotherapy with a beta blocker, we suggest discontinuing the beta blocker and starting a trial of monotherapy with a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Alternatively, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be added to beta blocker therapy; however, this approach is frequently limited by symptomatic bradycardia.

In most patients without obstructive CHD, the pharmacologic management of chest discomfort is similar to that of HF in patients with HCM. Beta blockers and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> are the first-line agents. In patients without LVOT obstruction, verapamil is often the most efficacious at improving chest pain.

However, revisions to guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis state that patients with HCM no longer require routine prophylaxis. Expert opinion amongst those who manage large numbers of patients with HCM continues to favor antimicrobial bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis before dental procedures, particularly for patients with LVOT obstruction.

In patients with HCM who are undergoing noncardiac surgery, close monitoring of intraoperative hemodynamics, particularly during induction, hemorrhage, and other perioperative stressors, is critical. Invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure and LV filling pressure has been advocated in higher-risk surgical procedures. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may help guide intraoperative management.
