The majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube (84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but other possible sites include cervical, interstitial (also referred to as cornual, a pregnancy located in the proximal segment of the fallopian tube that is embedded within the muscular wall of the uterus), hysterotomy scar (eg, in patient with a previous cesarean delivery), intramural, ovarian, or abdominal. In addition, in rare cases, a multiple gestation may be heterotopic (include both a uterine and extrauterine pregnancy).</p><p>Ectopic pregnancy is a potentially life-threatening condition. While surgical approaches are the gold-standard treatment, advances in early diagnosis in the 1980s facilitated the introduction of medical therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. With the routine use of early ultrasound, diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can be established early and medical treatment can be administered in many cases. The overall success rate of medical treatment in properly selected women is nearly 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In select cases of early ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy of unknown location, expectant management is an option.</p><p>Guidance regarding how to choose a treatment for ectopic pregnancy will be reviewed here.

The remaining two-thirds of women will require surgery (eg, due to suspicion of a ruptured tube, large ectopic pregnancy, inability to comply with the follow-up for MTX therapy) and some patients may prefer surgical treatment. A limited proportion of patients are eligible for expectant management. However, with early diagnosis, most patients with ectopic pregnancy may be treated medically with MTX.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785308555\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL VERSUS SURGICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For appropriately selected patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) therapy is a noninvasive option that has comparable efficacy, safety, and fertility outcomes with surgery.</p><p>The advantages of surgical treatment are less time for resolution of the ectopic pregnancy and avoidance of the need for prolonged monitoring. Surgery is required when emergency treatment is indicated or MTX therapy is contraindicated or unlikely to be successful.</p><p>For women with tubal pregnancy who are candidates for MTX therapy, we suggest MTX rather than surgical treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114571\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114571 \">algorithm 1</a>). Surgery is required for women who need emergency surgical treatment (hemodynamically unstable, suspected tubal rupture). Women may reasonably choose surgery if they need a concurrent surgical procedure or if they value a treatment that is of shorter duration and involves less follow-up and are willing to take the risks and recovery time associated with surgery.</p><p>There are two choices of surgical approach for tubal pregnancy. Salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube) and salpingostomy (incising the tube to remove the tubal gestation but leaving the remainder of the tube intact). There is a small risk of retained trophoblastic tissue and an increased risk of recurrent ectopic pregnancy with salpingostomy, but both procedures appear to result in similar subsequent fertility. Traditionally, salpingectomy has been the standard procedure, but salpingostomy is preferred because it is a conservative surgical option.

Studies have reported conflicting results regarding whether surgery or medical treatment is more cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>]. </p><p>MTX treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy appears to be as effective as laparoscopic salpingostomy, if the patient receives multiple MTX doses if necessary. A systematic review of randomized trials found that a single dose of systemic MTX (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> was significantly less successful than laparoscopic salpingostomy (four trials; 71 versus 88 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.94). However, when additional doses were given if a single dose was unsuccessful, there was comparable efficacy to salpingostomy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92-1.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There was no significant difference between systemic MTX in a fixed multiple-dose regimen and surgery (one trial; 82 versus 71 percent; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93-1.43). In one trial, health-related quality of life was significantly more severely impaired after MTX than salpingostomy (eg, more pain, less energy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The systematic review did not address complication rates, but the trials were likely underpowered to detect rare surgical complications.</p><p>The rate of tubal rupture without treatment is high. This was illustrated in a population-based study in France that reported an 18 percent rate of tubal rupture among 843 women with ectopic pregnancy; women treated with MTX were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Reported rates of rupture after MTX treatment are 7 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The rate of rupture of ectopic pregnancy certainly depends on the population studied (rural versus urban, availability of early access to the medical facility, the readily available transvaginal ultrasound and serum hCG measurement and surveillance). With early detection and close surveillance, the rate of tubal rupture is very low. The estimated death related to ectopic pregnancy is 31.9 per 100,000 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Since most of mortalities is due to intraperitoneal bleeding of ruptured ectopic pregnancy, one can assume that the rate tubal rupture is very low. Further, intra-abdominal bleeding could also be due to tubal abortion.</p><p>Treatment with MTX does not appear to compromise ovarian reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a study of women treated with in vitro fertilization, ovarian responses among women with a history of ectopic pregnancy treated with MTX or salpingectomy were comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>It appears that the fertility rates after treatment of ectopic pregnancy with salpingostomy, salpingectomy, or MTX are similar. In the systematic review of randomized trials, subsequent fertility outcomes were reported in 98 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. No significant differences were found between single-dose MTX and salpingostomy in the number of intrauterine pregnancies (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66-1.54) or in recurrent ectopic pregnancy (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.14-2.77). Ectopic pregnancy is likely associated with subfertility since extrauterine pregnancy is usually due to altered tubal function secondary to clinical or subclinical salpingitis. In a subsequent randomized trial of 446 women assigned to salpingotomy or salpingectomy, the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates after 36 months were comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The risk of another ectopic pregnancy appears to be the same for both medical and surgical therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Almost all ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube (98 percent). Tubal ectopic pregnancy may be treated with medically (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>), surgically, or with expectant management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114571\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114571 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3682907523\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with tubal pregnancy who are candidates for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) therapy, we suggest MTX rather than surgical treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H785308555\" class=\"local\">'Medical versus surgical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for MTX treatment are women with ectopic pregnancy who meet the following criteria (see <a href=\"#H4213902178\" class=\"local\">'Selection criteria'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemodynamically stable</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have no renal, hepatic, or hematologic disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Able and willing to comply with post-treatment monitoring and have access to medical care in case of a ruptured fallopian tube</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pretreatment serum hCG concentration &le;5000 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No fetal cardiac activity on transvaginal ultrasound</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors that may impact the efficacy of MTX treatment of ectopic pregnancy include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) &gt;5000 milli-international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> large ectopic size (eg, &ge;3.5 cm), and sonographic finding of peritoneal fluid.
