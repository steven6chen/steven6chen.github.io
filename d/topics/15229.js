Bisphosphonates accumulate in areas that are developing stress fractures and suppress intracortical remodeling, impairing normal healing of the stress fracture.

In retrospect, there may be cortical thickening on plain radiographs obtained prior to fracture. Thus, evaluation is recommended in patients with new onset of groin or mid-thigh pain who have been taking bisphosphonates, particularly for more than 3 to 10 years. Conventional radiography is usually the initial imaging procedure, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or bone scintigraphy if indicated (eg, evidence of periosteal thickening and cortical lucency in the region of periosteal thickening on plain radiographs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bisphosphonates should be discontinued and adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation prescribed for patients with atypical fractures or stress reaction on radiographs.

Conservative management (limited weight bearing, calcium and vitamin D, observation) may be adequate for patients with incomplete fracture and minimal pain. Reduced activity is continued until there is no edema on MRI or no increased activity on bone scan. Orthopedic intervention may be necessary to prevent complete fracture if there is no radiographic improvement after two to three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another option in some cases would be the use of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in conjunction with comprehensive orthopedic intervention and surveillance.

There are no randomized trials to definitively determine the efficacy of teriparatide in patients with atypical fractures. The results of randomized trials of teriparatide or PTH 1-84 in patients with distal radial or pelvic fractures (ie, not atypical fractures) are conflicting, with one showing benefit in fracture healing and another showing no benefit.
