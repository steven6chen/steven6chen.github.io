The management and outcome of patients with heterotaxy are discussed separately.

It is defined as an abnormal arrangement of the internal thoracic-abdominal organs across the left-right axis of the body. Patients with heterotaxy have been historically stratified into either the subsets of asplenia syndrome or polysplenia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, this classification is not useful in describing the cardiac malformations associated with heterotaxy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74995271\"><span class=\"h2\">Isomerism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with heterotaxy, the normal asymmetry of the thoracic and abdominal organs is lost, resulting in an unusual degree of symmetry of organs and veins. The term &quot;isomerism,&quot; derived from Greek (<em>iso,</em> meaning &quot;equal,&quot; and <em>meros</em>, meaning &quot;part&quot;), refers to this abnormal developmental symmetry in which morphologic structures that normally develop on one side are found on both sides of the body and is the currently accepted term used to describe hearts with isomeric atria and atrial appendages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. So, in affected patients, instead of distinct left and right sides, individuals with isomerism will have either two right sides or two left sides resulting in either two right atria or two left atria (atrial isomerism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Atrial isomerism is a major component of heterotaxy and causes significant morbidity and mortality because of discordance among the heart, systemic and pulmonary vessels, and other organs, and also among components of the heart.</p><p>Right atrial appendage isomerism, also referred to as right atrial isomerism (RAI), results in two right sides with bilateral right atria and atrial appendages and an absence of left-sided structures (eg, coronary sinus). These patients usually have pulmonary venous anomalies, such as anomalous pulmonary venous connections or small pulmonary veins. Single ventricle physiology is predominant in RAI. These patients also typically have asplenia, as the spleen is a left-side abdominal organ. (See <a href=\"#H309390928\" class=\"local\">'Right atrial isomerism'</a> below.)</p><p>Left atrial appendage isomerism, also referred to as left atrial isomerism (LAI), results in two left sides with bilateral left atria and atrial appendages. In these cases, systemic venous abnormalities, such as interruption of the inferior vena cava, are common. The cardiac anatomy is more variable in LAI than in RAI. Polysplenia also occurs more often, as left-sided organs are more frequently duplicated in patients with LAI. (See <a href=\"#H309391683\" class=\"local\">'Left atrial isomerism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74995331\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY AND ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arrangement of the viscera and atria in the first weeks of gestation results in one of three arrangements of the abdominal and thoracic organs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Situs solitus &ndash; Normal asymmetrical arrangement of abdominal and thoracic organs and vessels with unique right and left concordant structures including a right-sided liver, left-sided stomach, right-sided inferior vena cava (IVC) that flows into the right atrium (RA), and right- and left-sided atrial morphology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Situs inversus &ndash; The mirror image of situs solitus, in which there is a reversal of placement of the abdominal and thoracic structures resulting in a left-sided liver, right-sided stomach, left-sided IVC, right atria on the left side, and the left atria on the right side. With this arrangement, concordance among organs, vessels, and cardiac components is generally conserved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Situs ambiguus &ndash; Situs ambiguus is defined as abnormal arrangements of abdominal and thoracic organs that do not include situs inversus. Most cases of situs ambiguus are due to heterotaxy. In these patients, disruption of the left and right axis differentiation occurs in early development, resulting in a variety of cardiac and noncardiac anomalies. This results in different combinations of defects between patients with right versus left atrial isomerisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91233 \">table 1</a>). These patients may have significant complications because of discordance among the heart, systemic and pulmonary vessels, and other organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The heart's position in the thorax and the direction (right versus left) in which the apex points do not correlate with the isomerism of any particular side. However, a malpositioned heart should always alert the clinician to the possibility that isomerism might be present. Overall, in heterotaxy, 50 to 70 percent of the patients have levocardia, 25 to 50 percent have dextrocardia, and 5 to 10 percent have mesocardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25549988\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heart is divided into three embryonic anatomical segments:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viscera and atria, which form the atria, including the atria septa, and systemic (superior and inferior vena cava) and pulmonary venous returns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular loop, which forms the ventricles, including the ventricular septa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Truncus arteriosus, which forms the main pulmonary artery and aorta</p><p/><p>These segments are connected by two junctional cardiac segments (the atrioventricular [AV] canal and the infundibulum [also referred to as the conus arteriosus]). In normal development, the anatomic segments develop into unique right and left concordant structures (eg, morphologic RA aligned with the right ventricle [RV]) that are connected through the junctional (connecting) segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91283\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91283 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In patients with heterotaxy, the early disruption of cardiac development typically causes right or left atrial isomerism, which often results in discordance among cardiac segments. Thus, systemic and pulmonary venous returns and ventricles are not reliably aligned with the morphologically correct atrium, resulting in the clinical features of the anatomic variants of heterotaxy. Although any pattern of cardiac defects can be seen, particular combinations of anatomic lesions of various cardiac segments are commonly observed, which differentiate right and left isomerism, as discussed in the following sections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91233 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H309390928\"><span class=\"h3\">Right atrial isomerism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right atrial isomerism (RAI) results in two right sides with bilateral right atria and atrial appendages, and an absence of left-sided structures, such as the coronary sinus. In general, patients with RAI have a consistent pattern of cardiac lesions that include anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, which often results in some degree of pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, and single ventricle physiology. The combination of the following anatomic features results in significant right-to-left shunting and cyanosis. (See <a href=\"#H10127413\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial anatomy &ndash; In cases of RAI, there are two broad-based appendages with a terminal crest (crista terminalis). In addition, the atrial septum is typically absent and there are large primum and secundum defects separated by a thin muscular strand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic and pulmonary venous returns &ndash; The coronary sinus (left-sided structure) is often absent. In addition, bilateral superior venae cavae (SVCs) occur in 50 to 80 percent of the patients, but it is rare to encounter interruption of the IVC in RAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. In contrast, interruption of the IVC is a characteristic finding of left atrial isomerism (LAI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with RAI, pulmonary venous return typically drains to extracardiac structures due to the absence of the left atria, mainly to the SVC and the portal system. This occurs in 60 to 87 percent of patients with RAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7,12,13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,12,13,16,17</a>]. Approximately half of these anomalous pulmonary veins become obstructed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV junction and ventricles &ndash; The AV valve is almost always a complete AV canal type and there are rarely two separate AV rings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91234\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91234 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Complete AV canal defect generally occurs in RAI but can also be seen less frequently in cases of LAI. The AV valve commonly tends to be thickened, with rudimentary leaflets, deformed papillary muscles, and abnormal chordal attachments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The inlet septum is hypoplastic with a large inlet ventricular septal defect (VSD). Patients with RAI usually have single RV morphology with a hypoplastic left ventricle (LV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8,12,16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,12,16,23</a>]. Single left and biventricular morphologies are also seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Normal D-looping of the ventricles, in which the morphologic RV is on the right side of the patient and the morphologic LV is on the left side of the patient, occurs in 62 to 78 percent of patients with RAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The remaining patients have L-looping of the ventricles with the RV on the left side and vice versa. As with normal hearts, patients with heterotaxy have a subpulmonary conus and aortomitral continuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Great arteries and semilunar valves &ndash; Approximately 85 percent of patients with RAI have significant pulmonary artery stenosis or atresia. In neonates with either critical pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia, survival is dependent on pulmonary blood flow through a patent ductus arteriosus.

In systematic review including 36 observational studies of patients with heterotaxy, those with RAI were found to be more likely to have atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, junctional tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia; and those with LAI were more likely to have atrioventricular block, intraventricular conduction delay, sick sinus syndrome, and atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The anatomy and function of the AV node and the bundle of His depend on the ventricular topology and the AV connection. In D-looped ventricles, the AV node is in its usual position unless there is an AV septal defect, in which case the AV node will be displaced posteroinferiorly. In L-looped ventricles, the AV node position will be either anterior or both anterior and posterior, and connected by a sling of tissue, resulting in a tenuous connection prone to the development of AV block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32,33</a>].

When attempting to map and ablate arrhythmias in these patients, special challenges arise, such as problematic access to the atria.

Cilia at the embryonic node move in a clockwise rotary motion that causes a leftward nodal flow: the first physical sign of left-right asymmetry.

The transmission of these asymmetric signals to the lateral plate mesoderm provokes an asymmetrical increased influx of calcium ion in the sensory cilia cells through the gene product of <em>PKD2</em>. This calcium influx is linked to the activation of the <em>NODAL</em> gene in the left-side perinodal cells of a midline structure (Hensen nodes) at the distal tip of the primitive streak and leads to expression of other gene products including PITX2, LEFTY1, and LEFTY2.

In RAI, the aorta and IVC run adjacent and parallel to each other (they are &quot;juxtaposed&quot;), with the aorta posterior to either the right or the left of the spine. In LAI, the aorta is often midline. No normal IVC is seen, but azygos continuation of the IVC courses posterior to the aorta, either to the left or right of the spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91293\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91293 \">image 4</a>).

In rare cases, when data from echocardiography or CMRI are insufficient, cardiac catheterization may be performed. As an example, in patients with right atrial isomerism (RAI) and pulmonary atresia, angiocardiography may be needed to assess pulmonary arterial blood supply and pulmonary artery anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>].

Cardiac malformations are a major component of heterotaxy syndrome and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H74995201\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial isomerism is rare, occurring in approximately 1 per 10,000 to 40,000 live births. (See <a href=\"#H309396812\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right atrial appendage isomerism, also referred to as right atrial isomerism (RAI), results in two right sides with bilateral right atria and atrial appendages and an absence of left-sided structures (eg, coronary sinus). These patients usually have pulmonary venous anomalies, such as anomalous pulmonary venous connections or small pulmonary veins. Single ventricle physiology is predominant in RAI as there are often atrioventricular canal defects. These patients also typically have asplenia, as the spleen is a left side abdominal organ. (See <a href=\"#H309390928\" class=\"local\">'Right atrial isomerism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left atrial appendage isomerism, also referred to as left atrial isomerism (LAI), results in two left sides with bilateral left atria and atrial appendages. In these cases, systemic venous abnormalities, such as interruption of the inferior vena cava, are common. The cardiac anatomy is more variable in LAI than in RAI. Polysplenia occurs more often, as left-sided organs are more frequently duplicated in patients with LAI. Patients with LAI are more likely to have arrhythmias because of the absence of a sinus node, which is located in the right atrium, and complete heart block. (See <a href=\"#H309391683\" class=\"local\">'Left atrial isomerism'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10127383\" class=\"local\">'Conduction tissues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with heterotaxy display right- or left-sidedness of other thoracic and abdominal organs, which may be discordant from atrial isomerism.

Postnatal presentation varies and is based on the wide range of anatomic lesions that lead to a spectrum of clinical presentations that extend from the asymptomatic newborn to the gravely ill cyanotic neonate. In general, patients with RAI most often present during the neonatal period with cyanosis and respiratory distress, whereas presentation of LAI is more varied and includes asymptomatic patients. Other noncardiac findings include overwhelming sepsis (due to asplenia or hyposplenia), jaundice (due to biliary atresia), and bilious vomiting (due to malrotation of the gut).
