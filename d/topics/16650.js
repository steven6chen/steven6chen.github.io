The Heller myotomy with a fundoplication is the optimal surgical treatment of achalasia, with effective symptom control in 90 to 97 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The muscle fibers of the lower esophageal sphincter are incised without disrupting the mucosal lining of the esophagus and can be performed as a laparoscopic or open procedure. With the advancement of laparoscopic surgery, the open technique is rarely used. </p><p>Alternatively, esophageal and gastric myotomy can be accomplished endoscopically with the per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) procedure at select centers as an alternative to Heller myotomy.

The preoperative evaluation by the surgeon includes a history of patient symptoms as well as a review of previous studies and the results of medical therapies to alleviate symptoms.

While some controversy exists as to whether endoscopic or surgical therapy should be initiated first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], most specialists agree that it is no longer necessary or even preferred that patients first undergo a trial of medical therapy or dilatation.</p><p>Pneumatic dilatation is used in centers with significant experience with its use and for patients who prefer to avoid surgery, have undergone multiple prior abdominal operations, or would be unable to tolerate the pneumoperitoneum required to perform the procedure laparoscopically (eg, restrictive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure). However, a network meta-analysis that included 16 studies and 590 patients found that patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy had superior short- and long-term efficacy compared with patients undergoing endoscopic balloon dilatation (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.19 at 12 months, and OR 29.8, 95% CI 34.0-224.7 at 60 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37210839\"><span class=\"h1\">REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of achalasia is based upon the clinical history, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow, and esophageal manometry. Esophageal manometry, endoscopy, and a barium swallow study are essential to confirming the diagnosis of achalasia, and the studies should be personally reviewed by the surgeon before proceeding with an operation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2177558\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The key diagnostic studies that a surgeon must review or perform to evaluate a patient for the operation are reviewed below. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manometry &ndash; Manometry is the measurement of muscular function of the esophagus in three zones: lower esophageal sphincter (LES), esophageal body, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES). High-resolution manometry (HRM) provides for a more accurate characterization of esophageal function compared with standard manometry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67060\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67060 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59926\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59926 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. HRM permits continuous recording of motor activity along the entire length of the esophagus and yields a more complete and detailed picture of esophageal motility. Manometry systems include a catheter with multiple pressure sensor channels, pressure transducers, and a recording device with a computer for analysis. The technique and the interpretation of the results are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal motility testing&quot;, section on 'Esophagus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Manometry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1015728645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'High-resolution manometry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H386844726\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Esophageal manometry'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy &ndash; Most patients undergo endoscopy to establish a diagnosis well in advance of consideration for surgery. It is important that the surgeon review the results to exclude other etiologies of the symptoms. It is not necessary to routinely repeat the endoscopy before every operative procedure, but the surgeon must have a low threshold to repeat endoscopy if concomitant or alternative upper gastrointestinal disease remains a consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2419126592\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Upper endoscopy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic imaging &ndash; The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow is the preferred initial study to define the esophageal anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53672\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53672 \">image 1</a>). This study will show the extent of esophageal dilation, shape, and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) obstruction. Absence of obstruction at the GEJ, which is characterized by a column of barium with air-fluid levels, should make one question the diagnosis. Routine computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen are not necessary, but if pseudoachalasia is suspected based on the clinical history, a CT scan or endoscopic ultrasound should be performed to ensure accuracy of diagnosis. A sigmoid esophagus is a complication of long-standing achalasia. The surgical approach to a sigmoid esophagus may be to limit the procedure to myotomy without fundoplication or an esophagectomy for patients with prior attempts at myotomy or mega-esophagus. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3226516\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL MYOTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical myotomy, in which the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is weakened by incising the muscle fibers, is the primary alternative to pneumatic dilatation for achalasia. The advantages of surgical myotomy are high initial success rates and, compared with pneumatic dilation, lower rates of symptom recurrence. The main disadvantages of surgery are the high initial cost, the protracted recovery period, and the frequent development of gastroesophageal reflux disease postoperatively, especially if a fundoplication is not part of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, the primary goal of the operative treatment is to relieve the functional obstruction of the LES while preventing reflux.</p><p>Surgical myotomy was first described in 1913 by Ernest Heller, who performed both anterior and posterior incisions at the gastroesophageal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. His technique was modified to include only the anterior myotomy. The modified Heller myotomy is the most common operative procedure used to treat achalasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The operation can be performed using an open or a minimally invasive technique, and the esophagus can be approached through the abdomen or thorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/7,12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12-18</a>]. With advances in minimally invasive surgery in the early 1990s, the thoracoscopic approach and later the laparoscopic approach became popular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/14-17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17,19</a>]. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. The main disadvantages of a thoracoscopic approach compared with a laparoscopic esophageal myotomy include limited exposure of the distal LES and stomach and the technical challenges of performing a fundoplication. With regard to clinical outcomes, the thoracoscopic approach is associated with a higher rate of residual or recurrent dysphagia (because of the shorter gastric myotomy), gastroesophageal reflux, more postoperative pain, and a longer hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Outcomes for the laparoscopic and open techniques are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia#H1988524\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of achalasia&quot;, section on 'Surgical myotomy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3226935\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is a description of the key technical elements of performing a laparoscopic esophageal myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. General issues related to laparoscopic abdominal surgery are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3227116\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can be placed in a supine, split leg, or lithotomy position with padding, such as on a surgical bean bag. We prefer the split leg position for optimal ergonomics (surgeon stands between the legs) and access to the hiatus. The patient is positioned in a steep reverse Trendelenburg position, which allows the stomach and other organs to fall away from the esophageal hiatus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3227126\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal access and port placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal access is obtained at the left upper quadrant just inferior to the costal margin by inserting a Veress needle followed by placement of an optical trocar after establishing pneumoperitoneum according to standard laparoscopic techniques. Four operative ports (two for the surgeon, one for the assistant, and one for the scope) are then placed under direct vision, and liver retraction is then achieved by any number of such devices on the market via an additional port site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68596 \">figure 2</a>). Other port placements can also be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891738\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Foregut surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3227153\"><span class=\"h3\">Mobilization of the gastric fundus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the surgeon's preference, the initial dissection can begin on the right or left side of the esophageal hiatus. The steps to mobilize the gastric fundus include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dividing the left phrenogastric ligaments by dividing the short gastric arteries, starting at the inferior pole of the spleen to the exposed left crus of the diaphragm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incising the gastrohepatic ligament in an avascular plane</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preserving the nerve of Latarjet and avoiding injury to an accessory or replaced hepatic artery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dividing the right anterior phrenoesophageal ligament and the peritoneum overlying the anterior abdominal esophagus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preserving the anterior vagus nerve, which lies immediately posterior to the right anterior phrenoesophageal ligament</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At this point, if a <strong>posterior</strong> partial (Toupet) fundoplication is performed, a posterior esophageal window is created. In creating this window, the posterior vagus nerve is identified and protected. If an <strong>anterior</strong> fundoplication (Dor) technique is used, a posterior esophageal window is unnecessary unless a hiatal hernia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> and a relatively short esophagus is encountered and there is a need for further mobilization to allow more intra-abdominal length in order to construct a proper fundoplication. (See <a href=\"#H3227471\" class=\"local\">'Fundoplication'</a> below and <a href=\"#H37208917\" class=\"local\">'Addition of a fundoplication'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3227250\"><span class=\"h3\">Mobilization of the mediastinal esophagus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distal portion of the mediastinal esophagus is mobilized to achieve sufficient length to perform a myotomy incision that divides the entire length of the LES and permits a tension-free fundoplication. A Penrose drain may be placed around the gastroesophageal junction to facilitate retraction of the esophagus but is not essential, especially if an anterior fundoplication is to be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3227260\"><span class=\"h3\">Myotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is critical when performing the myotomy that visualization and exposure are adequate to prevent inadvertent mucosal injuries. The cardioesophageal fat pad and the anterior vagus nerve <strong>must</strong> be cleared from the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction. A continuous myotomy is performed for 6 cm on the esophagus and 3 cm onto the stomach. </p><p>The following principles are important when performing the myotomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A suitable and stable platform is useful. Our preference is a lighted bougie dilator (50 Fr), which illuminates the esophagus and stretches the muscle fibers around the gastroesophageal junction, facilitating their division. An endoscope may be used instead of the lighted bougie dilator. The anterior surface of the esophagus is completely exposed, and slight tension is created by retracting caudally with a Babcock retractor or similar instrument.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incision may be started on either the stomach or the esophagus. We prefer starting on the stomach; while this is a more difficult submucosal plane to identify, we find it easier to proceed in a cephalad than caudal direction. </p><p/><p>The use of electrocautery should be <strong>avoided</strong> unless critical when creating the myotomy. If bleeding is encountered, it should be controlled with pressure and patience since thermal injury can lead to an unrecognized or delayed perforation of the esophagus. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The myotomy is performed by individually dividing the esophageal and gastric muscle fibers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The longitudinal muscles are divided first, which exposes the underlying circular muscles. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Division of the circular layer reveals a bulging mucosal plane that should appear smooth and white (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50030 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most critical and challenging factor is to create a 3-cm myotomy caudal to the gastroesophageal junction, where the tissue plane becomes less readily identifiable. An intervening sling of muscle fibers may blur the dissection, and the stomach mucosa is thinner and more prone to perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69389 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The portion of the myotomy on the esophagus should be approximately 6 cm in length. Thus, the total length of the entire myotomy is 9 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic inspection of the mucosa and the myotomy is performed prior to proceeding to the next steps to identify and repair any mucosal perforations.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3227471\"><span class=\"h3\">Fundoplication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a fundoplication procedure is performed, it is typically a partial (eg, Toupet or Dor) and not a circumferential (Nissen) wrap (see <a href=\"#H37208917\" class=\"local\">'Addition of a fundoplication'</a> below). A Toupet fundoplication is a 270&deg; posterior wrap of the fundus around the esophagus, while the Dor fundoplication is a 180&deg; anterior wrap.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a Toupet (posterior) fundoplication is being performed, a retroesophageal window is established along the lines of dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62809\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62809 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72012\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72012 \">picture 3</a>). The following is a brief description of the technique:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The fundus is mobilized by dividing the short gastric vessels and all fundal attachments starting approximately at the inferior pole of the spleen, approximately 10 to 15 cm inferior to the angle of His. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The retroesophageal window is developed by further dissection along the base of the left crus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following mobilization of the mediastinal esophagus, the gastroesophageal hiatus is closed posteriorly with interrupted sutures if a large defect is present, but our preference is to leave laxity of the hiatus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The posterior aspect of the gastric fundus is passed through the retroesophageal window and secured to the right edge of the myotomy and right crus of the diaphragm with a coronal suture. Another interrupted suture is placed to secure the posterior fundus to the base of the right crus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The leading posterior edge of the fundus is secured to the right edge of the myotomy with interrupted sutures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any redundancy of the fundus is removed from behind the esophagus, and the proximal, anterior aspect of the fundus is secured to the left side in a similar fashion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Dor (anterior) fundoplication may be particularly useful to buttress the repair of an esophageal perforation that may occur. The greater curve of the fundus is grasped and placed anteriorly to the right side of the gastroesophageal hiatus. The following is a brief description of the technique:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An inner row of interrupted sutures are used to secure the medial aspect of the fundus to the left side of the myotomy, which begins to recreate the angle of His. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The anterior fundus is folded over the esophagus, and a coronal suture to the right crus and right side of the esophagus is performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A second row of interrupted sutures is placed to fix the leading edge to the right side of the myotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52028\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52028 \">picture 4</a>). A final suture from the apex of the gastroesophageal hiatus to the fundus completes the fundoplication. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3227098\"><span class=\"h2\">Open technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no differences in surgical technique or principles when performing a myotomy with or without a fundoplication between a laparoscopic or open (laparotomy or thoracotomy) approach except for a few technical variations that are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H18856620\" class=\"local\">'Operative considerations'</a> below.)</p><p>Although in theory an open approach might be more appropriate for patients with severe pulmonary disease who will not tolerate pneumoperitoneum, such a patient most likely would not be considered a surgical candidate at all. Another indication for an open approach might be less inexperience with advanced laparoscopy; however, given that this disease is rare, and almost always can be managed electively, there is ample time for the patient to be referred to a center with experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3227463\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative technical risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major intraoperative risks include an unrecognized perforation of the esophageal or gastric mucosa, division or injury to the anterior vagus nerve, and splenic injury. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal or gastric perforation &ndash; The risk of an esophageal or gastric perforation during surgical myotomy ranges from 10 to 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. Mucosal perforations are repaired with fine 4-0 and 5-0 absorbable monofilament suture. An advantage of the anterior (Dor) fundoplication is that it will buttress the repair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Division of vagus nerve &ndash; Using careful dissection and attention to detail, injury to the vagus nerves is rare. The <strong>anterior</strong> vagus nerve is at risk of injury during several technical steps of the operation, including the initial dissection of the esophagus, mobilizing the gastroesophageal fat pad, performing the myotomy, and performing the fundoplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The <strong>posterior</strong> vagus nerve is less likely to be injured. If an injury to only the anterior or posterior vagus nerve occurs, it is not repaired, as postvagotomy diarrhea, bloating, early satiety, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dumping syndrome rarely occur with a unilateral vagotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The standard esophageal myotomy includes a 1.5- to 2.0-cm extension of the incision onto the cardia of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. A 3-cm extension of the esophageal myotomy incision onto the stomach provides long-term durable dysphagia relief due to disruption of the gastric sling, which consists of short transverse muscle fibers on the lesser curve of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The importance of the gastric sling fibers in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) mechanism was recognized when transitioning from the thoracoscopic to laparoscopic approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69389 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The following studies illustrate the outcomes of performing a standard or an extended myotomy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case series from a prospective database found that symptoms following the laparoscopic Heller myotomy were improved with an extended gastric myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients treated with a 3-cm extended gastric myotomy (n = 58) and a Toupet fundoplication had a significantly lower LES pressure (9.5 versus 15.8 mmHg), less frequent dysphagia (1.2 versus 2.1 percent), less severe dysphagia on visual analog scale (VAS) pain score (3.2 versus 5.3), and fewer recurrences requiring dilatation (2 versus 9 patients) compared with patients treated with a standard 1.5-cm gastric myotomy and a Dor fundoplication (n = 52). Patients treated with the extended gastric myotomy had similar rates of heartburn (1.3 versus 1.7 percent), regurgitation (0.3 versus 0.8 percent), chest pain (0.3 versus 0.6 percent), and proximal (1.7 versus 2.3 percent) and distal (6.0 versus 5.9 percent) esophageal acid exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of 113 patients undergoing a laparoscopic Heller myotomy reported good or excellent results in 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Ten patients (8.7 percent) were considered surgical failures, including two who reported no relief of symptoms. The reasons for recurrence of or persistent symptoms included an incomplete myotomy, sclerosis of the myotomy, and a sigmoid megaesophagus. Patients who were symptomatic following surgery had a significantly larger esophageal diameter identified on a postoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow (25.5 versus 20 mm) and a significantly longer intact LES overall (42.5 versus 37.5 mm), longer intact length of the gastric component of the LES (32 verus 27 mm), and higher amplitude of contraction above the LES (32 versus 18 mmHg).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37208917\"><span class=\"h2\">Addition of a fundoplication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for performing an antireflux fundoplication is to reduce the risk of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux that may result from obliterating the LES mechanism. The indications for addition of a fundoplication vary, in part, with the approach to the myotomy. A fundoplication is included in most patients in whom a laparoscopic myotomy is performed. A randomized trial of 43 patients undergoing a myotomy for achalasia found that patients treated with the addition of an anterior (Dor) fundoplication had significantly fewer gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (9 versus 48 percent) and a lower acid exposure time to the distal esophagus compared with patients treated with a myotomy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There was no difference in the frequency of dysphagia.</p><p>Both anterior (Dor) and posterior (Toupet) partial fundoplication techniques are used, and currently there is no consensus on which procedure is superior:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Dor procedure avoids mobilization of the stomach during the initial dissection and is technically easier to perform. In addition, it is a useful technique to buttress the repair of an inadvertent esophageal perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Toupet fundoplication splays the edges of the myotomy, which may decrease fibrosis at the incision site and reduce recurrence of dysphagia.</p><p/><p>Unfortunately, a randomized trial comparing the Dor (n = 36) and Toupet (n = 24) fundoplication techniques in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy was inconclusive due to small sample size and incomplete follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. No differences in esophageal symptoms were found between the two groups at 6 to 12 months. The Dor group had a higher percentage of patients with abnormal 24-hour pH results compared with the Toupet group, but the difference was not significant (42 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A circumferential complete fundoplication (Nissen) is usually not performed to avoid excessive constriction at the gastroesophageal junction. Our preference is to perform a Toupet partial fundoplication as we believe it reduces the risk of recurrent dysphagia by splaying open the edges of the myotomy, thus preventing scarring. In addition, it is a better antireflux procedure. We only perform a Dor fundoplication to provide coverage of the primary repair when there is an esophageal perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. &#160;</p><p>While a fundoplication is routinely performed with a laparoscopic myotomy, there are several instances when a fundoplication is not performed.

Although achalasia is rarely seen in obese patients, we believe that the optimal procedure for these patients is a laparoscopic Heller myotomy with a concomitant Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which we have performed with success in a small series of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37208924\"><span class=\"h2\">Sigmoid megaesophagus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sigmoid megaesophagus is an enlarged and atonic esophagus that results from long-standing increased LES pressure. Traditionally, a standard Heller myotomy was not performed on patients with a sigmoid megaesophagus, as the degree of esophageal dilation and relief of symptoms were not thought to improve with myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Hence, patients with a sigmoid esophagus were typically treated with an esophagectomy prior to the laparoscopic era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The results of an esophageal myotomy with a fundoplication for patients with a sigmoid megaesophagus are illustrated in the following retrospective studies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of 113 consecutive patients with achalasia who were treated with a laparoscopic Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

However, one should have a low threshold for obtaining a barium swallow if a patient develops symptoms and signs suggestive of an esophageal or gastric perforation (eg, chest pain, epigastric pain, fever, tachycardia, subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> otherwise unexplained leukocytosis). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear liquids are typically started the night of the procedure following laparoscopic surgery, or when bowel function returns following an open procedure.

Following laparoscopic Heller myotomy, the morbidity rate ranges between 1 and 10 percent and the mortality rate is &lt;0.1 percent in the 30-day perioperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/4,29,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,29,45-47</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37208954\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common early postoperative complication is gastric or esophageal perforation, which occurs in 1 to 7 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/4,29,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,29,45-47</a>]. Late perforations usually result from either direct mucosal injury that is not recognized during surgery, or inadvertent thermal injury. Perforations usually result in diffuse peritonitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediastinitis and may be life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>If a perforation is suspected, a water-soluble contrast radiograph should be obtained.

It occurs in approximately 3 to 10 percent of patients undergoing a Heller myotomy, with the onset of symptoms six months or later after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/4,29,31,46,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,29,31,46,49</a>]. The most common cause is incomplete myotomy. This can occur with incomplete division of the circular fibers on the esophagus or failure to divide the collar-sling fibers on the stomach at least 3 cm below the gastroesophageal junction. This is more common in patients that were managed with a thoracoscopic approach to myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In some cases, the incision was suboptimal, even with the laparoscopic approach; as a result, a repeat procedure may be warranted to extend the incision further into the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Other potential reasons for recurrent dysphagia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herniated fundoplication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peri-hiatal scarring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peptic stricture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructing tumors</p><p/><p>The approach to the patient with recurrent dysphagia is to identify the cause and to rule out significant pathology, such as a malignancy, stricture, or hernia.

The rate of GER for patients undergoing myotomy alone is much higher. This was demonstrated in a prospective randomized trial of 43 patients with achalasia in which patients undergoing a Heller myotomy with a Dor fundoplication had a significantly lower rate of pathologic GER at six months after surgery compared with patients undergoing a Heller myotomy without a fundoplication (9 versus 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Patients who develop GER should have pH monitoring performed three to six months after myotomy and repeated with any change in symptoms that could suggest GER, especially heartburn and regurgitation. Patients with abnormal esophageal acid exposure are treated medically. Incomplete myotomy with stasis in the distal esophagus can mimic GER.

A pneumothorax can be caused from inadvertent injury to the pleura during mobilization of the mediastinal esophagus.
