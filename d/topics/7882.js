Maternal or fetal disorders may have placental sequelae since the mother and fetus interface at this site. Conversely, primary placental abnormalities can affect both maternal and fetal health. Thus, examination of the placenta may yield information on the impact of maternal disorders on the fetus or the cause of preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, or neurodevelopmental impairment. Placental examination is an essential component of the autopsy in cases of fetal or neonatal death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-stillbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of stillbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Placental examination also aids in a number of difficult situations, such as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Legal issues regarding the presence of acute versus chronic perinatal stresses and insults, and the timing of these insults</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of the specific etiologies of adverse pregnancy outcomes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of zygosity in multiple gestations, as well as pathologies unique to these pregnancies </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of potentially recurrent disorders, potentially leading to changes in management and improved outcome of subsequent pregnancies</p><p/><p>The gross examination of the placenta is discussed here. Histopathology is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND SCOPE OF EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a general consensus that all placentas should be examined grossly, either by the delivering clinician or a pathologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Basic examination</strong> &ndash; At a minimum, the clinician at delivery should note some basic characteristics of the placenta including the number of umbilical cord vessels and if there are any gross abnormalities such as discoloration, multiple lobes, or focal lesions. It is easier for the clinicians to measure the length of the umbilical cord since the portion of the cord attached to the infant is often discarded and therefore not available to the pathologist (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Length'</a> below). The pathologist usually measures placental weight since the placenta is weighed without the cord and membranes. All of this information should be recorded in the medical record (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52233 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Weight'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Full examination</strong> &ndash; A full pathologic examination should be obtained when indicated. The delivering physician is usually responsible for determining when further examination by a pathologist is necessary, and some institutions have guidelines for their staff. A list of potential indications for histopathological examination is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71399 \">table 2</a>); the list is not all-inclusive and should be guided by clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The author believes histological examination of the placenta is indicated in the absence of a normal delivery (vaginal or cesarean) of a healthy term infant from an uncomplicated pregnancy. The institutional cost of pathologic evaluation of the placenta is minimal. Pathology assistants and technicians can be trained to perform placental gross examination. Most placentas have just a few and quite characteristic lesions that are easily recognized without special studies or procedures. Those that fall out of this realm should be referred to a pathologist for evaluation. The reimbursement for pathologic examination is usually at a level 5 (88307) and is typically not contested by any of the major insurers.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HANDLING AND STORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author believes that the safest procedure for placental handling and storage is to have all placentas sent to the pathology department. The pathologist can then triage them based on the provided or available clinical history. A suggested list of indications for placental pathologic examination are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71399 \">table 2</a>). Those with indications for full pathologic examination are accessioned and examined that day. All others are kept refrigerated for a specified period of time (the Massachusetts General Hospital keeps them for at least seven days). During this refrigerated storage time, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission list is checked daily for infants transferred from the regular nursery and the maternal readmission list is checked. After seven days, if the infant has not been admitted to the NICU and the mother has not been readmitted, the placenta can be safely discarded. This practice will help identify those infants with onset of complications after the immediate delivery period and those placentas which should be examined to evaluate maternal post-delivery complications (as an example, postpartum hemorrhage or sepsis).</p><p>Factors related to placental handling and storage include:</p><p>&#9679;<strong>Documentation</strong> &ndash; Information regarding the gestational age and pregnancy history should be provided by the delivering clinician, typically on a pathology requisition sheet. As discussed above, the clinician should document any gross abnormalities that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> identified, the length of the umbilical cord (sum of the lengths attached to the placenta and the newborn), and the number of vessels in the cord. The placentas of multiple gestations should be labeled to correctly pair each infant with its umbilical <span class=\"nowrap\">cord/placenta</span> (usually by cord clamps &ndash; one clamp for the firstborn, two for the second, etc). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Abnormalities, such as true knots, should not be disturbed by the clinician so the gross abnormality can be viewed by a pathologist. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Refrigeration</strong> &ndash; Fresh placentas should be refrigerated (not frozen) at 4 degrees Celsius and may be stored this way for three to seven days. A fresh placenta is preferable to a fixed specimen for appreciating placental surface changes, making membrane rolls, and palpating for solid lesions. Cultures, cytogenetic studies, and injection of twin placentas to detect anastomoses can only be performed on fresh tissue. Fixed placentas alter the placental weight and color but improve the identification of some parenchymal lesions, such as perivillous fibrin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cultures</strong> &ndash; Bacterial cultures are rarely needed, but can be performed with reliable results if necessary. In cases of live births or stillbirths in which an autopsy examination has been permitted, culturing the infant, fetal blood, or lung is best. For placental microbiologic cultures, the author believes the best procedure is to peel the amnion off the chorion for a significant amount of the fetal surface, and then swab the exposed (and untouched) surface with a sterile swab several times before using the swab for culture inoculation. Alternatively, once the amnion has been peeled, a small portion of chorion can be snipped off with sterile scissors and sent to the microbiology laboratory for culture. The author has performed this technique many times when indicated, such as in cases in which the fetus was stillborn and no autopsy permission was obtained, and has had good results. This technique is especially useful in detecting group B streptococcus, which can cause lethal fetal sepsis in the setting of intact membranes and mild chorioamnionitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic studies</strong> &ndash; The best placental source of tissue for genetic studies is the umbilical cord, as it is free of maternal &quot;contaminant.&quot; A small portion of chorionic plate can also be used, with minimal maternal contamination. Microarray is more likely to be successful than conventional G-banded karyotype for genetic studies after a fetal demise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fixation</strong> &ndash; After performing the above examinations, the placenta can be placed in fixative (eg, formalin) if necessary; however, it is prudent to refrigerate a small sample of placenta in normal saline in case any special studies are needed after histologic examination has been performed or clinical consultation obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">UMBILICAL CORD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical cord is normally composed of two umbilical arteries and an umbilical vein supported by loose gelatinous tissue called Wharton's Jelly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">General appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical cord should have a smooth, white, opaque, shiny appearance with spiraling, on average two complete coils in 10 cm of cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69238\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69238 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Coiling'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Color </strong>&ndash; Yellow coloring suggests infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57888\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57888 \">picture 3</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">green/yellow</span> coloring suggests meconium staining, brown coloring suggests hemosiderin staining. Yellow-green discoloration may also be umbilical vasculitis, which may be associated with perinatal sepsis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic compromise. A <span class=\"nowrap\">brown/red</span> discolored umbilical cord is consistent with fetal demise of at least six hours duration and is likely due to red blood cell lysis and hematoidin &#160; Longer retentions of fetal demise result in thea clay grey discoloration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Umbilical cord'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nodules</strong> &ndash; Nodules on the cord suggest abscesses and may be a sign of candidal infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Edema</strong> &ndash; Mild edema of the umbilical cord is common and of no clinical significance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74326\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74326 \">picture 4</a>). Massive edema (resulting in regional or diffuse cord diameters of greater than 3 cm) can cause vascular compromise and is often associated with acute changes in the fetal heart rate pattern. Some pathologists have termed areas of massive cord edema &quot;angiomyxoma&quot; due to the histologic appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Strictures</strong> &ndash; A stricture may be artifactual or the result of torsion or amniotic bands. Strictures can be important findings, as they have been implicated in the etiology of fetal demise or compromise. They should be carefully described and sampled on both sides of the stricture and through the stricture. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Coiling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical cord has a characteristic twist or coil. Twisting is usually to the left (like a barber pole), but the direction of twist (left versus right) is not an important factor in pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The average number of coils is 2 per 10 cm, or a coiling index of 0.2 (number of coils divided by length of cord examined). Coiling of the umbilical cord is thought to protect it from compression, kinking, stretch, and torsion, thus preventing disruption of the blood supply to the fetus. Coiling may also facilitate umbilical venous blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The genesis of cord twist is unclear, but likely reflects fetal movement or differences in the growth rates of the fetal vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>The pattern of cord coiling may be important and should be noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F93966\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93966 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. The segmented and linked patterns may be more highly associated with cord occlusions due to torsion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F93966\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93966 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Examination of the umbilical cord provides information about fetal growth and activity in utero. Cords with no coiling are associated with poor fetal growth and decreased activity, and may result from severe neural and musculoskeletal anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Several studies have reported an increased frequency of adverse pregnancy outcome, including congenital anomalies, growth restriction, fetal heart rate abnormalities, preterm birth, and intrauterine death in patients with an uncoiled umbilical cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. Both hypocoiled and hypercoiled umbilical cords are associated with an increased frequency of small for gestational age neonates (15 to 16 percent versus 5 percent with normocoiled cords for both) and nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns (22 to 29 percent versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H63689559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Cord coiling'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Placental insertion site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical cord normally inserts centrally or slightly eccentrically and directly into the placental disk. Fewer than 10 percent of insertions occur at the margin of the placenta (battledore placenta) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81936\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81936 \">picture 5</a>) and even fewer insert into the membranes (velamentous insertion). Abnormal cord insertions should be noted and histologic examination of any membranous vessels should be undertaken to look for thrombi and vascular anomalies, which are associated with these abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Abnormalities of umbilical cord insertion are more common in pregnancies resulting from in vitro fertilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>] and in multiple gestations. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Velamentous cord insertion</strong> &ndash; A velamentous cord insertion refers to a cord that inserts into the membranes rather than the placental disk. The velamentous vessels are surrounded only by fetal membranes, with no Wharton's jelly, thus they are prone to compression or disruption. Velamentous vessels can also occur between lobes of a bilobed placenta or between the main placenta and accessory lobes. Velamentous umbilical cord has been associated with several obstetrical complications, including fetal growth restriction, prematurity, congenital anomalies, and low Apgar score. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Velamentous umbilical cord insertion and vasa previa&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Furcate insertion</strong> &ndash; A furcate (forked) cord is a rare variation of the velamentous cord. The fetal vessels are also unsupported by Wharton's jelly, but they separate from each other and fan out to form a vascular &quot;tent&quot; just above the disk. Although the appearance is worrisome, furcate cords are rarely associated with an adverse pregnancy outcome, although they have an increased risk for early delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Marginal insertion</strong> &ndash; A marginal cord insertion refers to an otherwise normal umbilical cord located at the edge of the placenta, and occurs in about 6 percent of pregnancies. It has normal amount of Wharton&rsquo;s jelly, in contrast to a velamentous insertion, which is also often at the placental margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cord length increases with advancing gestational age; other variables have a modest effect on length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The average length at term is about 55 cm, with a wide normal range (35 to 77 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/19,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31,32</a>]. The length should be noted and compared with published standards, an example is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76589 \">table 3</a>). The length measurement should include the portion of cord on the infant after cord transection at delivery as well as the part remaining with the placenta, thus it is best determined in the delivery room. If the length of the cord attached to the infant is not provided to the pathologist, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> cannot determine whether the total length of cord (placental portion plus infant portion) is shorter than normal and will not make the diagnosis of &quot;short umbilical cord&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76589 \">table 3</a>). A &quot;long umbilical cord&quot; is diagnosed when more than 70 cm of cord is received at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/9,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,33,34</a>].</p><p>The length of the umbilical cord can be of critical importance when evaluating a case of perinatal morbidity or mortality. Cord length is determined in part by hereditary factors, but also, it is thought, by the tension the fetus places on the cord when it moves. For this reason, short cords are associated with fetal inactivity often related to fetal malformations, myopathic and neuropathic diseases, oligohydramnios, and some syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/20,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,35</a>]. Long cords may be caused by a hyperactive fetus and have been associated with cord accidents, such as entanglement, knotting, and prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Long cords are also associated with placental lesions indicative of intrauterine hypoxia such as delayed villous maturation, as well as fetal death, fetal growth restriction, and long term adverse neurologic outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, the longer route that blood must travel to and from the fetal heart when the cord is very long may result in fetal heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Knots</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>False knots</strong> -- False knots are tortuousities of the umbilical vessels that form bulges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68053\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68053 \">picture 6</a>); they are not associated with any adverse outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>True knots</strong> -- True knots occur in 1 percent of births and are generally single and loose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62702\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62702 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, tight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71345\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71345 \">picture 8</a>) or multiple true knots and knots associated with coiling or twisting of the cord increase the risk of intrauterine demise, particularly if the cord is long and during the second trimester when the fetus has a lot of room to move. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The medical record should document the presence of a true knot, the tightness or laxity of the knot, the presence of unilateral edema of the cord relative to the knot, and whether there are thrombi in the vessels. A pathologist should obtain a section through the knot for histologic examination to diagnose inflammation, necrosis, or thrombosis in the vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities#H13962068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis and management of umbilical cord abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Knots'</a>.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Vessels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single umbilical vein conducts blood from the placenta back to the fetus and is essential for fetal survival. The two umbilical arteries pump blood from the fetus to the placenta. Their redundancy is evident, given that the presence of a single umbilical artery or hypoplastic second umbilical artery is not lethal.</p><p/><p>The number of umbilical vessels are best counted by cutting the cord in a relatively uniform region (away from bulges of false knots) at least 5 cm from the placental insertion since the two arteries sometimes fuse near the insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Two vessel cords should be documented in the medical record and confirmed by histological examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=single-umbilical-artery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Single umbilical artery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H4507457\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Single umbilical artery'</a>.)</p><p>Vessels that are expanded and contain laminated thrombi are abnormal and should be investigated. Possible etiologies include cord compression from a true knot, cord prolapse, or head compression; marginal or membranous cord insertion; a fetal hypercoagulable state (eg, sepsis, hereditary thrombophilia); and maternal diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>True hemangiomas of the umbilical cord are also rare, and associated with fetal death. These present as mass-like lesions of considerable length and diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53360\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53360 \">picture 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2196416088\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematomas due to trauma at delivery are commonly observed near the cord clamp and at the insertion of the cord into the placental disk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70927\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70927 \">picture 10</a>). True spontaneous hematomas of the umbilical cord do occur, but are rare and often lethal. </p><p>Spontaneous hematomas present as large umbilical cord masses and can compress the umbilical vein, resulting in fetal death. In the author's opinion the cord vessel that ruptured and caused the hematoma likely was weakened by damage due to either inflammatory, toxic (meconium), or pressure necrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1488507253\"><span class=\"h2\">Neoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare anomalies of the cord sometimes noted macroscopically include teratomas, cysts, and angiomyxomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].

They can occur anywhere along the length of the cord. First trimester umbilical cord cysts noted on ultrasound are often transient and have no clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. Persistent cysts have been associated with a variety of fetal anomalies (particularly patent urachus and omphalocele), but the true prevalence of fetal anomalies in these patients cannot be determined from the small retrospective case reports and series that have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

These specimens should incorporate the most distal, most proximal, and mid sections of the cord, as well as any areas that appear abnormal. Cords that are abnormally colored, especially due to meconium, should be extensively sectioned (at least three cassettes). The sections should be labeled so they can be oriented by the pathologist. Sections through the knot should be obtained to examine for vascular damage (necrosis, inflammation, thrombosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MEMBRANES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The placental membranes are composed of two layers: the layer nearest the fetus (facing the amniotic cavity) is the amnion and the outer layer is the chorion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75084\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75084 \">figure 2</a>). The amnion and chorion are derived from extraembryonic tissues of the zygote. A space, which is a remnant of the early gestational sac, separates the two layers until approximately 14 weeks of gestation, at which time the amnion and chorion adhere to one another. </p><p>Fetal membranes do not contain blood vessels or nerves. The tensile strength and elastic properties of fetal membranes allow them to accommodate to the changing needs of the fetus across gestation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Color</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal membranes are translucent, slightly gray, and glistening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65014\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65014 \">picture 11</a>). Abnormal membrane color or clarity suggests the presence of pathology. As an example, meconium stains the membrane <span class=\"nowrap\">green/yellow,</span> hemosiderin stains the membrane brown, and infection stains the membrane yellow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56454%7EOBGYN%2F77902\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56454 graphicRef77902 \">picture 12A-B</a>); a tan membrane may represent a combination of these problems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66875\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66875 \">picture 13</a>).

Small, flat, pearly white lesions that adhere to the amnion near the cord insertion site may represent squamous metaplasia, a normal finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68291\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68291 \">picture 14</a>). Subchorionic nodules of fibrin deposits are also a common, normal finding. </p><p>By comparison, nodules on the fetal surface of the amnion are unusual and suggest a disease process, such as abscesses or amnion nodosum. These nodules should be evaluated histologically.

The membranes usually emerge from the disk smoothly and flush with the margin; this is referred to as a marginal insertion. There may be an increased risk of fetal morbidity when the membranes originate from just inside the margin of the disk (circummarginate) or from deep inside the margin (circumvallate) due to abnormally deep implantation in the disk or early marginal hemorrhage at implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Circumvallate placenta'</a> below and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Circummarginate placenta'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory preparation for histologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After inspection of the membranes, pathologist should obtain two membrane rolls: one at the site of rupture and one from an unruptured area. A 2 cm wide strip of membranes should be cut from the area most distal from the disk to the disk, including a small portion of disk margin. Any membranous vessels (either due to velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord or a &quot;wandering&quot; membranous vessel) should be sampled in a roll. The membranes can be wrapped like a &quot;jelly roll&quot; around a pair of forceps (or similar instrument) while holding the marginal piece of placenta and placed in formalin. One transverse section from each roll is used for histologic examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76740 \">picture 15</a>). The remaining membranes can be trimmed off the disk and discarded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PARENCHYMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The placental parenchyma is composed of a branching, highly vascularized stromal compartment lined or covered by trophoblast. The stroma is mesoderm derived from the zygote and filled with vascular channels. The trophoblast expresses unique antigens (HLA-G and Fas ligand) that promote its graft-like immunological acceptance (tolerance) by the antigenically dissimilar maternal host with whom it interfaces. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-development-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental development and physiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunology of the maternal-fetal interface&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disk (without membranes and umbilical cord) should be weighed and the weight compared with standards (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72177 \">table 4</a>). The amount of blood in the placenta comprises a significant proportion of total weight and is affected by iatrogenic factors, such as whether the placenta is drained prior to delivery.</p><p>Placental weight correlates with birth weight; normal values of the fetal-to-placenta weight ratio change during the course of gestation (approximately 1:4 at 27 weeks, increasing to approximately 1:7 at term). Placental weights significantly deviating from the normal range should prompt consideration for special studies, such as viral cultures, flow cytometry, or genetic studies. Maternal diabetes mellitus, fetal or maternal anemia, fetal hydrops, and congenital syphilis are associated with high placental weight. Preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and some aneuploidies (not trisomy 21) and infections are associated with low placental weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Dimensions and appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal term placental disk is a single, relatively symmetrical discoid organ that occupies about one-fifth of the surface of the chorionic sac. The dimensions of the placenta should be recorded. A normal term placenta is at 2 to 4 cm thick and about 20 cm in diameter. Thickness is measured after cutting, and size is represented by the major and minor diameters of the usually <span class=\"nowrap\">ovoid/round</span> disk.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maternal surface</strong> &ndash; The maternal surface is maroon and divided into lobules or cotyledons, which should be inspected to ensure that all are present (that the placenta is complete). Blood clot (fresh or organized) adherent to the maternal surface, especially if it distorts the cotyledons, may represent an abruption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parenchyma</strong> &ndash; The parenchyma should be a spongy, soft, red tissue. Mottled colors and firm areas may be abnormal and should be noted. Firm areas in the placenta may be related to fibrin deposition or infarction. Fresh infarcts are red, while older infarcts and fibrin deposits are gray (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82377\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82377 \">picture 16</a>). In a normal sized placenta, infarcts or fibrin occupying less than 5 percent of the placental mass are not clinically important, but larger areas are associated with fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, and neurological sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Parenchymal infarcts, syncytial knotting, and other lesions associated with malperfusion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental pathology in cases of neurologically impaired infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An orange rind-like band of fibrin deposition along the maternal floor is suspicious for a maternal floor infarction, a lesion that carries significant morbidity and recurrence risk (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H4507189\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Maternal floor infarction/massive perivillous fibrin deposition'</a>). Increased fibrin can present as a plaque (isolated nodule) or diffusely throughout the placenta. This should be noted and well sampled. Diffuse fibrin deposition is a diagnostic feature of massive perivillous fibrin deposition, which has significant associated morbidity and mortality, as well as a high recurrence risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H4507189\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Maternal floor infarction/massive perivillous fibrin deposition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe fetal anemia may cause the placenta to appear pale and hydropic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50241\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50241 \">picture 17</a>). One should consider all of the etiologies of fetal anemia, including maternal-fetal hemorrhage and ABO incompatibilities, and, if the clinical situation supports it, consideration of maternal antibody and Kleihauer-Betke analysis might be suggested based on the placental examination alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Calcification (calcium speckling) may be observed and palpated over the basal surface of the cotyledons. It is a normal part of placental maturation in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], and occurs earlier in smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Placental calcification in the second trimester is an abnormal finding; most studies have found an association with adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, fetal growth restriction, fetal distress) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Second trimester calcification is often associated with placental infarction or perivillous fibrin deposition, which are signs of placental insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mass lesions, which may consist of infarcts, intervillous thrombi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53438\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53438 \">picture 18</a>), cysts, tumors, or abscesses, are abnormal and should be examined histologically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetal surface</strong> &ndash; The fetal surface of the placenta is shiny, gray, and translucent. The chorionic vessels along the fetal surface of the placenta can be examined easily through the transparent amnion and chorion covering them. The fetal surface is inspected to look for large vessels coursing to the edge, which suggest a placental lobe (succenturiate or accessory lobe) may have torn away and left behind in the uterus. It is also important to note the presence of cysts, subchorionic hematomas, squamous metaplasia, amnion nodosum, and thrombi or calcification of vessels. Hemorrhage between the amnion and chorion is usually an artifact related to traction on the cord during delivery of the placenta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Placental variants</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Placenta succenturiata</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placenta succenturiata refers to a placenta with an <span class=\"nowrap\">additional/accessory</span> lobe or lobes of placental tissue located a few centimeters away. A placental artery and vein extend from and within the membrane of the main placental mass to each lobe and then divide into smaller vessels supplying individual cotyledons. The ancillary lobes function normally, but can be associated with complications such as placenta previa or vasa previa. In addition, the succenturiate lobe(s) may be retained after the main placental disk has been delivered. This can result in postpartum hemorrhage or infection days or weeks after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Placenta membranacea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placenta membranacea refers to a rare type of placenta in which the chorionic sac is covered by functional placental tissue. These placentas are very thin and deeply implanted (with occasional placenta accreta), thus requiring manual removal. They are associated with slightly increased risks of second trimester miscarriage, preterm birth, and antepartum and postpartum bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gross-examination-of-the-placenta/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Duplex, bipartite, and tripartite placentas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplex placenta (ie, bilobed placenta) refers to complete separation of the placenta into two lobes with separate umbilical arteries and veins that unite in a single umbilical cord. Bipartite (bidiscoidal) and tripartite (tridiscoidal) placentas do not have as complete a separation between lobes as the duplex placenta. The incomplete parenchymal separation typically occurs in the area of the cord insertion site, which may be very thin or absent (fenestrate placenta).</p><p>The umbilical cord of such placentas may insert into a chorionic bridge between lobes. More commonly, membranous vessels extend between lobes or from either lobe to the cord. When the vessels are membranous (velamentous), vasa previa, compression, and thrombosis are major concerns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Circumvallate placenta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circumvallate placenta refers to a placenta with an unusually small chorionic plate, but with growth of extrachorial placental tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67822\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67822 \">picture 19</a>). A double layer of amnion and chorion, as well as necrotic villi and fibrin, form a raised white ring around the surface of the placental disk at a variable distance from the umbilical cord insertion site; the fetal vessels do not extend beyond this ring. The extrachorionic tissue constitutes a small proportion of the placenta and usually does not compromise fetomaternal exchange. However, these placentas are more prone to premature separation and second trimester bleeding is common.
