These conditions are due to abnormalities of the developing fetal or infantile brain resulting from a variety of causes. Although the disorder itself is not progressive, the clinical expression may change over time as the brain matures. The motor impairment generally results in limitations in functional abilities and activity which can range in severity. Multiple additional symptoms often accompany the primary motor abnormalities, including altered sensation or perception, intellectual disability, communication and behavioral difficulties, seizure disorders, and musculoskeletal complications. Although the underlying etiology itself is not progressive, the clinical expression may change over time as the brain matures.</p><p>The evaluation and diagnosis of CP are discussed here.

Our recommendations are consistent with the practice parameter from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Child Neurology Society (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338441414\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI of the brain should be performed in all children with CP if the etiology has not yet been established (eg, by neuroimaging in the neonatal period) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51656\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51656 \">algorithm 1</a>). The timing of when to perform the MRI depends on the clinical circumstances. Early imaging is warranted in severely affected children and those with concerning findings (eg, considerable motor asymmetry). For children with subtle clinical findings, waiting until approximately two years of age to account for myelination may be a better option, since subtle findings may be missed on earlier imaging. MRI should be repeated if there is a notable change or deviation from the expected clinical course or if there are red flags for a progressive neurologic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H338440771\" class=\"local\">'Findings suggesting an alternative diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>MRI is preferred over computed tomography (CT) because it generally has a higher diagnostic yield and can be helpful in determining both the etiology and the timing of insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additionally, CT exposes the developing brain to a large dose of radiation. CT can be helpful in urgent settings such as intracranial hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to neuroimaging in children&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Cranial ultrasound is a neuroimaging modality that can be used in neonates and young infants who have an open anterior fontanel. Many patients presenting for evaluation of suspected CP are beyond the age where this study can be performed. However, some may have had prior cranial ultrasounds performed in early infancy (eg, during a neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] stay). Ultrasonography can identify hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and hydrocephalus, but it is not sensitive for white matter injury. In the context of evaluating a child for CP, abnormal findings on cranial ultrasound should generally be followed up with MRI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to neuroimaging in children&quot;, section on 'Ultrasonography'</a>.)</p><p>The MRI is abnormal in approximately 90 percent of children with CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The diagnostic yield depends upon the type of CP (mixed &gt; quadriplegic &gt; hemiplegic &gt; diplegic &gt; ataxic &gt; dyskinetic) and the timing of birth (scans are more often abnormal in preterm compared with term infants). MRI, in combination with the clinical history, can help determine whether the injury was prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal in onset. Timing of an injury cannot be determined by MRI alone unless obtained in the acute setting.</p><p>MRI abnormalities in patients with CP include hypoxic-ischemic lesions, (eg, periventricular leukomalacia [PVL]), cortical malformations, and lesions of the basal ganglia. The range of abnormalities is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of MRI findings in 40 patients with CP, periventricular white matter injury was observed in 9 of 11 children who were born preterm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among the 29 children who were born at term, three patterns of lesions were identified: gyral anomalies, isolated PVL, and watershed cortical or deep gray nuclear damage. These lesions are consistent with injury in the mid-second trimester, late-second or early-third trimester, and late-third trimester or perinatal or postnatal period, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 56 children with bilateral spastic CP, 91 percent had specific pathology on an MRI performed at a mean age of 10.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. PVL was seen in 97 percent of preterm and 42 percent of term children. Parasagittal subcortical injury, multicystic encephalomalacia, and basal ganglia lesions were seen in nine children (16 percent), eight of whom has severe <span class=\"nowrap\">peri-/neonatal</span> events at term or near term. Dysmorphology was noted in five children (9 percent), four of whom were born at term.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging in ataxic CP may be normal or show biparietal or infratentorial lesions. In a series of 29 affected patients studied with CT, abnormalities were identified in the parietal lobes or posterior fossa in 55 and 28 percent, respectively; scans were normal or only slightly abnormal in 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338441635\"><span class=\"h3\">Lumbar puncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar puncture (LP) is <strong>not</strong> routinely necessary in the evaluation of most children with CP.

All infants should be screened for hearing loss in the newborn period. In addition to newborn screening, children with CP should have at least one formal audiologic assessment by 24 to 30 months of age or sooner if concerns are raised in the history and clinical assessment.

Growth should be monitored closely in children with CP. Those with milder CP may have normal growth, while those with more severe motor impairment often have growth failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Frequently this correlates with inadequate nutritional intake, which can be multifactorial in etiology. Children with quadriplegic CP are at increased risk for poor growth compared with those with diplegic or hemiplegic CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lifeexpectancy.org/articles/GrowthCharts.shtml&amp;token=ZGsT8ucp35L8A9uSWehO1cpeXTgK2we76lQQcYbibwL4KuB89P/E0UVW6F23wwEbPl61BeEMyg8cuwler9q+tq8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6169\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Growth charts specific to CP</a> have been developed that use weight-for-age (not weight-for-height) to measure nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Patients with weights below this threshold should undergo a nutritional evaluation, including evaluation of caloric intake and exploration of alternative explanations for low body weight, such as familial short stature. If undernutrition is confirmed, concerted efforts should be made to boost nutrition through oral supplements or enteral feeds.

There is no test that confirms or excludes CP. In severe cases, the diagnosis can be made soon after birth, but for the majority, the diagnosis is established in the first two years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Key features in the diagnosis of CP include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal motor development and posture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain injury is permanent and nonprogressive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor impairment is attributed to an insult that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor impairment results in limitations in functional abilities and activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor impairment is often accompanied by secondary musculoskeletal problems, epilepsy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behavior.</p><p/><p>The diagnosis should not be based upon an isolated abnormality. Infants with mild hypertonia or hyperreflexia who otherwise have normal functional development should be observed. If the abnormality remains isolated, in most cases it will resolve progressively after the child reaches nine months of age.</p><p>A definitive diagnosis of CP requires serial examinations. In a study of infants at high risk for CP who had serial examinations for two years, the presence of three or more abnormal signs at eight months of age was highly predictive of CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, CP often was missed at one month and sometimes overdiagnosed at four months.</p><p>Clues to an early diagnosis include abnormal behavior (eg, excessive docility or irritability), abnormal tone, abnormal posture, persistence of primitive reflexes, and failure to achieve motor milestones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102836%7EPEDS%2F103006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102836 graphicRef103006 \">table 2A-B</a>). Early signs of CP differ somewhat based upon the CP subtype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533 \">table 3</a>). In many cases, spasticity may not be identified until six months of age. Dyskinetic patterns are often not apparent until approximately 18 months. Ataxia may not become obvious until even later.
