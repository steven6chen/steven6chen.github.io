Some kidneys do not regain function even with maximal antirejection therapy.</p><p>Even among patients who recover, acute rejection episodes can have a negative impact on long-term graft survival. Acute rejection is a major predictor of interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/tubular</span> atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">(IF/TA),</span> formerly called chronic allograft nephropathy, which is responsible for most death-censored graft loss after the first year posttransplant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic renal allograft nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Importance of acute rejection'</a>.)</p><p>There has been a dramatic reduction in the incidence of acute rejection due to the introduction of potent immunosuppressive drugs in the past three decades. However, optimizing immunosuppression to both prevent allograft rejection and minimize drug toxicity, new-onset diabetes, dyslipidemia, infection, and malignancy remains challenging.</p><p>A discussion of the clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection is presented in this topic review. The evaluation of renal allograft dysfunction and the treatment of acute rejection are presented separately.

There are two principal histologic forms of acute rejection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection</strong> (TCMR), which is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the tubules, interstitium, and, in some cases, the arterial intima.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute antibody-mediated rejection</strong> (ABMR), the diagnosis of which requires morphologic evidence of acute tissue injury, circulating donor-specific alloantibodies, and immunologic evidence of an antibody-mediated process (such as C4d deposition in the allograft).</p><p/><p>ABMR and acute TCMR may coexist at the same time in the allograft.</p><p><strong>Subclinical rejection</strong> is defined as the presence of histologic evidence of acute rejection on biopsy without an elevation in the serum creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. Subclinical rejection is primarily detected by a protocol, or surveillance, biopsy, which is obtained at a protocol-driven, prespecified time after transplantation rather than for a clinical indication such as allograft dysfunction. Most of the reports of subclinical rejection involve TCMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. However, there are reports of allografts with histologic manifestations of ABMR in the absence of functional deterioration of kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H792382040\" class=\"local\">'Subclinical rejection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H417236440\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H792385721\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advent of calcineurin inhibitors and antiproliferative agents dramatically lowered the incidence of acute rejection. Among adult patients who received allografts between 2005 and 2009, the incidence of one episode of acute rejection over five years following transplantation was approximately 17 percent for living-donor kidneys and 20 percent for deceased-donor kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. By comparison, at least one acute rejection episode occurred in 50 to 60 percent of renal allograft recipients in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The incidence of acute rejection among first-year posttransplant patients decreased from 10 percent in 2009 to 2010 to 8 percent in 2013 to 2014, as reported by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall, the rate of acute rejection in the first year posttransplant is 1 to 2 percent lower in living-donor than deceased-donor kidney transplants. This difference is probably related to better matching in living-donor transplants and less cold ischemia time.</p><p>Risk factors for the development of acute rejection include pre-sensitization (ie, presence of donor-specific antibodies [DSAs] or a high panel reactive antibody [PRA]), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches, pediatric recipient, African-American ethnicity, blood group incompatibility, prolonged cold ischemia time, and delayed graft function (DGF). In addition, patients with a previous episode of rejection, those receiving a second or greater transplant, and those with medication nonadherence are at increased risk for acute rejection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults#H109789484\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'Determining risk of acute rejection'</a>.)</p><p>Acute rejection episodes are generally associated with a reduction in long-term allograft survival, although not all rejection episodes have the same impact on long-term graft function. Factors such as timing of rejection, severity and number of acute rejections, and degree of recovery of function after treatment all affect the long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. If renal function returns to baseline, acute rejection does not necessarily cause irreparable damage or impact long-term graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite significant reductions in the incidence of acute rejection over the last decade, there has not been a similar improvement in long-term allograft survival. The underlying reasons for this are unclear. Possibilities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients that are at high risk for T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) are also at high risk for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). Although the use of potent induction agents may prevent acute TCMR in predisposed recipients, these patients may develop early interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/tubular</span> atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">(IF/TA)</span> that is antibody mediated and not easy to diagnose or treat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The beneficial effects of lower incidence of acute rejection are offset by the negative effects of calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity and overimmunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More potent induction therapy might prevent acute rejections that would have responded well to therapy. This leaves ABMR and mixed TCMR and ABMR that frequently do not respond as well.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H792382040\"><span class=\"h2\">Subclinical rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As defined above, subclinical rejection is when histologic changes of acute rejection are observed in the absence of an increased serum creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. The incidence of subclinical rejection in the first six months after a renal transplantation is highly variable and depends on several factors including degree of HLA matching, presence of DSAs, immunosuppressive protocol, and the incidence of DGF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>As is acute rejection, subclinical rejection may be less common in the current era of immunosuppressive regimens. As an example, in a multicenter, randomized trial of 240 renal transplant recipients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>/glucocorticoids,</span> the overall prevalence of subclinical rejection was only 4.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], compared with a much higher prevalence cited in previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Reduced rates of acute and subclinical rejection may also be related to the increased sensitivity of pretransplant testing for preformed anti-HLA antibodies, which improves the compatibility of transplanted organs.</p><p>One multicenter study examined the incidence of histologic manifestations of ABMR in 551 protocol and 377 indication biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The major histologic finding under study was C4d staining, which was generally associated with other morphologic evidence of ABMR. Diffuse and focal C4d staining was observed in 2.0 and 2.4 percent of protocol biopsies, respectively, and in 12.2 and 8.5 percent of indication biopsies, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The incidence of C4d-positive biopsies varied significantly among centers, with a higher percentage of C4d-positive biopsies noted at a center that transplanted a higher percentage of sensitized patients. In another study from Europe, positive C4d staining was detected in 36 percent of patients with subclinical ABMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Many [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/1,2,4,22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,22-27</a>], though not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>], studies have demonstrated an association between subclinical rejection demonstrated by protocol biopsy and decreased allograft survival <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 435 protocol biopsies, subclinical rejection with <span class=\"nowrap\">IF/TA</span> was an independent predictor of allograft loss (relative risk [RR] 1.86, 95% CI 1.11-3.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of 833 protocol and 306 clinically indicated biopsies found that the presence of persistent inflammation on sequential biopsies was a significant determinant of allograft function independent of an increased serum creatinine; the prevalence of inflammatory infiltrates was the same between protocol and clinically indicated biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>Overall, patients with subclinical ABMR exhibit worse graft function compared with those who have subclinical TCMR. In one study, graft survival at eight years in patients with subclinical ABMR (defined as stable renal function with histologic features of capillaritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glomerulitis and evidence of DSA) detected on protocol biopsy at one year posttransplant was 56 percent, compared with 88 percent in those with subclinical TCMR. All patients with subclinical ABMR had a DSA at the time of the biopsy, and 22 percent had a de novo DSA. Patients with subclinical TCMR had similar graft survival as those without rejection (90 percent at eight years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The significance of subclinical C4d staining in relation to chronic ABMR, <span class=\"nowrap\">IF/TA,</span> and long-term graft function is not clear. The 2005 Banff diagnostic criteria changed the ABMR category to reflect the finding of C4d in some cases of chronic allograft dysfunction, suggesting that ABMR is a likely contributor to some forms of chronic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>It is unclear if the administration of therapy to patients with subclinical rejection improves clinical outcomes. This is discussed elsewhere.

Rejection after 12 months is typically from noncompliance or overaggressive reduction in immunosuppression.</p><p>Most patients who have acute rejection episodes are asymptomatic. However, occasionally, patients present with fever, malaise, oliguria, and graft pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These manifestations are uncommon with modern immunosuppressive drug regimens, particularly calcineurin inhibitors, unless immunosuppression is completely discontinued. Since most patients are asymptomatic, acute rejection is suggested only by an increase in the serum creatinine or proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient#H1769728797\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of care of the adult kidney transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Monitoring renal allograft function'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of the patient with renal allograft dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H417236522\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute allograft rejection present with an acute rise in the serum creatinine. A rising serum creatinine level, however, is a relatively late development in the course of a rejection episode and usually indicates the presence of significant histologic damage. Pyuria or new or worsening proteinuria may also be present.</p><p>Plasma levels of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), which is released into the bloodstream by dead cells in the injured allograft, may be elevated (&gt;1 percent) in patients with acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In one study, plasma levels of dd-cfDNA were measured in 102 renal transplant recipients and correlated with allograft rejection status as determined by renal allograft biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The dd-cfDNA level was able to differentiate between biopsy specimens showing any form of rejection (T cell-mediated rejection [TCMR] or antibody-mediated rejection [ABMR]) and those without rejection. Using a cutoff of 1.0 percent, dd-cfDNA had a positive and negative predictive value for active rejection of 61 and 84 percent, respectively. These findings suggest that dd-cfDNA may serve as a noninvasive biomarker for the diagnosis of allograft rejection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515116843\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most findings obtained by renal imaging are nonspecific, and such studies are generally performed to exclude other causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). Ultrasonography may show increased graft size, with loss of corticomedullary junction, prominent hypoechoic pyramids, and decreased echogenicity of the renal sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Renal Doppler studies obtained via ultrasound may show elevated resistance indices (RIs), but this finding is not specific and may also be observed with ureteral obstruction, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), renal vein occlusion, pyelonephritis, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

However, among transplant recipients, there are other potential causes of an increased serum creatinine that do not require a biopsy to diagnose and should be excluded prior to performing a biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction#H3912095140\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of the patient with renal allograft dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Patients presenting with an elevated serum creatinine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2872097419\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect acute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute renal allograft rejection should be suspected in patients with one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New increase in serum creatinine of &ge;25 percent from baseline <strong>or</strong> a serum creatinine that is higher than expected (such as in recently transplanted patients whose serum creatinine stops decreasing earlier than expected after transplantation). However, in patients who are at increased risk for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) (eg, highly sensitized patients, recipients of ABO-incompatible renal allografts, patients with donor-specific antibodies [DSAs], and patients with inadequate immunosuppression), any incremental increase in serum creatinine should raise the suspicion for the possibility of acute rejection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteinuria &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) &gt;1 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1597517070\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirming the diagnosis of rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard for the diagnosis of renal allograft rejection is a renal allograft biopsy, which is used to accurately grade the severity of rejection, differentiate between T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) and ABMR, and determine the degree of irreversible kidney damage (interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/tubular</span> atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">[IF/TA])</span>. Biopsy of the renal allograft can also reveal other causes of renal inflammation and injury, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, BK (polyomavirus) nephropathy, interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, de novo or recurrent glomerular disease, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>There have been various attempts to standardize the histologic criteria for acute rejection in order to allow comparisons of efficacy of different therapies and to help guide treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Classification systems that have been introduced include the Banff classification system, published in 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and the Cooperative Clinical Trials in Transplantation (CCTT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Both classification systems focused upon inflammation involving arteries and tubules and did not incorporate evidence of glomerulitis, since the significance of glomerulitis is unclear. The Banff and the CCTT systems were both incorporated into the Banff 97 classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Increased histologic severity based upon the 1997 Banff classification correlated with unresponsiveness to therapy and decreased allograft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The Banff 97 diagnostic categories have since been modestly revised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/28,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,40-42</a>]. The Banff 2011 Conference on Allograft Pathology recognized the existence of C4d-negative ABMR in renal allografts but stopped short of adding a diagnostic category of C4d-negative ABMR. Diagnostic criteria for C4d-negative ABMR were incorporated into the 2013 Banff update [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3278497862\" class=\"local\">'Acute antibody-mediated rejection'</a> below.)</p><p>It may be difficult to distinguish between acute ABMR and severe acute TCMR, and the two processes may also coexist. In addition, in up to 25 percent of cases of allograft dysfunction attributed, at least in part, to ABMR, the histologic findings are suggestive of only TCMR or acute tubular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It is important to identify ABMR, if possible, since it is often refractory to treatment modalities aimed at acute TCMR and, unless adequately treated, often results in renal allograft loss.</p><p>Other methods used to help diagnosis acute renal allograft rejection have been the focus of a large number of investigators and are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational methods in the diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346691042\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute TCMR is caused by T cells that react to donor histocompatibility antigens present within tubules, interstitium, vessels, and glomeruli of the allograft. The pathologic changes that occur with acute TCMR include interstitial infiltration with mononuclear cells, and, occasionally eosinophils, and disruption of the tubular basement membranes by the infiltrating cells (ie, tubulitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Tubulitis and interstitial mononuclear cell inflammation are the primary lesions. Intimal arteritis may be seen in TCMR but can also be found in ABMR. The presence of patchy mononuclear cell infiltrates without tubulitis is not uncommon in normal functioning renal allografts and is not, by itself, sufficient to make the diagnosis of acute TCMR.

C4d is a degradation product of the classic complement pathway. After an antigen-antibody complex fixes complement, a cascade of events follows, with activation of several complement proteins. The complement protein C4 is split into C4a and C4b. C4b is then converted to C4d. A unique feature of C4d is that it binds covalently to the endothelial and collagen basement membranes, thereby serving as an immunologic footprint of complement activation and antibody-mediated injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In normal kidneys, C4d is detectable in the glomerular mesangium and at the vascular pole. Deposition of C4d in the PTCs has only been described in renal allografts and represents complement activity directed against donor antigen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68422\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68422 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In an early study of 16 indication allograft biopsies from 10 patients with circulating DSA and histopathologic findings suggestive of ABMR, diffusely positive PTC C4d staining was observed in all biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. C4d deposition was seen in the media of arteries displaying fibrinoid necrosis. In addition, C4d staining in PTC was negative in 14 biopsies with acute TCMR (without DSA), in five of six cases of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> toxicity, and in four normal biopsies. Forty percent of grafts with ABMR were lost, compared with none of those with acute TCMR alone.</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of C4d for DSA have also been investigated. In a study of 81 patients with acute rejection, 30 percent had detectable C4d. C4d was found to be 95 percent sensitive and 96 percent specific for the presence of DSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In patients with circulating DSA, inferior graft function and survival have been observed in those with C4d-positive versus -negative staining, suggesting that C4d is a marker of more significant humoral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>].</p><p>Collectively, the findings of these studies have led to general acceptance of the utility of C4d in the identification of acute ABMR.

The concept of C4d-negative ABMR was introduced in a retrospective study of 1036 renal allograft biopsies from 1320 transplant recipients; only 36 percent of cases with transplant glomerulopathy (a histologic lesion that is characteristic of chronic [late] ABMR) had C4d-positive staining, despite the presence of DSAs in 73 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence for C4d-negative ABMR came from a molecular study in which gene expression microarrays were performed in 173 indication biopsies to examine endothelial activation and injury transcripts (ENDATs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/58,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,70</a>].

In one study of 54 presensitized (DSA-positive) renal transplant recipients who underwent protocol biopsies at three months posttransplant, the presence of capillaritis, even in the absence of C4d, was a risk factor for the later development of transplant glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/10,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,71</a>]. In a second study of 98 renal allograft biopsies performed for clinical indications within the first three months posttransplant, 16 had histologic evidence of ABMR and DSAs but were C4d negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Patients with C4d-negative ABMR who were not treated for ABMR had a higher rate of progression to transplant glomerulopathy compared with those who were treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2347586386\"><span class=\"h4\">Detection of donor-specific antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to detect DSAs and diagnose ABMR has improved markedly with the addition of flow cytometric analysis and solid-phase assays such as Luminex (single HLA-coated microspheres) to standard cytotoxicity assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The presence of DSAs in patients with renal allograft dysfunction can provide significant diagnostic and prognostic information. In a study of 103 renal transplant recipients with increased serum creatinine values, testing for HLA and non-HLA antibodies was performed using flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. C4d-positive acute rejection was eventually diagnosed in 75 percent of those positive for HLA antibodies but in only 2 percent of those without such antibodies. Posttransplant screening for the development of DSAs may also permit the early detection of acute ABMR and allograft dysfunction, particularly in high-risk patients. In a single-center, prospective study of 49 transplant recipients, the majority of patients with ABMR developed DSAs before or concurrent with the ABMR event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. By comparison, only 3 of 41 without ABMR developed DSAs.</p><p>DSAs detected by a sensitive solid-phase assay may provide additional prognostic data. In a meta-analysis that included seven retrospective cohort studies (1119 patients), the presence of DSAs detected by solid-phase assay, but not by flow cytometry, was associated with nearly twice the risk for ABMR (relative risk [RR] 1.98, 95% CI 1.36&ndash;2.89) and increased the risk for graft failure (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.13&ndash;2.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In a single-center study, 315 Canadian renal transplant recipients (72 percent Caucasian) were followed prospectively with serial DSAs by single-bead assays and protocol biopsies over a mean six-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In this low-risk population, DSAs, defined as a mean fluorescent intensity &gt;300, developed in 15 percent of patients over six years. The 10-year graft survival rate was lower among those with de novo DSAs, compared with those without (56 versus 96 percent, respectively). However, some patients who developed DSAs did well, suggesting that, although development of de novo DSAs is associated with inferior graft survival, not all DSAs may be pathogenic.</p><p>The presence of nonpathogenic DSAs is also supported by a study of 1016 patients who received kidney transplants at two centers between 2005 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. All patients were tested for circulating HLA DSAs using stored serum samples, which were obtained at the time of transplantation and at the time of allograft biopsy (which was performed either at one year after transplantation or during an episode of acute rejection during the first year after transplantation). Serum samples of patients who were found to have HLA DSAs were further tested for the presence of C1q-binding HLA DSAs using a single-antigen flow bead assay. ABMR was more common among patients with C1q-binding antibodies, compared with those with non-C1q-binding antibodies (48 versus 16 percent, respectively). Patients with C1q-binding HLA DSAs also had inferior five-year graft survival compared with patients with non-C1q-binding DSAs (54 versus 93 percent, respectively). It is important to note that patients with non-C1q-binding HLA DSAs had lower graft survival and worse histologic features (such as microvascular inflammation, C4d deposition, and transplant glomerulopathy) than those without DSAs.</p><p>The C1q-binding assay is not widely used and has not been validated in other institutions. There is concern that the C1q-binding assay may reflect a higher burden of antibody, and the assay itself may not be an accurate reflection of inherent complement-binding activity independent of antibody quantity. Furthermore, it is likely that there are noncomplement-binding DSAs that are clinically relevant and will not be detected by this assay. One study of 70 renal transplant recipients who developed de novo DSAs found a correlation between C1q positivity and DSA titer and mean fluorescence intensity; however, C1q status was not independently associated with allograft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>It is therefore possible that the increasing sensitivity of DSA testing methods that may identify clinically irrelevant DSA will limit the utility of this screening test in clinically stable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. There is no consensus on when to test for DSA, which is the subject of ongoing prospective studies, particularly in the absence of allograft dysfunction. In one study of 851 renal transplant recipients, systematic monitoring and characterization of DSA posttransplant, which included DSA subclass identification and assessment of C1q-binding capacity, was found to modestly improve prediction and risk stratification of allograft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

In a retrospective analysis of 2079 renal transplant recipients, 302 patients with biopsy-proven acute TCMR or ABMR were reclassified into four different patterns of rejection based upon clinical, histologic, and immunologic phenotypes: T cell-mediated vascular rejection (9 percent), antibody-mediated vascular rejection (21 percent), TCMR without vasculitis (46 percent), and ABMR without vasculitis (24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Of these four patterns, antibody-mediated vascular rejection was previously unrecognized since vascular rejection (defined as the presence of arteritis [ie, v1, v2, or v3 lesion]) was, prior to the Banff 2013 revision, considered as TCMR and not ABMR. At six years posttransplant, patients with antibody-mediated vascular rejection, 45 percent of whom had received a diagnosis of TCMR at the time of biopsy, had the lowest rate of graft survival. In addition, those with antibody-mediated vascular rejection who were treated for acute TCMR had a higher rate of graft loss than those who received treatment for ABMR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3650382607\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic (late) antibody-mediated rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic, active ABMR was first recognized in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] and is now a distinct category in the Banff classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The glomeruli may also be enlarged and show a lobular pattern; segmental or, in severe cases, global sclerosis also may be seen. Electron microscopy may show mesangial cell interposition and subendothelial accumulation of electron-lucent material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58239\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58239 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79914 \">picture 6</a>). Immune complex deposition is generally not a prominent part of transplant glomerulopathy. Other associated histologic features of chronic, active ABMR include multilamination, or multilayering, of the PTC basement membranes, chronic arteriopathy with fibrous intimal thickening, and absence of elastic lamellae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1984116712\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic evaluation of a renal allograft biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute allograft rejection among transplant recipients. However, a number of alternative methods of diagnosis are under investigation. These have the potential to improve the accuracy of diagnosis but still require validation in clinical trials before they can be applied to mainstream clinical practice. A discussion of these investigational methods is presented elsewhere.

Among such patients, it is extremely important to attempt to differentiate BK nephropathy from rejection as the two treatments are diametrically opposed, and increased immunosuppression in the setting of BK nephropathy will lead to further viral proliferation and potential allograft loss. However, distinguishing BK nephropathy from acute rejection on the basis of histology is not always possible, and, in some patients, the two diagnoses may simultaneously overlap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among all patients, special stains for BK should be performed on the biopsy sample if there is concern for BK nephropathy, even in the absence of typical viral inclusions on the biopsy. It is essential that medullary tissue be available for analysis since BK is tropic for medullary tubules more than cortical tubules.

Studies include special stains for T and B cell populations, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens, and monoclonal light chains, as well as quantitative EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum and urine protein electrophoresis.

Some kidneys do not regain function even with maximal antirejection therapy. Even among patients who recover, acute rejection episodes can have a negative impact on long-term graft survival. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute renal allograft rejection is defined as an acute deterioration in allograft function associated with specific pathologic changes in the graft. There are two principal histologic forms of acute rejection, acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection (TCMR) and acute antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). ABMR and acute TCMR may coexist at the same time in the allograft. Subclinical rejection is defined as the presence of histologic evidence of acute rejection on biopsy without an elevation in the serum creatinine concentration. (See <a href=\"#H417236409\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for the development of acute rejection include pre-sensitization (ie, presence of donor-specific antibodies [DSAs] or a high panel reactive antibody [PRA]), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches, pediatric recipient, African-American ethnicity, blood group incompatibility, prolonged cold ischemia time, and delayed graft function (DGF). In addition, patients with a previous episode of rejection, those receiving a second or greater transplant, and those with medication nonadherence are at increased risk for acute rejection. Acute rejection episodes are generally associated with a reduction in long-term allograft survival, although not all rejection episodes have the same impact on long-term graft function. Despite significant reductions in the incidence of acute rejection over the last decade, there has not been a similar improvement in long-term allograft survival. (See <a href=\"#H417236440\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most episodes of acute rejection occur within the first six months after transplantation, with many such episodes occurring early after surgery. Rejection after 12 months is typically from noncompliance or overaggressive reduction in immunosuppression. Most patients who have acute rejection episodes are asymptomatic. However, occasionally, patients present with fever, malaise, oliguria, and graft pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tenderness. Hypertension is also a common finding. (See <a href=\"#H417236515\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute allograft rejection present with an acute rise in the serum creatinine. A rising serum creatinine level, however, is a relatively late development in the course of a rejection episode and usually indicates the presence of significant histologic damage. Pyuria or new or worsening proteinuria may also be present. Most findings obtained by renal imaging are nonspecific, and such studies are generally performed to exclude other causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). (See <a href=\"#H417236522\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H515116843\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute renal allograft rejection should be suspected in patients with one or more of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>New increase in serum creatinine of &ge;25 percent from baseline <strong>or</strong> a serum creatinine that is higher than expected (such as in recently transplanted patients whose serum creatinine stops decreasing earlier than expected after transplantation). However, in patients who are at increased risk for ABMR (eg, highly sensitized patients, recipients of ABO-incompatible renal allografts, patients with DSAs, and patients with inadequate immunosuppression), any incremental increase in serum creatinine should raise the suspicion for the possibility of acute rejection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Worsening hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Proteinuria &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>.

Biopsy of the renal allograft can also reveal other causes of renal inflammation and injury, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, BK nephropathy, interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, de novo or recurrent glomerular disease, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).
