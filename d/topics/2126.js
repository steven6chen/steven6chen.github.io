But try to stay calm. Blood in the urine is not usually serious. Still, it is important to see a doctor or nurse. The medical term for blood in the urine is &quot;hematuria.&quot;</p><p>Blood in the urine can come from the kidneys (where urine is made) or anywhere in the urinary tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739710\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes blood in the urine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood in the urine can be caused by lots of problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder infection, which often also causes burning or pain when you urinate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney infection, which often also causes back pain and fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney stones, which usually also cause back pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain kidney diseases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intense exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury (for example, if you fall off a bike and bruise a kidney)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlargement of the prostate (called &quot;benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;), which is common in older men</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer of the bladder, prostate, or kidney (cancer is an uncommon cause of blood in the urine, and it usually affects people older than 50)</p><p/><p>Sometimes, urine can look as though it is bloody even though it isn't. This can happen if you eat a lot of beets or food dyes, or if you take certain medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739717\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See your doctor or nurse if you see blood in your urine, or if your urine is pink, red, brownish-red, or the color of tea.</p><p>Sometimes, doctors find blood in the urine when they do a routine urine test. That can happen even if the urine looks normal. It means there are microscopic (trace) amounts of blood in the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739724\"><span class=\"h1\">Which tests should I have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation. There are lots of tests, but you might not need any.</p><p>Here are the most common tests doctors use to find the cause of blood in the urine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urine tests</strong> &ndash; Urine tests can show what kind of cells are in the urine. This can hold clues about what might be going wrong.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood tests</strong> &ndash; Blood tests can show whether your kidneys are working normally, or if you might have certain diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CT scan</strong> &ndash; A CT scan is a special kind of X-ray. It creates a picture of the kidneys and urinary tract. Doctors can use it to check for kidney stones and other problems in the urinary tract.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kidney ultrasound</strong> &ndash; A kidney ultrasound is another way to create a picture of the kidneys. Doctors sometimes use ultrasound instead of a CT scan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cystoscopy</strong> &ndash; Cystoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to look inside the bladder. To do a cystoscopy, the doctor inserts a small tube into the urethra, the tube through which urine leaves the body. Then he or she threads the tube up into the bladder. The tube has a tiny camera that projects images of the bladder onto a screen. If the doctor sees anything unusual, he or she might take a sample of tissue (biopsy) to look at under the microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kidney biopsy</strong> &ndash; During a kidney (renal) biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue from the kidney to look at under the microscope. The most common way to get the sample is by inserting a needle straight through the skin in the back and into the kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739731\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what seems to have caused the blood in your urine. If you had blood in your urine because you exercised too intensely or because your kidney was bruised, you might not need any treatment. On the other hand, if you have blood in the urine because of a bladder or kidney infection, you will probably need antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739738\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-enlarged-prostate-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Glomerular disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
