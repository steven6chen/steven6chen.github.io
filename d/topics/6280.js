In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, Garrod was the first to distinguish RA from gout and rheumatic fever. In one study of the period from 1955 to 2007, following four decades (1955 to 1994) of decline, the incidence of RA during the subsequent interval (1995 to 2007) appeared to increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The cause of RA is not known, but many possible etiologies have been identified. Important etiologic clues have been suggested by the identification of unique features of populations with a predilection for RA. As an example, the observation of geographic clustering of the disorder in ancient skeletons implies an important role for environmental factors, which are still poorly defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition to environmental factors, hormonal, genetic, infectious, and other variables also contribute to RA in some manner.</p><p>Multiple different factors probably interact in genetically susceptible hosts to initiate polyarticular synovitis. Once started, the process ultimately becomes self-perpetuating. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors for, and possible causes of rheumatoid arthritis will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis of the synovitis in this disorder, including the roles of T cells, B cells, and cytokines, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The annual incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been reported to be around 40 per 100,000. The disease prevalence is about 1 percent in Caucasians but varies between 0.1 percent (in rural Africans) and 5 percent (in Pima, Blackfeet, and Chippewa Indians) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Women are affected two to three times more often than men.</p><p>RA can occur in patients at any age. The peak onset is between the ages of 50 and 75, and, because of the consistently higher rates in females, the prevalence of RA in females over age 65 is up to 5 percent. In data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, RA was shown to result in significant reductions in employment, productivity, and function with attendant negative economic impact, reflected in its effects upon the gross national product (GNP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The lifetime risk of RA in adults is 3.6 percent (1 in 28) for women and 1.7 percent (1 in 59) for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENDER-SPECIFIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gender-specific factors affect susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in ways that remain incompletely understood. Women are two to three times more likely to develop RA than men, perhaps due in part to the stimulatory effects of estrogen on the immune system. Estrogen inhibits T-suppressor cell function and enhances T-helper cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, estrogen receptors are present on synovial cells and memory T cells, and a receptor polymorphism has been associated with the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Various reproductive factors may contribute to the cause of RA, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of RA is increased by nulliparity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy is often associated with remission of the disease in the last trimester, but postpartum disease flares are common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of RA may be reduced by breastfeeding for one year or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>Maternal-fetal human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations may also interact to affect the manifestations of RA. In one study, women with RA were more likely to experience a remission during pregnancy if there were maternal-fetal disparities in HLA class II antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Such mismatches may produce blocking antibodies to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens that inhibit activation of T cell clones essential for ongoing synovitis.</p><p>Men with RA frequently have lower than normal testosterone levels. This was illustrated in a study of bioavailable testosterone in 104 male RA patients and 99 controls; hypogonadal levels of testosterone were present in a significantly greater proportion of patients (32 versus 7 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Lower levels of the androgenic hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and higher concentrations of estradiol have also been found in men with RA, an effect that is not related to glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is uncertain whether such changes in hormone levels are simply the result of chronic inflammation or whether men with abnormal testosterone and estrogenic hormone levels are at an increased risk of developing RA.</p><p>Male sex also appears to affect disease phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Compared with female RA patients, male patients have significantly later disease onset, are more likely to be rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive, and have higher titers of anti-citrullinated <span class=\"nowrap\">peptide/protein</span> antibodies (ACPA). Male patients are also more likely to have histories of smoking and to possess copies of the shared epitope. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'HLA and non-HLA susceptibility genes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substantial data have emerged about the importance of genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Twin, sibling, and family studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twin and sibling studies implicate genetic factors in the susceptibility for RA. Monozygotic twins have a higher concordance than dizygotic twins for developing RA. In two studies of twins, the concordance for monozygotic twins was 12 to 15 percent versus 3.5 percent for dizygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, the standardized incidence ratio for RA was 3 in offspring of affected parents, 4.6 in siblings, 9.3 in multiplex families, and 1.2 in spouses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, there was an increased frequency of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), scleroderma, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, sarcoid, psoriasis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), asthma, and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) in relatives of patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Other data have shown that sibship concordance rates are consistently higher when probands have severe disease, thereby suggesting that RA may develop when several genetic and environmental factors are present in the same individual. From these and similar data, it has been estimated that genetic factors contribute from 53 to 65 percent of the risk of developing RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, other studies have suggested that genetic factors may contribute less to risk than environmental factors. Among over 65,000 women in the Nurses Health Study the presence of a first-degree relative with RA or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was associated with a significantly increased risk for RA after adjustment for environmental factors (HR 3.59, 95% CI 2.94-4.37), and the risks associated with environmental factors, including smoking, overweight, body mass index, and premenopausal status remained significant after adjusting for familial RA or SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The proportion of risk attributable to the environmental factors collectively was 41 percent, while the risk attributable to the family history (familial <span class=\"nowrap\">RA/SLE)</span> was 21 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">HLA and non-HLA susceptibility genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and other genes to disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment response in RA is discussed in detail separately but will be briefly reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-other-susceptibility-genes-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and other susceptibility genes in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among the growing list of genetic risk factors for RA, significant overlap exists with genes identified as risk factors for other autoimmune diseases, including SLE, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and ankylosing spondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Newly recognized genetic markers associated with RA include an allele of the Fc-gamma receptor, a polymorphism marker in the beta2-adrenergic receptor, and a low-inducible allele of the cytochrome P450 subtype 1A2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Why a given genetic factor can be associated with a variable pattern of organ-system involvement in different disease states is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-autoimmunity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of autoimmunity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The firmest link between a genetic susceptibility factor and RA is the association of the disease with an epitope in the third hypervariable region of the HLA-DR beta-chains, known as the &quot;shared epitope.&quot; Individuals with the sequence leu-glu-lys-arg-ala in residues 67, 70, 71, 72, and 74 have a much higher incidence and prevalence of RA than those who do not have this epitope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This sequence is found in DR4 and DR14 and some DR1 beta-chains. The DR4 beta-chains with the strongest associations with RA are DR-beta*0401, DR-beta*0404, DR-beta*0101, and DR-beta*1402. Although this finding has been demonstrated in many cohorts, such as those of northern European heritage, Israeli Jews, Yakima Indians, and Koreans, it does not appear to apply to all populations. Among African-Americans, for example, other genetic risk factors, many still undefined, appear to contribute significantly to disease susceptibility and severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genetic polymorphisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms are being studied extensively in RA. For example, polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha promoter have been associated with RA, and others have been linked to better therapeutic responses to TNF inhibitors. Statistically significant associations between response to anti-TNF therapy and an RA risk allele at the PTPRC gene locus (also known as CD45) have been found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>An increased risk of RA with single nucleotide polymorphism of the protein tyrosine phosphatase N22 (PTPN22) gene that encodes a phosphatase involved in intracellular T cell signaling has been confirmed in several different populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The same PTPN22 polymorphism may also increase the rate of progression of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. STAT4, which encodes a transcription factor that transmits signals induced by several key cytokines, has been reported to be a risk factor for both RA and systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting a shared pathway for these to autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Additional nucleotide polymorphisms related to T-cell activation and the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF&kappa;B) pathway have also been linked to RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CIGARETTE SMOKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking is a strong risk factor for the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly in individuals with the shared epitope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The magnitude of the overall effect of smoking was evaluated in a retrospective report utilizing data on over 370,000 women from the Women's Health Cohort Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Women who smoked at least 25 cigarettes a day for more than 20 years had a relative risk of 1.4 for developing RA compared with those who had never smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Multivariate analysis revealed that the duration of use, but not the number of cigarettes smoked per day, was significantly associated with increased risk. A similar association with smoking and RA was noted in monozygotic and dizygotic twins discordant for RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and in a prospective population-based study of incident RA in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In addition to increasing disease susceptibility, cigarette smoking may also be a risk factor for greater disease severity. Compared with those who had never smoked, patients with a 25 or more pack-year smoking history are more likely to be seropositive, have nodules, or have radiographically apparent erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>A nationwide case-control study from Denmark evaluated the links between genes, environment, and inflammation in a study of 515 patients with RA and 533 sex- and age-matched population controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In this study, smoking among carriers of the shared epitope was estimated to account for 36 percent of all RA that was associated with anti-citrullinated <span class=\"nowrap\">peptide/protein</span> antibodies (ACPA). The following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who were homozygous for the shared epitope had an elevated risk of ACPA-positive RA but not ACPA-negative RA. The odds ratio (OR) for ACPA-positive RA was 17.8 (95% CI 11-29).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong combined gene-environment effects were observed, with markedly increased risks of ACPA-positive RA among shared epitope homozygotes who were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heavy smokers (OR 53, 95% CI 18-154)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heavy coffee drinkers (OR 53, 95% CI 16-183)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oral contraceptive users (OR 45, 95% CI 15-131)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity has been associated with development of ACPA-negative RA (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7-6.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>The authors of the Danish study concluded that a distinction should be made between RA that is associated with ACPA and that which is not, because these subtypes are likely to represent disease entities with distinct etiologies.</p><p>Smoking cessation may help prevent the development of RA. This was suggested in a population-based study in the United States in which women who had stopped smoking more than ten years before entering the study did not share an increased risk of developing RA with their peers who were actively smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a large Swedish study, smokeless tobacco (eg, moist snuff) did not increase the risk of chronic inflammatory diseases, suggesting that inhaled components of cigarette smoke other than nicotine may be more important than nicotine itself in etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking and the shared epitope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals who are genetically predisposed to RA as a result of carriage of one or more alleles of the shared epitope appear to be at higher risk for developing RA if they also smoke cigarettes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'HLA and non-HLA susceptibility genes'</a> above.)</p><p>In a nationwide study in the United Kingdom of RA-discordant twins, 13 pairs of twins were also discordant for cigarette smoking. Among these twins, the smoker was the twin with RA in 12 of the 13 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A genetic-environmental link was also noted in a retrospective study of 858 Swedish patients with recently diagnosed RA and 1048 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There was a marked increase in risk associated with cigarette smoking. Compared with those who never smoked, the relative risk in current smokers with one or two shared epitopes was 2.3- and 5.6-fold higher, respectively. The relative risk was even higher (5.5 and 15.7) in patients who were rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive.</p><p>The increase in risk associated with smoking in individuals with the shared epitope may be affected primarily by citrullination of proteins in inflamed tissues. This was suggested in a study in which the association between smoking and RA was strongest (relative risk 21) among individuals with antibodies to citrullinated proteins as detected by the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) assay for ACPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In contrast, there was no evidence of an interaction between smoking and the shared epitope in patients who were ACPA-negative, including a subset who were ACPA-negative but RF positive (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Citrullinated proteins and peptides'</a>), nor was an association noted between cigarette smoking, ACPA status, or carriage of shared epitope in a study of 300 African American patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Another study evaluated the genetic-environment-immune link in 515 Danish RA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Of these, 309 had ACPA; of 456 tested, 262 had the shared epitope. The odds ratio (for RA) for those having both the shared epitope and having ACPA was 17.8. For the ACPA-positive, shared epitope-positive RA patients, the odds ratio for those who smoked was 52.6 to 57.4 (versus 17.4 in nonsmokers). For those who consumed alcohol the odds ratio, was 10.5 to 27 (for non-drinkers the odds-ratio was 50.1). The odds ratio for those who drank coffee was 27.4 to 53.3 (versus 13.0 for non-coffee drinkers). The odds ratio for women who used oral contraceptives was 44.6 (versus 32.3 for non-users). Furthermore, the odds ratio for ACPA-positive, shared epitope homozygous patients who were unmarried was 177 and was 243 for those without a job. The authors concluded that smoking among carriers of the shared epitope (either heterozygotes or homozygotes) accounted for 36 percent of all ACPA-positive RA patients.</p><p>As mentioned above, some have interpreted these data to indicate that the shared epitope is a marker for ACPA rather than an independent risk factor for RA per se. Peptidyl arginase deiminase (PADI) is the enzyme that modifies arginine residues to citrulline. One haplotype in the PADI 4 gene leads to increased levels of the enzyme and susceptibility to RA in some Asian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a study from Korea of 341 RA patients, PADI 4 haplotypes were associated with &quot;seropositive&quot; (eg, ACPA-positive) RA of short disease duration, while the shared epitope was associated with longstanding, seropositive RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In addition to the shared epitope, there may be other genetic components that predispose to the development of more severe disease in smokers. Among a group of 96 mostly Caucasian women with RA, 30 were homozygous for a nonfunctional allele at the M1 locus for the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Posttraumatic stress disorder may also increase the risk of RA, consistent with other evidence of the association between stress and physical disorders, particularly autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Atopic dermatitis has also been associated with an increased the risk of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. High consumption of red meat does not increase the risk for developing RA, and the evidence for roles of vitamin D and oral contraceptives remains equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The annual incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is approximately 40 per 100,000, and the prevalence is about 1 percent in Caucasians but differs in other populations. Women are affected two to three times more often than men. RA can occur in patients at any age, and the peak onset is between the ages of 50 and 75. The lifetime risk of RA in adults is 3.6 percent (1 in 28) for women and 1.7 percent (1 in 59) for men. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender-specific factors affect susceptibility to RA in ways that remain incompletely understood. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Gender-specific factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substantial data have emerged about the importance of genetic risk factors for RA from studies of twins and siblings, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA susceptibility genes, and other polymorphisms. The firmest link between a genetic susceptibility factor and RA is the association of the disease with an epitope in the third hypervariable region of the HLA-DR beta-chains, known as the &quot;shared epitope.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetic susceptibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoking is a strong risk factor for the development of RA, particularly in individuals with the shared epitope. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cigarette smoking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A role for viral or bacterial infection as an inciting trigger for RA has been hypothesized, but no single agent has been proven responsible. Some studies implicate a role for toll-like receptors, the inflammasome, and responses to superantigens in linking infection and the autoimmune arthritis process. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Possible role of infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Superantigens and heat shock proteins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with significant rheumatoid factor (RF) titers have a greater likelihood of extraarticular disease than do seronegative patients, although RF alone does not cause RA. RF and anti-citrullinated <span class=\"nowrap\">peptide/protein</span> antibodies (ACPA) may be present in the blood prior to the appearance of arthritis, and the combination of ACPA with the genetic markers, the shared epitope, and PTPN22 greatly increases the risk for the development of RA. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Autoantibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various occupational and other exposures as well as environmental and other factors have been associated with modifying the risk for the development of RA. Obesity is associated with increased risk of RA, while mild to moderate alcohol use may reduce risk. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Occupational exposures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Other risk modifiers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063527660\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Peter Schur, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rothschild BM, Turner KR, DeLuca MA.
