This may manifest as excessive napping, inappropriate daytime sleep, or even accidents caused by falling asleep while driving or during other activities. In many cases, EDS is due to a treatable medical disorder, and proper diagnosis and treatment offers the possibility of improved daytime sleepiness along with improved medical outcomes.</p><p>This topic reviews medical and neurologic disorders associated with problematic sleepiness, beyond primary sleep disorders. An approach to the initial evaluation and management of a patient with EDS is presented separately. The evaluation and management of persistent sleepiness in patients with a known diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is also reviewed separately.

EDS is separate from mental and physical fatigue, which can be manifested as difficulty or inability initiating activity, reduced capacity maintaining activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficulty with concentration and memory. Terms may be used interchangeably by patients, however, and it is not always possible to distinguish them by history alone.</p><p>In patients with sleep disorders, fatigue and sleepiness measures are correlated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinically, fatigue may be worse after positional change or exercise, but EDS may be briefly improved. A patient with sleepiness may fall asleep when sedentary, but a patient with fatigue may not be able to initiate sleep when at rest.</p><p>In the author's experience, sleep disorders often contribute to sleepiness and may also contribute to fatigue. Therefore, efforts to identify and treat underlying sleep disorders are warranted as they may alleviate symptoms regardless of label [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Neuroimaging is unnecessary in most patients with sleepiness, but it should be considered in those with new or unexplained focal neurologic deficits on examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke &ndash; Sleepiness and fatigue are common after stroke and may be associated with poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One important secondary cause is sleep apnea, which is identified in approximately 60 percent of stroke survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Clinical features and questionnaires, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, lack sensitivity in patients with stroke, and diagnosis requires formal sleep testing with in-laboratory polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea has the potential to improve stroke rehabilitation outcomes as well as aid in secondary prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related breathing disorders and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">EDS is occasionally a direct result of stroke. In such cases, symptoms are typically acute in onset and accompanied by focal neurologic signs. Side effects from medications are another potential cause of sleepiness after acute stroke. Sedating medications have been associated with poor stroke recovery and should be avoided if possible in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors &ndash; Tumors that damage the hypothalamus or midbrain can cause EDS directly by damaging wake-promoting systems or indirectly via secondary hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure, which effectively produces bilateral dysfunction of the cortex or midline structures. Tumors in these regions often produce abnormal eye movements, hemiparesis, or pituitary dysfunction, and nearly all of these lesions increase the total daily amount of sleep. Morning headaches can occur with brain tumors, although this pattern is nonspecific and can also be seen with other more common causes of sleepiness, such as obstructive sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic brain injury &ndash; EDS is a prominent symptom after traumatic brain injury, reported by 50 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Traumatic brain injury can acutely reduce orexin (hypocretin) levels in the spinal fluid, though levels usually recover later. Severe traumatic brain injury can also injure hypothalamic neurons that produce histamine, a key wake-promoting neurotransmitter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury#H962417\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-wake disorders in patients with traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Symptom spectrum'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple sclerosis &ndash; Midline structures containing the projecting aminergic and cholinergic systems are particularly vulnerable to damage in patients with multiple sclerosis, and demyelination in these areas as well as inflammation more generally may result in EDS. Antibodies to aquaporin-4 and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may produce sleepiness through a similar mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with multiple sclerosis are also at increased risk for a variety of sleep disorders, including restless legs syndrome (RLS) and obstructive sleep apnea, which may contribute to sleepiness. Side effects from medications are another important consideration. One study of 190 patients with multiple sclerosis found that 47 percent used a sedative hypnotic agent, which could have been contributing to fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Patients with neurologic sarcoidosis usually, but not always, have evidence of systemic disease on chest radiography or computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with gadolinium most commonly demonstrates meningeal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parenchymal enhancement in affected areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H878898020\"><span class=\"h2\">Epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epilepsy and sleep are highly interrelated. Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality can precipitate seizures, whereas poor seizure control can disrupt sleep and lead to EDS. One study of 100 patients with epilepsy noted that patients with nocturnal seizure patterns tended to have more daytime sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with poorly controlled epilepsy are also more likely to be on a variety of antiseizure drugs, many of which induce sleepiness from direct central nervous system effects or indirectly by inducing sleep apnea via relaxation of the upper airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The EDS in early Parkinson disease progresses over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Pathologic studies have demonstrated some loss of the orexin-producing neurons in advanced stages of the disease, although this is probably not the main cause of EDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Efforts should be made to address the underlying medical disorder and maximize symptomatic management.</p><p>While most of the medical disorders reviewed above will be apparent by history, physical examination, and basic blood work (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H1822286\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>), additional tests may be warranted in selected patients. Examples include lactate and pyruvate for suspected mitochondrial disorders, serum ammonia to rule out hyperammonemia, endocrine testing, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A history of restless legs or periodic limb movements during sleep should prompt measurement of serum ferritin, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Blood and urine toxicology screens should be considered when there are few clues to the source of symptoms or in the presence of drug-seeking behaviors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast may be indicated when there are focal neurologic signs or suspicion for an inflammatory neurologic process. (See <a href=\"#H667836989\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3991184751\" class=\"local\">'Medical conditions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H453450919\" class=\"local\">'Substance abuse'</a> above.)</p><p>Recognition and treatment of comorbid sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are paramount (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811 \">table 3</a>). In particular, obstructive sleep apnea is common, frequently undiagnosed, and often inadequately treated due to poor adherence to positive airway pressure therapy. Polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing is required to make a diagnosis of sleep apnea and to confirm adequate response to therapy. The role of polysomnography, the multiple sleep latency test, and other additional testing in the initial evaluation of sleepiness is reviewed separately.

In cases of uncertainty, actigraphy may be a useful adjunct to sleep logs to help quantify sleep and detect unrecognized circadian and sleep disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insufficient-sleep-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insufficient sleep: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Elimination of sedating medications is helpful if possible.

(See <a href=\"#H1314068458\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p>Behavioral strategies include more light exposure in the daytime, which can improve alertness. Physical activity or even position changes (eg, standing instead of sitting) can also increase alertness during monotonous tasks or situations.</p><p>If sleepiness persists despite optimal treatment of the underlying medical disorder, then a wake-promoting medication can be considered. There are no established pharmacologic therapies for symptomatic management of sleepiness in this setting.
