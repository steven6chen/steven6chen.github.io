Doctors use the word &quot;acute&quot; when something starts suddenly. The &quot;abdomen,&quot; or belly, is the part of the body between the chest and the genital area.</p><p>When people have an acute abdomen, their pain is so severe that they have a hard time moving or breathing and it makes them want to go to the hospital or see their doctor or nurse right away. A true acute abdomen is a medical emergency.</p><p>The pain symptoms are different for different people. The pain can feel sharp or crampy. People can feel the pain all over their belly, or only in 1 part. Some people feel better if they curl into a ball, while others need to lie flat and completely still. People often feel sick to their stomach and retch or vomit.</p><p>Of course, not everyone with pain in the belly has an acute abdomen. When pain is less severe, it can be due to something like a virus or a stomach inflammation (called &quot;gastritis&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8006055\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes an acute abdomen?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute abdomen can have different causes. Most of the time, an acute abdomen happens when there's a serious problem with 1 or more organs in the abdomen. Organs in the abdomen can be part of the digestive, urinary, or female reproductive systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Conditions that affect organs in the chest or genital area can also cause an acute abdomen. Even though these organs aren't in the belly, people might still have pain in their belly.</p><p>Common causes of an acute abdomen in adults include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appendicitis &ndash; Appendicitis is the term for when the appendix (a long, thin pouch that hangs down from the large intestine) gets infected and inflamed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diverticulitis &ndash; Diverticulitis is an infection that develops in small pouches that can form in the intestine. This is common in older people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallstones &ndash; Gallstones are small stones that form inside an organ called the gallbladder, which stores bile, a fluid that helps the body break down fat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abscess &ndash; An abscess is a collection of pus in the intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel perforation &ndash; This is a hole in the bowel wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perforated ulcer &ndash; This is a hole in the wall of the stomach or intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatitis &ndash; This is the term for when the pancreas gets inflamed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ruptured cyst in the ovary &ndash; Cysts in the ovary are fluid-filled sacs that can form in some women. They sometimes rupture, which means that they break open and spill out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ectopic pregnancy &ndash; An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8006070\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of acute abdomen, see your doctor or nurse or go to the hospital right away. If you have a true acute abdomen, it is important that treatment begin without delay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8006085\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. The doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, including where your pain is and what it feels like. He or she will ask about your current and past medical conditions, and do an exam. Your doctor might do repeat exams over time to follow your symptoms.</p><p>Your doctor will decide which tests you should have based on your symptoms and individual situation. The tests might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ultrasound, CT scan, or other imaging test &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8006100\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an acute abdomen treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what's causing the pain. It might include 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids given by IV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic medicines to treat an infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines to treat other medical conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8006115\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomach-ache-and-stomach-upset-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stomach ache and stomach upset (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=appendicitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Appendicitis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-bowel-obstruction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Small bowel obstruction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ectopic pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Endometriosis (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
