Many of these infants presented with hives and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this study and in another large study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], infants were less likely to have blood pressure documented during their emergency department stay than were older children.</p><p>Tryptase measurements are less helpful in infants with anaphylaxis than in older patients. Tryptase levels are typically within normal limits in patients of all ages with anaphylaxis triggered by food and in those who remain normotensive. Food is by far the most common trigger of anaphylaxis in infancy. The normal range of serum tryptase levels in a pediatric population ranging in age from six months to 18 years is comparable with the normal range reported in the adult population. The normal reference range for baseline tryptase concentrations in early infancy differs from the normal reference range in older infants, children, and adults. In nonatopic infants under age three months, the median baseline tryptase concentration is 6.1&plusmn;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L;</span> in atopic infants under age three months, it is 14.3&plusmn;10.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span>.

His lips and cheeks became swollen, and his eyes swelled shut. He vomited twice. Initially, he was irritable. Later, he became sleepy.</p><p>He was taken immediately to the nearest emergency department. On arrival, he was noted to have generalized hives, periorbital swelling, tachypnea, and wheezing. His oxygen saturation was 92 percent in room air. He was treated with supplemental oxygen by facemask and an intramuscular injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> 0.1 mg of a 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> (1:1000) solution. The epinephrine injection was repeated 15 minutes later. He was then transferred to a children's hospital. On arrival there, three hours after his symptoms began, he was lethargic and had a fading, raised, red rash superimposed on scaly red areas on his face, trunk, and extremities.</p><p>The clinical diagnoses were (1) anaphylaxis and (2) <span class=\"nowrap\">eczema/atopic</span> dermatitis.</p><p>Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were highly positive (10 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> to egg white but absent or undetectable to cow's milk and rice. Six weeks later, skin prick tests were positive to egg white but negative to cow's milk and rice. No other food allergens were tested.</p><p>Long-term risk reduction measures were implemented. His parents were given verbal and written instructions about how to avoid feeding him egg in any form. These instructions included a list of foods that commonly contain egg (eg, ice cream, pudding) and how to check the ingredient labels on processed foods and packaged foods for words that might indicate egg (eg, albumin, ovalbumin, lecithin; <a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/file/tips-avoid-allergen.pdf&amp;token=oN6rXOmeBLkIpfIsq5mH5Vubaw4fI+8XYYiBro3ggBQ5hJlAba9Lqx6Ggg3lDfTyNE3jlOaI+lgbIsX7Coa/Rw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5750\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Food Allergy Research and Education [FARE]</a> and <a href=\"https://web.emmes.com/study/cofar/EGGAvoidance.pdf&amp;token=61D79h4FlocEgxiAXo/xoo0cl6Je4x6DO0xHKKODzLFeoIH77SM8pgqpzFAPB95QLnW37a7670H/X2cCPrO26Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5750\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Consortium of Food Allergy Research [CoFAR] sheet on egg</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A personalized written anaphylaxis emergency action plan was developed for him [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An autoinjector containing 0.15 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> was prescribed, despite the awareness that this dose is not ideal for a 10 kg infant, because it exceeds 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> the recommended pediatric epinephrine dose for intramuscular injection. His parents were instructed on when and how to use an epinephrine autoinjector and referred to the relevant website for a review of these instructions. A cloth Medic-Alert bracelet stating &quot;anaphylaxis to egg&quot; was recommended because he attended a childcare center three days a week.

Vaccines to prevent infectious disease rarely trigger anaphylaxis in patients of any age, including infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Infants with nonimmune triggers such as cold air or cold water exposure, those with multiple anaphylaxis triggers from different classes of agents (eg, food, medication), and those without an identifiable anaphylaxis trigger (idiopathic anaphylaxis) should have a careful skin examination for cutaneous mastocytosis lesions and measurement of a baseline tryptase level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

As an example, in a prospective, observational study, advice and written instructions were provided to families of 512 infants with milk or egg allergy aged 3 to 15 months at study entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Despite this education, allergic reactions occurred in 53 percent of the infants. Reactions were associated not only with misreading food labels or food cross-contamination but were also due to intentional exposure of infants to foods that should not have been given to them and infants being fed by persons other than their parents.</p><p>However, any food can trigger anaphylaxis in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/7,9,20,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,20,22-26</a>]. This includes foods often presumed to be harmless (eg, goat's milk, sheep's milk, hypoallergenic formula cross-contaminated with cow's milk, probiotics contaminated with cow's milk), foods infrequently given to infants (eg, sesame), and foods eaten by indigenous peoples (eg, seal meat and whale meat eaten by indigenous people in circumpolar regions).</p><p>Infants can be sensitized to foods in utero, through breast milk, through direct ingestion of the food, or through accidental exposure (eg, food encountered and put in the mouth by crawling infant or food given to the infant by an older sibling or caregiver) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/7-9,20,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,20,22-26</a>]. Skin contact with food, including skin care products containing foods, or inhalation of aerosolized food particles can potentially sensitize an infant (ie, lead to production of food-specific immunoglobulin E [IgE]) but rarely trigger anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-in-infants/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>].

This can be stressful for caregivers, especially if the implicated allergen is a food such as egg, cow's milk, or peanut that is ubiquitous in the diet and is commonly found in prepackaged or processed foods.

Diagnosis therefore depends upon a high index of suspicion and meticulous history of antecedent exposures and events, chronologic development of symptoms, and careful physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H22500599\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food is the most common trigger of anaphylaxis in infants.

Some conditions in the differential diagnosis, such as food protein-induced enterocolitis and apparent life-threatening events, are age unique.
