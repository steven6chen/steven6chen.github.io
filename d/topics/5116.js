This also increases insulin responsiveness by lowering the plasma osmolality (Posm), reducing vasoconstriction and improving perfusion, and reducing stress hormone levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The next step is correction of the potassium deficit. The choice of fluid replacement should be influenced by the potassium deficit. The osmotic effect of potassium repletion must be considered since potassium is as osmotically active as sodium. (See <a href=\"#H10738776\" class=\"local\">'Potassium replacement'</a> below.)</p><p>Low-dose intravenous (IV) insulin should be administered to all patients with moderate to severe DKA who have a serum potassium &ge;3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. If the serum potassium is less than 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> insulin therapy should be delayed until potassium replacement has begun and the serum potassium concentration has increased. The delay is necessary because insulin will worsen the hypokalemia by driving potassium into the cells, and this could trigger cardiac arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous regular insulin'</a> below.)</p><p>Therapy requires frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring and the identification and treatment of any precipitating events, including infection. SGLT2 inhibitors, which can precipitate DKA, should be discontinued.

The optimal rate of isotonic saline infusion is dependent upon the clinical state of the patient. Isotonic saline should be infused as quickly as possible in patients with hypovolemic shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In hypovolemic patients without shock (and without heart failure), isotonic saline is infused at a rate of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> lean body weight per hour (approximately 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> in an average-sized person), for the first couple hours, with a maximum of &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> in the first four hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61747\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61747 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67368\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67368 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>After the second or third hour, optimal fluid replacement depends upon the state of hydration, serum electrolyte levels, and the urine output.

Potassium repletion affects the saline solution that is given since potassium is as osmotically active as sodium. Thus, concurrent potassium replacement may be another indication for the use of one-half isotonic saline. (See <a href=\"#H10738776\" class=\"local\">'Potassium replacement'</a> below.)</p><p>We add dextrose to the saline solution when the serum glucose reaches 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in DKA or 250 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 to 16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in HHS. Patients with euglycemic DKA generally require both insulin and glucose to treat the ketoacidosis and prevent hypoglycemia, respectively, and in such patients, dextrose is added to IV fluids at the initiation of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous regular insulin'</a> below.)</p><p>Adequate rehydration with correction of the hyperosmolar state may enhance the response to low-dose insulin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Adequacy of fluid replacement is judged by frequent hemodynamic and laboratory monitoring (see <a href=\"#H23160657\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below). In patients with abnormal renal or cardiac function, more frequent monitoring must be performed to avoid iatrogenic fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment/abstract/8,9,11,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11,14-17</a>]. The goal is to correct estimated deficits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76060 \">table 2</a>) within the first 24 hours. However, osmolality should not be reduced too rapidly, because this may generate cerebral edema.

The choice of replacement fluid (isotonic or one-half isotonic saline) depends upon the state of hydration, corrected sodium concentration, dose of KCl, blood pressure, and a clinical assessment of overall volume status. Patients with marked hypokalemia require aggressive potassium replacement (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/hour,</span> with additional supplementation based upon hourly serum potassium measurements) to raise the serum potassium concentration into the normal range of 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial serum potassium is between 3.3 and 5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> IV KCl (20 to 30 mEq) is added to each liter of IV replacement fluid and continued until the serum potassium concentration has increased to the 4.0 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial serum potassium concentration is greater than 5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> then potassium replacement should be delayed until its concentration has fallen below this level.</p><p/><p>Potassium salts added to IV fluids have the same osmotic effect as sodium salts, and this should be considered when determining the potential impact of IV fluid infusion on osmolality. As an example, 40 mEq of KCl added to 1 L of fluid generates 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsmol/L</span> of electrolyte osmolality. The addition of 40 mEq of potassium to 1 L of one-half isotonic saline creates a solution with an osmolality of 234 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsmol/L</span> (77 mEq NaCl and 40 mEq KCl), which is osmotically equal to three-quarters isotonic saline. (The osmolality of isotonic saline is 308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsmol/L</span>.) If 40 mEq of KCl is added to isotonic saline, the final osmolality will be approximately 388 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsmol/L</span>. However, KCL will not have the same extracellular fluid (ECF) expansion effect as NaCl, because most of the potassium will shift into cells very rapidly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Choice of replacement fluid'</a>.)</p><p>Almost all patients with DKA or HHS have a substantial potassium deficit, usually due to urinary losses generated by the glucose osmotic diuresis and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Despite the total body potassium deficit, the serum potassium concentration is usually normal or, in approximately one-third of cases, elevated at presentation. This is largely due to insulin deficiency and hyperosmolality, each of which cause potassium movement out of the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The altered potassium distribution is rapidly reversed with the administration of insulin and can result in an often dramatic fall in the serum potassium concentration, despite potassium replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. However, potassium replacement must be done cautiously if renal function remains depressed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine output does not increase to a level &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>.

The choice of IV insulin is based upon institutional preferences, clinician experience, and cost concerns. We generally prefer regular insulin, rather than rapid-acting insulin analogs, due to its much lower cost.

Inhibition of lipolysis requires a much lower level of insulin than that required to reduce the serum glucose concentration.

Frequent monitoring is essential, and underlying precipitating events should be identified and corrected. (See <a href=\"#H4565776\" class=\"local\">'Overview and protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend vigorous intravenous (IV) fluid replacement to correct both hypovolemia and hyperosmolality (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Fluid replacement should correct estimated deficits within the first 24 hours, with care to avoid an overly rapid reduction in the serum osmolality. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Fluid replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Isotonic saline should be infused as quickly as possible in patients with hypovolemic shock. In hypovolemic patients without shock (and without heart failure), we begin with isotonic (0.9 percent) saline infused at a rate of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour (approximately 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> in an average-sized person) for the first couple hours. This is followed by one-half isotonic (0.45 percent) saline at a rate of approximately 250 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> if the serum sodium is normal or elevated; isotonic saline is continued at a rate of approximately 250 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> if hyponatremia is present. We add dextrose to the saline solution when the serum glucose reaches 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in DKA or 250 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 to 16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in HHS. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Fluid replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The need for potassium repletion may influence the timing of one-half isotonic saline therapy since the addition of potassium to isotonic saline creates a hypertonic solution that can worsen the underlying hyperosmolality. (See <a href=\"#H10738776\" class=\"local\">'Potassium replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with DKA or HHS typically have a marked degree of potassium depletion due to both renal and, in some patients, gastrointestinal losses. However, because of potassium redistribution from the cells into the extracellular fluid (ECF), the initial serum potassium concentration is often normal or elevated, an effect that will be reversed by insulin therapy. We recommend that replacement with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> (KCl) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>) be initiated when the serum potassium concentration is &le;5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Patients with an initial serum potassium below 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> should receive aggressive fluid and potassium replacement prior to treatment with insulin to prevent initial worsening of the hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"#H10738776\" class=\"local\">'Potassium replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend initial treatment with low-dose IV insulin in all patients with moderate to severe DKA or HHS who have a serum potassium &ge;3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Patients with an initial serum potassium below 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> should receive aggressive fluid and potassium replacement <strong>prior</strong> to treatment with insulin. (See <a href=\"#H10738776\" class=\"local\">'Potassium replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The insulin regimen is the same in DKA and HHS. If the serum potassium is &ge;3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> we give a continuous IV infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> at 0.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour; at this dose, an initial IV bolus is not necessary. An alternative option is to administer an IV bolus (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> body weight) of regular insulin, followed by a continuous infusion at a dose of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour. The dose is doubled if the glucose does not fall by 50 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in the first hour. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Insulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A cost-effective alternative to IV insulin in the initial treatment of uncomplicated DKA is the use of subcutaneous, rapid-acting insulin analogs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a>, aspart, and glulisine) in selected patients in settings in which adequate monitoring can be assured. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to the intravenous route for insulin treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> therapy to help correct the metabolic acidosis are controversial. We suggest treatment with IV sodium bicarbonate in patients with an arterial pH less than 6.9 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Bicarbonate and metabolic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although whole-body phosphate depletion is usually present, we recommend <strong>not</strong> administering phosphate routinely (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We suggest phosphate replacement for patients with severe hypophosphatemia (&lt;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> respiratory or cardiac failure, or hemolytic anemia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Phosphate depletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring involves hourly glucose measurement until stable, and basic chemistry profile and venous pH (for DKA) every two to four hours. The course of ketoacidemia can be assessed by direct measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate, the major circulating ketoacid, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> measurement of the serum anion gap. In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> tablets or reagent sticks should not be used, because they react with acetoacetate and acetone but not with beta-hydroxybutyrate. Acetone is biochemically neutral and does not contribute to the ketoacidosis. (See <a href=\"#H23160657\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We initiate a multiple-dose, subcutaneous insulin schedule when the ketoacidosis has resolved and the patient is able to eat. For patients with HHS, IV insulin infusion can be tapered and a multiple-dose, subcutaneous insulin schedule started when the serum glucose falls below 250 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 to 16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The IV insulin infusion should be continued for one to two hours after initiating the subcutaneous insulin to avoid recurrence of hyperglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H4566002\" class=\"local\">'Converting to subcutaneous insulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral edema is rare in adults but is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Possible preventive measures in high-risk patients include gradual rather than rapid correction of fluid and sodium deficits (maximum reduction in plasma osmolality (Posm) of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsmol/kg</span> per hour), and maintenance of a slightly elevated serum glucose until the patient is stable. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral edema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3920112941\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Abbas Kitabchi, PhD, MD, FACP, MACE, who passed away in July 2016.
