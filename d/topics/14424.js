The mortality rate ranged from 5.1 percent for combined ambulatory and hospitalized patients (data were not reported for ambulatory patients alone) to 13.6 percent in hospitalized patients to 36.5 percent in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p><p>Outcomes of patients with CAP were also evaluated in the prospective, multicenter observational Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) study of 944 outpatients and 1343 inpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The following findings were noted at 30 days after presentation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among outpatients, there were six deaths (0.6 percent), three of which were related to pneumonia. In addition, 76 percent of patients reported at least one residual symptom (most often fatigue) compared with 45 percent by history in the month before the onset of CAP. However, most had resumed usual activities within seven days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the outpatient setting&quot;, section on 'Treatment duration and response'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among inpatients, the mortality rate was 8 percent, 76 percent of which were attributed to pneumonia; most deaths occurred during hospitalization. After hospital discharge, 87 percent had at least one residual symptom at 30 days compared with 65 percent by history in the month before the onset of CAP. Return to normal activities occurred at a median of 24 days for those not employed and 15 days for those employed who returned to work at a median of 22 days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults who require hospitalization&quot;, section on 'Clinical response to therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In a study of over 2 million cases of CAP between 1987 and 2005 in patients &ge;65 years of age in the United States that were detected through a review of Medicare claims, the age- and sex-adjusted 30-day mortality rate decreased from 13.5 percent to 9.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. After adjustment for comorbidities, there was an even larger reduction in the risk of mortality between 1987 and 2006 (adjusted odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.44-0.47).</p><p>In contrast, in a subsequent study using data from the United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample (the largest all-payer, publically available national hospital database) between 2003 and 2009, when a primary diagnosis of pneumonia was combined with a primary diagnosis of sepsis or respiratory failure associated with a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia, age- and sex-adjusted inpatient mortality rate increased slightly from 8.3 to 8.8 percent (absolute risk increase 0.5 percent, 9% CI 0.1-0.9%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, when only the primary diagnosis of pneumonia was assessed, there was a significant decrease in inpatient mortality rate from 5.8 to 4.2 percent (absolute risk reduction 1.6 percent, 95% CI 1.4-1.9%). Notably, over the same time period, there was an increase in the primary diagnosis of sepsis with pneumonia as a secondary diagnosis that counterbalanced the apparent decrease in mortality from pneumonia. These results suggest that a temporal change in diagnostic coding affects longitudinal outcome results in studies that use administrative data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services database estimate the 30-day mortality rate of CAP patients (mostly &gt;65 years of age) requiring admission in the United States to be approximately 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The above mortality rates represent overall values. Factors at presentation can be used to stratify patients into those at low risk who can usually be treated as outpatients and patients at higher risk who require hospitalization or even direct admission to an ICU.

Overall, 2561 patients (12.1 percent) died within 30 days of admission. Among these, 1343 (52.4 percent) died during the hospital stay and 1218 (47.6 percent) died after discharge. On multivariate analysis, seven factors were associated with death prior to discharge, including systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, respiratory rate &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute,</span> bacteremia, arterial pH &lt;7.35, blood urea nitrogen &gt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> arterial PO<sub>2</sub> &lt;60 mmHg or arterial oxygen saturation &lt;90 percent, and need for mechanical ventilation. Comorbidities were equally associated with death in the hospital and death after discharge.</p><p>In a prospective study of 1284 patients discharged from a tertiary hospital after treatment for CAP, 7.2 percent died within one year of discharge, with most of the deaths occurring within the first six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The major causes of death were infection (mostly pneumonia) and acute cardiovascular events. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, dementia, rehospitalization within 30 days of hospital discharge, and residence in a long-term care facility were independently associated with one-year mortality. The incidence of long-term mortality increased &gt;50 percent when four or more risk factors were present.</p><p>The impact of timing of antimicrobial initiation on outcomes is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization#H2573069467\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults who require hospitalization&quot;, section on 'Timing of antimicrobial initiation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H371246805\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term outcomes for both respiratory status and quality-of-life status were assessed in a study of 102 patients with mild to moderate-severe CAP requiring hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Well-being generally returned to pre-pneumonia status within six months; persistent respiratory symptoms beyond 28 days were more likely to reflect age or comorbidity than the effect of pneumonia.</p><p>CAP influences long-term survival of patients who were admitted to the hospital and subsequently discharged; the effect of CAP persists for a long period after discharge. In one study, one of three patients &gt;65 years of age who survived hospitalization for CAP died in the following year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study of Veterans Administration patients with a mean age of 69.9 years, those who were discharged from the hospital after treatment for CAP had a significantly shorter duration of survival compared with patients discharged for non-pneumonia diagnoses; among patients with CAP, there was a 50 percent mortality rate at 34 months compared with 84 months among patients without CAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a large, population-based cohort study, patients with CAP had an excess risk of death for up to 10 years compared with a matched control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In a population-based cohort study of 271 CAP patients requiring ICU admission, the 30-day mortality was 11 percent, but the one-year mortality one was 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dependent functional status correlated strongly with both short- and long-term mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have evaluated the impact of guidelines on the outcome of CAP, although none were designed to compare specific antibiotic regimens in different guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/17-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-29</a>]. Most found a benefit to guideline-directed care, although the types of benefit (requirement of admission, duration of hospitalization, mortality, and cost) varied among the studies. All of the studies were performed before the availability of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">America/American</span> Thoracic Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(IDSA/ATS)</span> consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Perhaps the best data come from a multicenter controlled trial using cluster randomization in 1743 patients with CAP who presented to the emergency department in 19 hospitals; the trial compared conventional care with the use of a critical pathway algorithm for hospitalization and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The care pathway included therapy with intravenous and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>; in comparison, levofloxacin was not available to physicians in the conventional treatment hospitals.</p><p>Patients treated according to the algorithm had significant reductions in the number of bed days per patient admitted (4.4 versus 6.1 days) and in the proportion of low-risk patients who were admitted (31 versus 49 percent). Although inpatients at critical pathway hospitals had more severe disease, they required significantly fewer days of intravenous therapy and were more likely to be treated with a single class of antibiotic. These reductions in the use of hospital resources were not associated with any adverse clinical effects, as complications, readmission, mortality, and quality of life were not different between the two groups.</p><p>An important limitation to observational data in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/18-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-27</a>] is that guideline adherence could represent a surrogate marker for other aspects of clinical care rather than being directly responsible for the improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Nevertheless, the available data support a probable benefit from guideline adherence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTORS OF MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several groups in the United States and Britain have explored factors that predict mortality in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/4,30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,30-36</a>].

As an example of the impact of increased age, in a study that included 1349 patients &ge;65 years of age, the 30-day mortality rate was 5, 11, and 24 percent in patients 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and &ge;85 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Among severely ill patients, late ICU admission (day 2 or later) was associated with higher 30-day mortality than ICU admission within 24 hours of presentation (47 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective cohort study of over one million Medicare beneficiaries (aged &gt;64 years) admitted to hospitals in the United States with pneumonia, ICU admission for patients with disease of marginal severity was associated with improved survival and no difference in costs compared with general ward admission, suggesting that ICU admission may benefit such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In adjusted analyses, for the 13 percent of patients whose admission appeared to be discretionary (dependent only on distance), ICU admission was associated with a significantly lower adjusted 30-day mortality than patients admitted to a general ward (14.8 versus 20.5 percent). These results suggest a potential benefit of using broader ICU admission criteria but should be confirmed in a randomized trial.</p><p>Among nondiabetics with CAP, an elevated serum glucose concentration at hospital admission was a predictor of death at 28 and 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].
