In developed countries, the most common valve lesions are aortic stenosis (AS) due to calcific disease (affecting a trileaflet or bicuspid valve), and mitral regurgitation (MR) due to primary causes that include degenerative disease or secondary functional causes such as chronic ischemic MR or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108930\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108930 \">figure 1</a>).

An intra-arterial catheter is inserted before anesthetic induction and a large-bore central venous catheter (CVC) is inserted before or after induction. Point-of-care testing (POCT) of laboratory values and brain monitoring with processed electroencephalography (EEG) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) cerebral oximetry are also employed in many institutions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery#H1601071000\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>In selected patients with impaired left or right ventricular function or documented preoperative pulmonary hypertension, a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) may be inserted to monitor perioperative pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), cardiac output (CO), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (S<sub>V</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Some centers preemptively place an atrioventricular (AV) pacing system via the CVC or use a PAC with pacing capability in patients at increased risk of developing heart block or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) if loss of AV synchrony is likely to result in profound hypotension, or for those who require precise control of heart rate to provide optimal CO. </p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Defibrillator/pacing</span> pads may be placed on the patient and the defibrillator monitor and function are checked before anesthetic induction, so that cardioversion, defibrillation, or pacing can be rapidly accomplished if necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F115417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115417 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H398104034\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of transesophageal echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most institutions, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used to confirm and characterize cardiac valve pathology, monitor air removal after open cardiotomy, and assess the adequacy of the repaired or replaced valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Other aspects of a standard TEE examination and use of TEE for continuous monitoring of intravascular volume status and biventricular function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery#H2783832566\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery&quot;, section on 'Transesophageal echocardiography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery#H2703433221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery&quot;, section on 'Postbypass transesophageal echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1204912592\"><span class=\"h3\">Prebypass period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial probe insertion, TEE examination allows confirmation of the preoperative diagnoses and refinement of the operative plan (eg, valve repair versus replacement). Notably, the anesthesiologist's intraoperative assessment of the severity of cardiac valve stenosis or regurgitation may differ from preoperative assessments due to hemodynamic changes that occur with induction of general anesthesia (eg, reduced blood pressure [BP] decreases severity of aortic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mitral regurgitation, while reduced CO decreases the gradients across the aortic and mitral valves) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium (LA) or aorta indicates low CO that may require hemodynamic management.</p><p>The structure and function of all other cardiac valves are also assessed. It is critically important to note significant (ie, more than mild) aortic regurgitation (AR), since this will limit delivery of adequate antegrade <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioplegia-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cardioplegia solution</a> into the coronary artery ostia after cross-clamping the ascending aorta. If significant AR is present, much of the cardioplegia solution would regurgitate back through the incompetent aortic valve, with consequent inadequate delivery of antegrade cardioplegia as well as distention of the left ventricle (LV). Management of significant AR during CPB typically includes alternative options (eg, retrograde cardioplegia) and insertion of an LV vent to maintain LV decompression (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management#H277151819\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;, section on 'Aortic regurgitation'</a>). In addition, significant AR is a relative contraindication to the placement of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), since the degree of regurgitation may be increased by diastolic balloon inflation during counterpulsation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>Assessment for regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) is also performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104113\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104113 \">figure 3</a>), as well as for LV or right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction which may require inotropic support. This initial assessment of both regional and global biventricular function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104531\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104531 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104144\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104144 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109762\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef109762 \">movie 3</a>), as well as intravascular volume status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104149\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104149 \">movie 4</a>), allows comparisons during subsequent continuous TEE monitoring. These uses of TEE are similar to those for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery#H3891196679\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery&quot;, section on 'Monitoring with TEE'</a>.)</p><p>A comprehensive TEE examination is also performed to identify other pathology (eg, a coexisting patent foramen ovale that will be repaired during planned open cardiotomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1541780982\"><span class=\"h3\">Removal of air after open cardiotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air accumulates in the left heart chambers during aortic or mitral valve repair or replacement. TEE is employed to identify air in the cardiac chambers, with ongoing monitoring to guide its removal via surgical venting. In particular, air accumulates in the pulmonary veins, the LA appendage, the dome of the LA, and the LV apex. Any intracardiac air may embolize to the coronary, cerebral, and other vital organs once the aortic cross-clamp is removed and the heart begins to contract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114097\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114097 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114100\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114100 \">movie 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114098\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114098 \">movie 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114099\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114099 \">movie 8</a>). Thus, it is important to remove nearly all air prior to allowing full ventricular ejection during weaning from CPB in order to avoid or minimize arterial embolization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass#H640553448\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of problems after cardiopulmonary bypass&quot;, section on 'Arterial air embolization'</a>.)</p><p>Retained air may be eliminated via a <span class=\"nowrap\">vent/catheter</span> in the aortic root as well as via an LV vent catheter. This air will be eliminated just prior to and following removal of the aortic cross-clamp. In the supine position, the right coronary artery (RCA) is in a superior or nondependent position when a patient is supine; thus, air preferentially enters the RCA, which may cause ischemia of the right ventricle (RV) and inferior wall of the LV, as well as arrhythmias (particularly heart block) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114097\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114097 \">movie 5</a>). The deairing process is monitored with TEE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114098\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114098 \">movie 7</a>). In some centers, the patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position during deairing to decrease the risk of cerebral air embolization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2752537987\"><span class=\"h3\">Postbypass period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During and immediately after weaning from CPB, TEE is used to assess function of the repaired or replaced valve (eg, paravalvular leaks) and identify complications such as myocardial ischemia, evidenced by development of new or worsening regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs). Communication with the surgeon regarding complications noted on the TEE examination facilitates decisions to reinstitute CPB for surgical correction, if necessary. These assessments are ideally performed with hemodynamics that are similar to the patient's baseline values obtained after induction of general anesthesia before initiation of CPB. </p><p>After the initial postbypass TEE examination, TEE is employed to continuously monitor left and right ventricular function, as well as intravascular volume status, for the remainder of the intraoperative period. After aortic decannulation, the ascending aorta is evaluated to identify aortic dissection. Dissection is suspected if postbypass hypotension develops and is unresponsive to treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108394\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108394 \">image 1</a>), particularly in patients with a calcific, atheromatous, or dilated ascending aorta. The TEE probe is left in place until the patient is ready for transport to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Modifications for individual patients depend on cardiac valve pathology, as described in each section below, and on additional factors such as severity of ventricular dysfunction or coexisting coronary artery disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery#H3675595158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery&quot;, section on 'Induction and maintenance of general anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>Typically, induction of general anesthesia is accomplished with a &quot;balanced technique&quot; that includes a low dose of a sedative-hypnotic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> 0.5 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> combined with a low dose of an opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg),</span> and a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA). A volatile inhaled anesthetic is often added and titrated to achieve the targeted systemic BP. Patients with critical cardiac valve lesions may develop hypotension during propofol administration due to venous and arterial dilation as well as decreased myocardial contractility. Thus, administration of a vasopressor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> is often necessary. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is a reasonable alternative to propofol as the sedative-hypnotic component of a balanced anesthetic induction technique since its hemodynamic side effects are minimal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-intravenous-induction-agents#H2269410\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Intravenous induction agents&quot;, section on 'Propofol'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-intravenous-induction-agents#H307136729\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Intravenous induction agents&quot;, section on 'Etomidate'</a>.)</p><p>The main anesthetic component during the maintenance phase of general anesthesia may be a volatile inhalation agent or a low-dose total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA) technique with supplemental volatile agent, similar to maintenance for CABG surgery.

These pacing wires are typically placed prior to weaning from CPB. We ensure that pacing thresholds are adequate and perform regular checks to determine whether there is an adequate underlying cardiac rhythm (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass#H1116788115\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass&quot;, section on 'Maintenance of optimal pacemaker function'</a>). If the underlying rhythm remains inadequate following bypass, the surgeon may insert an additional temporary (backup) RV lead prior to chest closure. Another option is placement of a skin lead to allow unipolar right ventricular pacing if bipolar pacing is not effective. Patients with conduction abnormalities that persist after the third postoperative day are referred for consideration of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation.

A rapid HR results in inadequate oxygen delivery to the hypertrophied myocardium due to the decrease in diastolic filling time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94174\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94174 \">figure 4</a>).

Continuous-wave Doppler measurement of the transvalvular gradient can usually be obtained from the deep transgastric or transgastric long-axis views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104117\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef104117 \">image 3</a>). Notably, this transvalvular gradient may be underestimated by suboptimal alignment of the ultrasound beam with the stenotic jet. Since the transvalvular gradient may be underestimated, severe AS is not excluded if the valve appearance suggests this diagnosis but the mean aortic valve gradient is &lt;40 mm Hg. Calculation of aortic valve area calculation employing the continuity equation also requires beam alignment with maximum left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and aortic jet velocities. Planimetry of the aortic valve orifice during systolic opening provides a potential alternative estimate of effective aortic valve area but should be interpreted with caution due to technical limitations such as artifact caused by calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Moderate sedation was associated with lower mortality risk (both in-hospital [1.5 versus 2.4 percent] and at 30 days [2.3 versus 4.0 percent]), lower intraprocedural inotrope use (29.3 versus 43.7 percent), and shorter hospital stay (6.0 versus 6.5 days). However, procedural success was slightly but statistically significantly lower among patients receiving moderate sedation (97.9 versus 98.6 percent).</p><p>As a practical matter, if TEE use is anticipated (eg, to detect paravalvular leaks), general anesthesia is usually necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Since paravalvular leaks can develop with time and increases in systemic pressure, TEE examination should be repeated several times after termination of CPB. Leaflet dysfunction or greater than trace paravalvular leak will generally trigger a decision to return to CPB and reestablish diastolic cardiac arrest in order to fix the problem.</p><p>Structures adjacent to the prosthetic valve are also examined to detect unintentional damage. For example, the base of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve may become damaged as a result of a suture being placed too deeply in the posterior aspect of the aortic annulus.

In addition, the width of the vena contracta should be measured because it is easy to acquire, reproducible, and relatively independent of ventricular loading conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105881\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105881 \">movie 10</a>). This measurement is made at the narrowest neck of the mitral regurgitation jet, obtained in a midesophageal four-chamber view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other methods include obtaining the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) to determine effective regurgitant orifice or regurgitant volume. Notably, MR severity is typically underestimated after induction of general anesthesia due to decreases in sympathetic tone and afterload, and MR severity can vary considerably during surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Thus, if intraoperative confirmation of severity is critically important, assessment should be performed during hemodynamic conditions approximating the patient's preoperative baseline. Transient use of a vasopressor agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> may be necessary to restore baseline hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Reassessment of MR severity is prudent when hemodynamic conditions change (eg, due to alterations in loading conditions or development of myocardial ischemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In acute MR, the jet area may not be large and the jet is often markedly eccentric; thus, acute MR may be underestimated or not appreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Identification of a flail leaflet or ruptured papillary muscle, pulmonary vein systolic flow reversal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a hyperdynamic LV with low systemic output by Doppler suggest acute MR, even in the absence of a large MR jet.

For patients with primary MR, intraoperative three-dimensional (3D) TEE has been used to enable detailed study of valve morphology and quantitative analysis of annular size and leaflet dimensions important to the repair of degenerative mitral valves (resulting in mitral valve prolapse, partial flail, or flail leaflet). Carpentier's classification of mitral valve regurgitation is often used to facilitate a common language between the echocardiographer and surgeon, and permit an assessment of the etiology of MR and the likelihood of successful repair. Type 1 lesions (with normal leaflet motion) and type 2 lesions (excessive leaflet motion) are typically more amenable to operative repair than type 3 lesions (restricted leaflet motion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35</a>]. Other assessments to determine whether the mitral valve can be repaired include the estimated risk of post-repair systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), precise location of the left circumflex coronary artery relative to the location of annular sutures, prediction of the correct annuloplasty device size, and prediction of the largest size mitral valve prosthesis that will fit in the patient (based on intertrigonal distance in case the repair fails). Repair is less likely to be successful if there is extensive calcification or degeneration of a leaflet or annulus, prolapse of more than one-third of the leaflet tissue, or extensive chordal fusion, calcification, or papillary muscle rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In addition, the LV is examined for regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) that may be associated with ischemic MR, or global LV dysfunction or dilatation due to ischemia or chronic volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The RV is also examined for possible dilation and dysfunction due to chronic pulmonary hypertension. In some patients, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is noted, and may be an indication for concomitant tricuspid valve repair.

The left atriotomy may be made directly behind the right atrium (RA) or the LA can be entered across the atrial septum via a right atriotomy. In all instances, however, bicaval venous cannulation is recommended to facilitate adequate venous return to the pump for CPB. A less invasive approach to mitral valve surgery via a small right thoracotomy is possible, with or without robotic assistance.</p><p>Any approach requires establishment of CPB and diastolic arrest of the heart prior to opening the LA. Particular attention to myocardial protection is important (eg, use of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia) since it will be necessary for the LV to pump against the higher systemic afterload after repair or replacement of the leaking mitral valve.</p><p>If possible, the surgeon attempts to repair the mitral valve, particularly if MR is degenerative due to thickened redundant leaflets or prolapsed due to ruptured chordae tendinae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79932\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79932 \">figure 7</a>). In selected patients with bileaflet prolapse or other complex mitral valve disease, a simple suture to attach the midpoints of the anterior and posterior leaflets together may be employed, resulting in a &quot;double orifice&quot; mitral valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. This Alfieri stitch procedure rarely results in complete correction of mitral regurgitation, but may be selected in a high-risk patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical procedures for severe chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Valve repair'</a>.)</p><p>If mitral valve replacement is necessary, either a bioprosthetic or mechanical mitral valve may be implanted (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of prosthetic heart valve for surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement&quot;</a>). After completion of the procedure, the LA are closed and air is removed from the left heart prior to removal of the aortic cross-clamp. After the cross-clamp is removed, the heart is reperfused, and the patient is weaned from CPB. Removal of residual air is guided by TEE monitoring.

A potential advantage of this &quot;beating heart&quot; approach is the ability to use real-time TEE assessment of the adequacy of correction of MR so that adjustments may be made if needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transcatheter mitral valve repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anesthetic techniques for such minimally invasive procedures should facilitate early mobilization. Thus, short-acting anesthetic agents are selected and normothermia is maintained so that tracheal extubation may be accomplished shortly after completion of surgery (eg, one to two hours).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H675088507\"><span class=\"h2\">Postbypass TEE assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A repaired mitral valve is interrogated for residual MR immediately after weaning from CPB. If significant residual MR is present, the mechanism causing it is identified (eg, inadequate repair or a paravalvular leak around an annuloplasty ring or implanted mitral prosthesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The surgeon and echocardiographer (typically, the cardiac anesthesiologist) must jointly decide whether further attempts to repair the mitral valve are feasible, or whether replacement of the mitral valve will be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Postbypass hemodynamics must be considered in evaluating the adequacy of the repair, since hypotension may lead to erroneous underestimation of MR severity. Thus, BP should be normalized before final surgical decisions are made.</p><p>After a mitral valve repair procedure that includes preservation of the anterior leaflet, it is also important to assess and document presence or absence of SAM of the redundant leaflets and whether left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,43</a>]. On TEE examination, SAM is identified when the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is drawn anteriorly into the LVOT during systole, causing LVOT obstruction and concomitant MR. The LVOT obstruction can be identified by Doppler color flow mapping and the resulting gradient can be quantified with spectral Doppler interrogation. Notably, LVOT obstruction is exacerbated by LV under filling (ie, hypovolemia) and by positive inotropic agents. If SAM does not resolve after volume loading and withdrawal of inotropic agents, then revision of the mitral valve repair or mitral valve replacement may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. If this problem persists after further surgical revisions to repair the native valve, then mitral valve replacement is usually required. </p><p>After mitral valve replacement, TEE is used to rule out paravalvular leak, abnormal prosthetic leaflet mobility, or a high gradient across the mitral prosthesis indicating a stuck leaflet or mitral stenosis caused by attempted repair with use of an undersized annuloplasty ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>After either mitral valve repair or replacement, it is also necessary to assess left and right ventricular function, and to check for possible injury to adjacent structures (eg, damage to the aortic valve causing new AR or to the circumflex artery with new RWMAs in the lateral or inferior walls of the LV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cardiac-valve-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Finally, removal of residual air is guided by TEE monitoring.

Dopamine (at a dose of 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute)</span> or epinephrine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> infusions are commonly used to achieve baseline BP values (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>Typically, patients who had some degree of LV impairment prior to the procedure will require inotropic support during the immediate postbypass period due to the newly increased impedance on the LV when regurgitation into the LA is no longer occurring via an incompetent mitral valve. In some cases, acute LV failure occurs with attempts to terminate CPB. Inodilator agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a> may be employed, particularly in patients with elevated PVR, often with concomitant use of norepinephrine to avoid excessive systemic vasodilatation. An IABP may be inserted to improve coronary perfusion to the left heart and provide afterload reduction in selected patients with significant LV dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute refractory right heart failure with a high PVR may occur in some patients during attempted weaning from CPB.

The chest radiograph (CXR) may reveal signs of pulmonary edema and right heart enlargement in advanced cases.</p><p>Patients should be medically optimized before proceeding with elective mitral valve surgery. Control of heart rate (HR) with avoidance of tachycardia is particularly important; thus, antiarrhythmic and antitachycardia drugs are maintained up to and including the day of surgery.

Any tachyarrhythmia (eg, sinus tachycardia or AF with rapid ventricular response) can result in sudden severe hypotension and pulmonary edema due to inadequate time during diastole for blood in the LA to empty into the LV through the stenotic mitral valve. The resultant sudden decrease in LV filling, stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) causes hypotension, while the sudden increase in LA pressure causes pulmonary edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although a relatively slow HR is optimal, severe bradycardia is avoided because the limited flow across the stenotic mitral valve decreases LV filling and SV. Thus, CO is partially dependent on an adequate HR. Severe bradycardia associated with hypotension is treated with small bolus doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> 3 to 10 mg. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart rhythm</strong> &ndash; Although sinus rhythm (SR) is preferred, many patients with MS have chronic AF because of LA dilation. The presence of AF is less important for patients with MS than those with aortic stenosis (AS) because there is less dependence on maintenance of LA contraction (atrial &quot;kick&quot;) to achieve adequate LV filling.
