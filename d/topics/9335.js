Obese individuals often develop health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. A modest weight loss of 5 to 10 percent may be sufficient to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes and other obesity-related illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>However, the availability of safe and effective weight loss therapies is limited. While bariatric surgery has proven efficacy in treating morbidly obese patients, it is not widely used in the class I obese population (body mass index [BMI] 30 to 34.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> due to its invasiveness, cost, and potentially lifelong side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Intragastric balloon therapy is a minimally invasive, temporary method of inducing weight loss. It relies upon a soft, saline-filled balloon placed in the stomach to promote the feeling of satiety and restriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58305 \">figure 1</a>). The weight loss mechanism of intragastric balloon therapy is restrictive. Any balloon with a volume of 400 mL or greater can induce satiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Another possible mechanism of action that may also contribute to weight loss is by delaying gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As with any bariatric procedure, the patient's compliance with lifestyle modifications is essential for achieving and sustaining weight loss during and after therapy.</p><p>The indications for intragastric balloon therapy, the choices of available balloons, potential adverse effects, and strategies of maintaining weight loss after balloon removal are discussed in this topic. Other methods of achieving weight loss are discussed separately.

Patients are typically started on a proton pump inhibitor before balloon insertion and prescribed a three- to five-day course of an antiemetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aprepitant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aprepitant</a>) and an anticholinergic (eg, butylscopolamine) to be used during the first week of therapy.</p><p>Early balloon removal may be necessary if symptoms persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/11,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,33</a>]. However, very few patients (4 to 7 percent) continue to experience significant gastrointestinal symptoms after the first week of therapy. In clinical trials, early removal rates for the Orbera and ReShape balloons were 7 and 9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>]. Of note, balloon retrieval requires special endoscopic equipment specific to each balloon. In general, though, it requires a needle to deflate the balloon and a sturdy grasper or snare to pull the balloon out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H805664110\"><span class=\"h2\">Serious adverse events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported with intragastric balloon therapy, related to either the balloon or the procedure. In one study of the ReShape balloon, 3 percent of patients experienced balloon- or procedure-related SAEs that were not related to gastric accommodation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H586046318\"><span class=\"h3\">Balloon-related serious adverse events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intragastric balloons left in the stomach longer than the intended duration of therapy are at risk of rupturing and migrating into the intestine. While most migrated balloons were excreted successfully, some caused intestinal obstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Thus, patients should be followed closely to ensure timely balloon removal, which reduces the risk of balloon migration and intestinal obstruction. </p><p>Many of the balloons are filled with saline that is dyed blue. If a rupture occurs, the patient's urine may turn blue or green because the spilled dye is absorbed and then excreted by the kidneys. This mechanism warns the patient that the balloon has ruptured, so it can be retrieved before it migrates and causes bowel obstruction.</p><p>Other balloon-related SAEs included severe vomiting, abdominal pain, epigastric pain, nausea, bleeding ulcer, gastric outlet obstruction, and gastric perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/31,32,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62453770\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure-related serious adverse events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most procedure-related SAEs occur during balloon removal, including esophageal tear, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and esophageal perforation. The endoscopist performing intragastric balloon insertion and removal must be properly trained to avoid procedure-related complications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2561360792\"><span class=\"h3\">August 2017 FDA update to health care providers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an update in August 2017 to alert health care providers of five reports of unanticipated deaths that occurred from 2016 to present in patients with liquid-filled intragastric balloon systems used to treat obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Four reports involved the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System, and one report involved the ReShape Integrated Dual Balloon System. According to the FDA update, these five deaths all occurred within one month of balloon placement, but neither the root cause nor the incidence rate has been determined. Two other deaths with known causes, one due to gastric perforation involving an Orbera balloon, and another due to esophageal perforation involving a ReShape balloon, have been reported to the FDA in the same time period. The FDA recommends close monitoring of patients who receive intragastric balloon therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403953652\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL TREATMENT AFTER INTRAGASTRIC BALLOON THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regaining of lost weight is a common problem in treating obesity. With continued diet and exercise, 50 percent of the weight loss achieved during intragastric balloon therapy can be maintained for at least one year after balloon removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Behavior modification strategies should be continued to minimize subsequent weight gain.

Those who were compliant with diet and exercise during the initial treatment are good candidates for retreatment; others are unlikely to benefit from repeat intragastric balloon therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3401619918\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjustable balloon system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have demonstrated that 80 to 90 percent of weight loss is achieved during the first three to four months of intragastric balloon therapy, after which time the stomach accommodates and the restrictive effect is partially lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Thus, an increase in the balloon volume may induce more weight loss. </p><p>The Spatz adjustable balloon system permits the volume of the balloon to be adjusted. Preliminary results demonstrated that patients lost an additional 9.4 kg after receiving upward adjustments to the volume of their balloons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intragastric-balloon-therapy-for-weight-loss/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Conversely, individuals who experienced balloon intolerance benefited from downward adjustments.

It entails placing a soft saline- or gas-filled balloon in the stomach to promote a feeling of satiety and restriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58305 \">figure 1</a>). Because its weight loss mechanism is mostly restrictive, its efficacy largely relies upon a patient's adherence to lifestyle changes (ie, diet and exercise). (See <a href=\"#H2957354138\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intragastric balloon therapy is an option for the treatment of obesity in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> in Europe or 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> in the United States. Patients must have failed previous attempts at weight management with diet and exercise alone. Intragastric balloon therapy can be used for overweight or obese patients who do not yet meet BMI criteria for surgery. In patients who are candidates for bariatric surgery, intragastric balloon therapy can be used as a bridge to surgery (when BMI &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> or in place of surgery for those who refuse or who lack access to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1860395853\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute contraindications to intragastric balloon therapy include previous gastric surgery, coagulation disorders, any bleeding lesion in the gastrointestinal tract, pregnancy or desire to become pregnant, alcoholism or drug addiction, severe liver disease, and any contraindication to endoscopy. Relative contraindications include previous abdominal surgery, large hiatal hernia, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and psychiatric disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1622798012\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intragastric balloons differ in their volume, duration in the stomach, adjustability, and means of insertion and removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107783\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107783 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Orbera and ReShape are endoscopically inserted and removed balloons that remain in the stomach for six months. Both balloons have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). (See <a href=\"#H2761713170\" class=\"local\">'Orbera'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1072464395\" class=\"local\">'ReShape'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obalon balloons are swallowed but endoscopically removed at six months; the aggregate volume varies depending upon the number of balloons inserted (one to three). Obalon balloons have also received FDA approval. (See <a href=\"#H1622801687\" class=\"local\">'Obalon'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Spatz balloon is endoscopically inserted and removed; its volume can be adjusted while remaining in the stomach for up to one year. (See <a href=\"#H1221711839\" class=\"local\">'Spatz'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Elipse is a procedureless balloon that does not require endoscopy for insertion or removal. At approximately four months, it deflates by itself and is naturally excreted. (See <a href=\"#H3093650794\" class=\"local\">'Elipse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intragastric balloon therapy can achieve 8 to 15 percent total body weight loss (or 25 to 38 percent excess weight loss) depending on the type of balloon used. Although there are no direct comparison trials, this degree of short-term weight loss compares favorably with behavior modification or pharmacotherapy but less favorably with bariatric surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2621485517\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of intragastric balloons'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3215069284\" class=\"local\">'Comparison with other weight loss therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first week of intragastric balloon therapy, a majority of patients will develop some form of gastrointestinal symptoms due to gastric accommodation to the balloon. The combination of a proton pump inhibitor, an antiemetic, and an anticholinergic helps most patients through the first week of therapy, after which time the symptoms greatly diminish. Serious adverse events rarely occur during intragastric balloon therapy and can be minimized by timely balloon removal and adequate training of endoscopists performing the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1917508854\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regaining of lost weight is a common problem in treating obesity. After intragastric balloon therapy, behavior modification (diet, exercise, lifestyle changes) should be continued to minimize subsequent weight gain. Additional adjunctive measures to sustain or augment weight loss after intragastric balloon therapy include weight loss medications, repeated balloon therapy after at least a one-month &quot;balloon holiday,&quot; balloon volume adjustment (eg, with Spatz), or bariatric surgery.
