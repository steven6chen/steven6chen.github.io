As a result, patients are generally referred to a tertiary care facility or to adult endoscopists who perform a high volume of procedures.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the technical aspects of performing ERCP in children. Indications for ERCP in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP for biliary disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP for pancreatic disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION AND SEDATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because most ERCP procedures in children are performed by adult gastroenterologists, a close working collaboration between an adult and a pediatric gastroenterologist is important during patient preparation and the procedure itself. The preparation and sedation of a child undergoing ERCP is similar to that used for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The procedure should be explained to the child in a manner appropriate for the age and level of intellectual and emotional development.</p><p>The endoscopist must choose between conscious sedation and general anesthesia after considering the pertinent risks and taking into account personal skill and experience and the expected complexity of the procedure. A state of deep sedation from which the patient is not easily aroused is often required, since young children and some adolescents cannot fully cooperate with procedures under lesser degrees of conscious sedation. Most children can be sedated adequately with a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>. Children frequently require much higher doses of midazolam on a milligram per kilogram basis than adults. In occasions, children can also be sedated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> with anesthesia support.</p><p>Postprocedure monitoring is the same as for other endoscopic procedures requiring sedation. Personnel with appropriate training in pediatric sedation and monitoring are required for either conscious sedation or general anesthesia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data to guide recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis for ERCP in children. As a result, the principles of antibiotic prophylaxis in adults are frequently applied in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibiotic prophylaxis for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ERCP is generally associated with a higher risk for bacteremia than upper endoscopy alone, particularly in the presence of biliary obstruction. We suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cystic or obstructing lesions of the biliary or pancreatic ducts should be given antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent cholangitis or infective pancreatitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered on an individual patient basis in organ transplant recipients, those who are otherwise immunocompromised, and patients with indwelling catheters. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOSCOPIC EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ERCP is performed in neonates and infants younger than 12 months with a pediatric duodenoscope which has an insertion tube diameter of 7.5 mm, a channel of 2.0 mm, and an elevator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Use of a pediatric duodenoscope is mandatory in neonates and in infants younger than 12 months and is preferred for small children (eg, younger than three years). A standard adult duodenoscope (insertion tube diameter approximately 11 mm) can be used in older children and adolescents.</p><p>Pediatric duodenoscopes with a 2.0 mm channel permit passage of catheters up to 5 FR diameter. More complicated therapeutic maneuvers, such as placement of endoprostheses and passage of some dilators and retrieval baskets, require instruments with a larger (3.2 mm) channel. An adult duodenoscope with all the accessories should be available for therapeutic interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications that may be useful during ERCP include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> and hyoscine-N-butyl bromide (Buscopan) to reduce duodenal motility, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> to facilitate identification and cannulation of the minor papilla. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22754217\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscope insertion and position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duodenoscope is inserted into the second portion of the duodenum with the patient in the prone position. The optimal route to the papilla is the &quot;short route,&quot; which involves straightening the instrument along the lesser curvature of the stomach to bring the papilla directly en face. The instrument is withdrawn slowly, keeping the controls locked and the papilla in view. This involves rotating the scope to the right while angling the tip up. In some infants it is not possible to perform this maneuver. In such cases cannulation of the papilla is performed with the &quot;long route,&quot; in which the instrument lies along the greater curvature of the stomach. Control of the endoscope tip and elevator are more difficult in this configuration, and there is more discomfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22754210\"><span class=\"h2\">Cannulation of the papilla</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles of cannulation are similar to those used in adult patients, with the additional limitations of space within the duodenum in small patients. A tapered Teflon catheter (3.5 F at the distal end) or a mini-sphincterotome (4 F at the distal end) is introduced into the papilla. A 65 percent iodinated contrast agent is injected manually using a 5 or 10 mL syringe. While some endoscopists prefer nonionic low osmolar agents, there is no proof that these more expensive agents reduce the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Dilution of the contrast material to 30 percent is preferred for optimal visualization if ducts are known to be dilated or if filling defects are anticipated. Meticulous fluoroscopy is equally if not more important than the concentration of contrast for optimal imaging; filling of common bile duct or pancreatic duct should be monitored continuously during contrast injection.</p><p>It is important to minimize the procedure time to avoid abdominal over-distension and respiratory compromise, especially in young infants, such as those undergoing investigation for neonatal cholestasis. In our experience the mean time from introduction of the duodenoscope into the mouth to complete withdrawal is 10 minutes, with a range of 2 to 20 minutes. To reduce the time of the procedure, the cannula is placed into the biopsy channel of the duodenoscope prior to passage, and the instrument is withdrawn as soon as the common bile duct is identified fluoroscopically. If contrast does not enter the common bile duct but only refluxes to the duodenum, or if only the pancreatic duct is visualized, the cannula is left in the curved cephalad position and the endoscope is slowly withdrawn. This may change the cannula tip orientation and straighten out the route from the papillary orifice to the common duct. Lateral and vertical angulation of the cannula should be tried if these attempts are unsuccessful. It is helpful to engage the orifice with the cannula tip and then rotate the scope tip and cannula to the left, followed by orientation of the cannula tip in the cephalad direction. Deep selective cannulation of the bile duct is generally not possible for neonates given the small duct diameter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22754239\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because ERCP requires fluoroscopy, it is usually performed in a radiology suite designed for adult patients. Pediatric endoscopy assistants and specially trained nurses can help reduce preprocedure anxiety, monitor the clinical status of the patient, assist in holding and reassuring, and administering medications, handling catheters, and injecting contrast material. The heart rate and oxygen saturation must be continuously monitored. Resuscitation medications and appropriate equipment should be available. A recovery area equipped with monitors and specialized pediatric nurses familiar with the needs of children is necessary.</p><p>ERCP can be performed on an ambulatory basis when performed for diagnosis only. Therapeutic ERCP has a greater potential risk for serious complications and overnight observation in the hospital may be indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUCCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children older than one year and adolescents, the rate of successful cannulation is more than 95 percent, comparable to reports in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/3-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-20</a>]. In neonates and young infants, the rate of successful cannulation of the common bile duct is often lower than in adults, ranging from 27 to 95 percent in various reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/1,3,21-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,21-30</a>]. Experience of the endoscopists may account for a large part of the variability. </p><p>In our unpublished experience, the procedure was successful in 98 percent of children older than one year (216 of 220 cases). Our ERCP success in neonates and young infants with neonatal cholestasis was 93 percent (171 of 184 cases). The procedure was unsuccessful in thirteen patients because of duodenal malrotation in two and inability to cannulate in eleven. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of complications in children has not been well established. In children older than one year, complication rates are between 3 and 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/7,10,18-21,23,25,27,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,18-21,23,25,27,29-31</a>]. Complications include pancreatitis, infection, hemorrhage, and perforation, and are more common among patients undergoing therapeutic ERCP as compared with diagnostic ERCP. Major complications are rare.</p><p>The range and frequency of complications are illustrated by the following case series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 245 children (mean age 12 years) who underwent 329 diagnostic or therapeutic examinations for a variety of biliary or pancreatic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There were a total of 32 complications (10 percent), most of which were pancreatitis. There were no deaths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series, 61 children (mean age 7 years, range 3 days to 16.9 years) underwent a total of 99 ERCPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Of these patients, 51 percent were younger than one year, 84 percent had biliary indications, and 16 percent had pancreatic indications for the procedure. The complication rate was 4 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(4/99),</span> and included marked pancreatitis and transient mild elevations of pancreatic enzymes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our unpublished experience with 125 ERCPs in children older than one year, we had two complications (1.6 percent). Of 75 patients with biliary disorders, one patient with choledochal cyst and cystolithiasis had acute cholangitis that improved with antibiotics. Of 50 children with pancreatic disorders, there was one case of mild acute ERCP-related pancreatitis in a patient with recurrent pancreatitis and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the largest series included 425 ERCPs performed on 276 pediatric patients, with ages ranging from 72 days to 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Targeted duct cannulation was achieved in over 95 percent of cases, and therapeutic interventions were common (81.3 percent). The most common complication was post-ERCP pancreatitis which occurred in 26 cases (7.7 percent), and the majority were mild by consensus definition. Procedural characteristics significantly associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis included: pancreatogram, pancreatic sphincterotomy, pancreatic duct stenting, and pancreatic duct stricture dilation. Immediate post-sphincterotomy bleeding occurred twice (1.1 percent), and both cases were successfully treated during the procedure. There was one instance of a possible delayed bleed after sphincterotomy. No mortality was observed. Thus, ERCP can be safely applied in younger patients by skilled endoscopists. The complication rate found in this series closely parallels that observed in adults.</p><p/><p>It is unclear whether complication rates are slightly higher in infants younger than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/1,21-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21-28</a>]. One of the large series cited above reported no complications in children younger than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In our unpublished experience with 184 neonates and young infants, minor complications without clinical significance occurred in 24 patients (13 percent), which is higher than our complication rate in children older than one year (1.6 percent). Two neonates had transient opiate-induced respiratory depression, and four young infants had non-opioid respiratory depression, which resolved with oxygen administration. In 17 patients, minor acute duodenal erosions were observed without clinical consequences. One neonate had abdominal distention for 10 hours after completion of ERCP, which resolved without treatment. There were no major complications in either series.</p><p>Pancreatitis may be a more common complication of ERCP among children with underlying pancreatitis as compared with those undergoing ERCP for other indications. In a series of 42 ERCP examinations in 37 children and one young adult, all of whom had a history of pancreatitis, mild pancreatitis was observed in three patients (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. No patients with biliary tract pathology developed pancreatitis. Another series reported ten cases of post-ERCP pancreatitis in 67 patients undergoing ERCP for chronic pancreatitis (15 percent). The rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis was highest in the patients undergoing pancreatic duct stent placement (7 of 28 procedures; 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a larger series of 432 ERCPs in 313 patients younger than 19 years, pancreatitis occurred after 47 procedures (10.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Post-ERCP pancreatitis was positively associated with pancreatic duct injection and pancreatic sphincterotomy, but was less likely in patients with a history of chronic pancreatitis.</p><p>To minimize the risk of pancreatitis, a sphincterotome with a guidewire can be used for cannulation. Under fluoroscopic control, the guidewire is advanced into the common bile duct, then the sphincterotome is advanced and contrast injected. This approach avoids injection of contrast into the pancreatic duct and reduces the risk of pancreatitis. There is some evidence that administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> via rectal suppository at the time of the ERCP may help to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis, based on a preponderance of evidence in adults. There are no studies in children. Practice varies in adults and children, with some endoscopists routinely using indomethacin during ERCP for prophylaxis, and others using this for selected high-risk patients.
