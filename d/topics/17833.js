These membranes consist of the dura mater and the arachnoid and pia mater; the latter two together are called the leptomeninges. The subarachnoid space lies between the arachnoid and pia mater and contains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and arteries supplying the brain parenchyma. When tumor invades the leptomeninges, tumor cells can be disseminated via the CSF and spread throughout the subarachnoid space, causing multifocal signs and symptoms.</p><p>The treatment of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) from solid tumors is reviewed here. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of LM, and leptomeningeal involvement in hematologic malignancies, especially large cell lymphomas and acute leukemias, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-from-solid-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Leptomeningeal metastasis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Involvement of the central nervous system with acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment include stabilizing or improving neurologic function, prolonging survival, and, if these are not possible, palliating symptoms. However, the prognosis varies considerably depending upon the tumor type and extent of both neurologic and systemic disease; these factors can help determine the appropriate therapeutic approach for an individual patient. The key parameters separating poor-risk from good-risk patients are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54352\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54352 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Poor-risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a low Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a>); multiple, serious, fixed neurologic deficits; and extensive systemic cancer with limited therapeutic options have a poor prognosis even with active treatment. Management of LM in this setting focuses on alleviating symptoms. A palliative approach should also be considered for patients with leptomeningeal gliomatosis and those with encephalopathy due to extensive brain infiltration (carcinomatous encephalitis), since the prognosis is poor even with combined-modality therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The palliative regimen can include the following components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) can be useful for relief of symptoms caused by localized LM. This may include whole brain radiation for patients with leptomeningeal tumor in cerebral sulci or prominent cranial neuropathies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesics are given for persistent pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticosteroids rarely reverse neurologic deficits from LM (except sometimes when the disease is breast cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma), but they may improve headache and radicular pain more effectively than analgesics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticonvulsants should be reserved for patients with seizures (10 to 20 percent of cases) and routine prophylactic use should be avoided. Of note, central nervous system (CNS) metastases from melanoma (either brain or leptomeningeal) are associated with a high incidence of seizures, probably a result of their tendency to involve the cortex and hemorrhage. Some experts favor use of prophylactic anticonvulsants in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors#H784669897\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Patients without a history of a seizure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrocephalus from obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways may be a significant cause of intractable headache, encephalopathy, and incontinence. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting can be an effective palliative procedure that relieves symptoms and improves quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serotonin reuptake inhibitors or stimulant medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>) may be beneficial for patients with significant depression or fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Good-risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Good-risk patients include those with a KPS of 60 or above, modest or no fixed neurologic deficits, minimal systemic disease burden, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a cancer for which there are reasonable treatment options. For these individuals, treatment is directed at controlling the tumor. RT is used to treat bulky or symptomatic areas of leptomeningeal disease, intrathecal (IT) or systemic chemotherapy that can cross the blood-brain barrier is given to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the CSF, and extraneural tumor is treated aggressively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of LM in good-risk patients must be directed toward the entire neuraxis. If therapy is limited to symptomatic areas, disease progression inevitably occurs in untreated sites. An exception to this principle is that irradiation of the entire neuraxis is typically not performed due to the potential toxicity of craniospinal radiation therapy (RT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased ICP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is treated initially with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, and a dose of 8 mg twice a day is usually effective. Dexamethasone should be started early and the dose reduced as quickly as possible until the lowest effective dose is achieved. Glucocorticoids tend not to reverse neurologic deficits associated with LM, in contrast to brain metastases with surrounding edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p>If elevated ICP cannot be controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt can relieve hydrocephalus and other symptoms of elevated ICP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In experienced hands, VP shunting is safe and efficacious. A report of VP shunting in 37 consecutive patients with hydrocephalus caused by LM reported substantial relief of symptoms in most patients and complications that were related only to shunt placement (one cerebral hemorrhage probably caused by poor technique) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. No patient suffered infection or abdominal seeding, perhaps because postoperative survival was relatively short.</p><p>One caveat is that &quot;communicating hydrocephalus&quot; caused by LM may substantially elevate ICP and cause symptoms of elevated ICP without significantly increasing size of the ventricles. In the appropriate clinical context, the diagnosis can be made by documenting an elevated opening pressure (&gt;20 to 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>0) at the time of lumbar puncture (LP). Although the surgical procedure may be more difficult because the ventricles are relatively small, a VP shunt can relieve symptoms in these patients in a manner similar to relief in those patients with substantial hydrocephalus.</p><p>For patients with elevated ICP and obstructive hydrocephalus, shunting may be indicated if obstruction does not clear with RT. If only a single ventricle is obstructed, shunting should be avoided, as the decompressed ventricle can cause symptomatic brain shift to the shunted side and increase focal symptoms.</p><p>In addition to perioperative morbidity and mortality, potential complications arising after shunt placement include infection, failure due to tumor deposition within the shunt, and tumor seeding of the abdominal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, intrathecal (IT) therapy is no longer possible as the injected material is immediately shunted into the abdominal cavity. An <span class=\"nowrap\">off/on</span> valve is ineffective as the injected agent remains in the ventricular system and diffuses into the surrounding brain, increasing potential toxicity, until the valve is opened.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment CSF flow study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to RT or IT chemotherapy, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow study via a radionuclide cisternogram may be helpful although not available or used in all centers. This study will identify areas of obstruction that will prevent the chemotherapy from being homogeneously distributed, potentially decreasing efficacy and increasing toxicity. As an example, the administration of intraventricular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) through an Ommaya reservoir can cause leukoencephalopathy even at conventional doses if there is a block to egress of the drug from the ventricular system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-non-platinum-cancer-chemotherapy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of non-platinum cancer chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Leukoencephalopathy'</a>.)</p><p>Abnormal CSF flow is seen in up to two-thirds of patients with LM, often without evidence of hydrocephalus or other abnormalities on conventional neuroimaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Common sites of obstructed CSF flow include the base of the brain (ventricular outlet obstruction), within the spinal canal, and over the cortical convexities. For centers that obtain CSF flow studies, RT can be delivered to areas of obstruction, even though no lesion is identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and it potentially can reverse the flow abnormality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Response evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meticulous assessment of the response to therapy is essential to support the continued use of aggressive treatment. Documentation of failure to respond to the initial regimen permits an early change of therapy or the institution of palliative care when appropriate. The original abnormalities in both imaging and CSF studies should be carefully assessed for evidence of response or progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">CSF cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of CSF cytology is an important component of response assessment during IT therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If possible, CSF should be sampled at each site (lumbar and ventricular) from which malignant cells were originally identified to demonstrate normalization of cytology. Because differences in response in ventricular and lumbar fluid are common, absence of malignant cells in the ventricular compartment does not guarantee resolution of previously documented malignancy within the lumbar CSF. In the context of clinical trials, many investigators require two successive negative evaluations from each site before reporting a cytologic response. In clinical practice, the requirement for multiple LPs in patients who do not have ventricular reservoirs can be problematic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Other methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The detection of chromosomal abnormalities by interphase cytogenetics using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be useful for patients with known cytologic abnormalities in cells present in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, CSF flow cytometry or serial immunocytochemical staining may be useful in patients with lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma#H6054645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Molecular techniques'</a>.) </p><p>Biomarkers that are specific to the tumor (for example CA-125 for epithelial ovarian cancer) may be quite helpful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81558 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-from-solid-tumors#H1010278\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors&quot;, section on 'Tumor markers'</a>.)</p><p>Rare cell capture technology has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], although its role in serial response evaluation has not been evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-from-solid-tumors#H363877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors&quot;, section on 'Circulating tumor cells'</a>.) </p><p>These approaches may be more sensitive than routine cytologic examination in detecting residual malignant cells in the CSF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) appears to be more effective at relieving symptoms than intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy. As a result, our standard treatment includes palliative RT (eg, 30 in 3 Gy daily fractions) to sites of symptomatic or bulky disease. For poor-prognosis patients, 20 Gy in 5 daily fractions is sometimes used to minimize patient burden and treatment time. In addition, some centers administer RT to sites of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, as demonstrated by a radionuclide CSF flow study, prior to IT chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment CSF flow study'</a> above.)</p><p>To avoid excess myelosuppression and other toxicity such as severe fatigue, esophagitis, diarrhea, and nausea, focal rather than craniospinal RT is preferred. Radiation is usually targeted to symptomatic areas even in the absence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial irradiation, typically utilizing whole brain fields, is used in patients with focal collections of malignant cells causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Patients with symptomatic noncommunicating hydrocephalus that does not clear rapidly with treatment may benefit from early shunting. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Increased ICP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial irradiation is used in patients with isolated cranial neuropathies. Although whole brain fields are often used, skull base radiation can sometimes be used if there is no gross disease in the sulci or disease causing obstruction. The typical schedule is 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, patients with cytology-proven carcinomatous meningitis and symptomatic communicating hydrocephalus undergo CSF shunting, but the site of CSF flow disturbance remains occult radiographically (eg, enhanced brain and spine magnetic resonance are negative and indium-111 studies cannot be performed after ventriculoperitoneal [VP] shunt). Since communicating hydrocephalus can be caused by malignant cells in the subarachnoid space obstructing normal CSF resorption pathways, whole brain RT may be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Alternatively, skull base radiation using 25 Gy in 10 fractions may resolve the block while allowing for subsequent brain irradiation, if it becomes necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lower-extremity weakness, or bladder or bowel dysfunction, generally receive lumbosacral spine irradiation.</p><p/><p>Major adverse effects during or after focal RT alone are unusual. However, with more extensive fields, major effects of RT may include myelosuppression, mucositis, esophagitis, and leukoencephalopathy. Leukoencephalopathy may be especially prominent when cranial RT is administered prior to or concurrently with IT or systemic chemotherapy, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX). Although many patients do not live long enough to suffer the delayed effects of RT, some do. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Focal neurologic deficits generally do not improve, although RT frequently alleviates radicular pain and encephalopathic symptoms. However, RT may delay or prevent the development of new neurologic deficits. In addition, involved-field RT can restore normal CSF flow dynamics if it reduces the bulky disease responsible for CSF obstruction. Most good-risk patients also receive IT chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRATHECAL CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for LM, although its effectiveness may be limited and its superiority compared with systemic treatment has not been established in randomized trials. Currently, the drugs most commonly used for IT chemotherapy are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, and, less often, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thiotepa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiotepa</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-cytarabine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Liposomal cytarabine</a> has been discontinued in the United States and Canada but may still be available in some regions. Experimental agents including monoclonal antibodies are assuming increasing importance and are discussed below.</p><p>The role for IT therapy in LM from lymphoma and leukemia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Leptomeningeal metastasis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Involvement of the central nervous system with acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraventricular versus intralumbar treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IT chemotherapy involves the injection of antitumor agents into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), either directly into the lateral ventricle through a subcutaneous reservoir and ventricular catheter (eg, an Ommaya device) or into the lumbar thecal sac by lumbar puncture (LP). If a ventricular catheter is placed, it is important to check for correct placement before chemotherapy is initiated, as administration of drug into the brain parenchyma may cause focal leukoencephalopathy. IT chemotherapy is more likely to be effective for small leptomeningeal deposits and individual tumor cells floating in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. It cannot reliably treat bulky disease, because diffusion of drug into tumor deposits thicker than 1 mm, along nerve root sleeves, and into the Virchow-Robin spaces is limited.</p><p>Intraventricular as opposed to intralumbar IT administration by LP offers several advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent LP is difficult for both the patient and clinician, and results in the inadvertent introduction of drug into the epidural or subdural space in as much as 10 percent of administrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even in the absence of obstruction to CSF flow, administration of chemotherapy via LP results in unpredictable drug concentrations in the ventricles and over the brain convexities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Drug levels in the ventricular CSF following LP are only one-tenth those achieved after an equivalent intraventricular dose. By contrast, administration through an Ommaya reservoir permits more uniform drug distribution throughout the neuraxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A survival benefit was suggested for intraventricular compared with lumbar IT chemotherapy by observational data, perhaps as a consequence of these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Others have suggested a progression-free survival benefit for intraventricular administration in patients treated with MTX. Ventricular administration was compared with lumbar administration in a subset analysis of a randomized trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-cytarabine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal cytarabine</a> with MTX in 100 patients with LM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Overall, IT chemotherapy was given into the ventricles in 72 percent of cases and by LP in 28 percent. For patients given liposomal cytarabine, there was no statistically significant difference based upon the route of administration. For those treated with IT MTX, the ventricular route appeared preferable (progression-free survival 19 versus 43 days, p = 0.048). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Liposomal cytarabine'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Whether the magnitude of these advantages is sufficient to outweigh the risks of surgery for reservoir placement and the increased risk of infection is unknown (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections of cerebrospinal fluid shunts and other devices&quot;</a>). Nevertheless, whenever possible, we recommend that IT chemotherapy be administered through a subcutaneous reservoir and ventricular catheter directly into the lateral ventricle (eg, an Ommaya device), rather than by LP. Repeat LP is required in patients who unable or unwilling to undergo surgical placement of a reservoir.</p><p>Limited data suggest that the complication rate of intraventricular reservoirs is low in patients with LM disease from solid tumors. In a single-center prospective study of 112 such patients treated with a mean of nine intraventricular chemotherapy injections each (mostly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-cytarabine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal cytarabine</a>), the overall catheter-related complication rate was 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There were seven infections; of these, three occurred within 30 days of surgery and four were likely related to access of the reservoir for chemotherapy injection. All affected patients presented with a febrile meningeal syndrome, and bacterial meningitis was confirmed in the majority; one case was fatal. Less common complications of the reservoir included focal leukoencephalopathy along the catheter in the right frontal lobe requiring removal of the device (n = 2) and intraventricular hemorrhage in a patient on oral anticoagulation (n = 1). An earlier retrospective review of intraventricular reservoir placement in 107 patients reported similar results, with 19 complications; 10 related to placement (including two infections and two fatal hemorrhages) and 9 related to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, eight patients developed symptomatic elevated intracranial pressure (ICP; range 0.5 to 11 months after reservoir placement) that required conversion to ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique of drug administration into the CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful attention to minimizing any change in CSF volume with IT therapy is critical. Serious complications (eg, headache, nausea and vomiting, obtundation, herniation) can develop acutely if the total volume is increased even in asymptomatic patients with LM, because they may be on the edge of their CSF ventricular compliance (&quot;pressure-volume&quot;) curve. Thus, equivalent volumes of CSF (usually 7 to 10 mL) should be removed prior to instilling IT chemotherapy.</p><p>Conversely, decreases in CSF volume can cause patients to develop a pressure sensation (usually frontal or retroorbital) during the withdrawal of large volumes of CSF from the ventricles. This sensation disappears promptly after fluid is replaced during the chemotherapy infusion and is less common if the procedure is performed with the patient supine.</p><p>Administration of intraventricular chemotherapy follows a standard procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91667\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef91667 \">movie 1</a>). After sterile preparation of the skin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a>, a 23-gauge butterfly needle attached to a three-way stopcock is inserted into the ventricular reservoir. Approximately 15 to 20 mL of CSF are then withdrawn gradually over two to five minutes (depending upon patient tolerance) into syringes no larger than 10 mL. Syringes should be partially opened and closed prior to their attachment to the stopcock. The first 10 mL syringe is left attached to the stopcock and is used to flush the chemotherapy through the butterfly needle and Ommaya catheter following drug administration. The remaining CSF is sent for cytology and other studies.</p><p>Once the CSF has been withdrawn, the syringe containing the drug is attached to a stopcock port.
