AVR offers substantial improvements in symptoms and life expectancy. Medical therapy may not prolong life in patients with AS and has limited utility in treating symptoms.</p><p>In patients who are candidates for surgical intervention and are awaiting surgery, medical therapy to optimize hemodynamics in the pre-operative setting may be needed. However, when severe symptoms are present, it may be prudent to admit the patient to the hospital and perform surgery urgently, as there is a high risk of cardiac death once severe symptoms are present.</p><p>Longer-term palliative medical management of symptomatic AS is appropriate for patients who are not candidates for aortic valve surgery due to coexisting medical conditions and in patients who have refused AVR. Transcatheter AVI (TAVI) allows intervention in some patients who are at too high risk to undergo surgical AVR, but in others, TAVI may not be possible due to anatomic factors or may be futile due to a high level of comorbidities or frailty. </p><p>This topic will discuss medical management of patients with symptomatic AS and possible indications for aortic valvuloplasty. Indications for AVR, surgical and transcatheter methods of AVR, and management of asymptomatic AS are discussed separately.

Some of these patients may be candidates for transcatheter aortic valve implantation but others may not be able to undergo transcatheter AVI (TAVI) due to anatomic reasons (annulus size, vascular access, etc) or the potential benefit of TAVI may be low due to a high level of comorbidities or frailty.

Of concern are reports that substantial numbers of patients with symptomatic AS with reasonable estimated operative risks are not referred for aortic valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Most medical interventions carry the risk of destabilizing the patient. Patients with the onset of mild symptoms may be scheduled electively for valve replacement. However, those with frank heart failure, angina, or syncope should be hospitalized while awaiting valve replacement. The management of critically ill patients is discussed below.

In contrast, when valve replacement is not possible or is refused by the patient, medical therapy may not prolong life and has potential harm. The goals of medical therapy are to treat concurrent cardiovascular conditions, prevent or treat superimposed diseases that often exacerbate the effects of valve obstruction, maintain optimal loading conditions, and treat symptoms. In addition, the physician should provide both the patient and family counseling about the expected disease course, treatment options, and end-of-life preferences.</p><p>No endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated for patients with AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Adults with symptomatic severe AS should engage in only mild physical activity, as symptoms will be precipitated by even moderate physical exertion. Patients with symptomatic severe AS should not participate in competitive sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Since patients with calcific aortic valve disease commonly have concurrent atherosclerotic disease, including coronary artery disease, evaluation for and management of associated cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hyperlipidemia) is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of asymptomatic aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Coronary artery disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At present, statin therapy solely to treat or prevent progression of AS (ie, in the absence of coexisting atherosclerotic vascular disease or other indications) cannot be recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of asymptomatic aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevention of disease progression'</a>.)</p><p>Medical therapy for coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation should be continued in adults with AS, both in those with and without symptoms. An appropriate goal for patients with atrial fibrillation is rate control with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of asymptomatic aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of loading conditions and symptoms</span></p><p>Even in the absence of an acute illness, adults with severe symptomatic inoperable AS may have fewer symptoms and less frequent hospitalizations if loading conditions can be optimized. This includes treatment of hypertension and maintaining a normal volume status.</p><p>Treatment of hypertension in severe symptomatic AS is challenging. Concomitant hypertension and AS present a double load for the left ventricle (LV), which may adversely affect ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The combination of hypertension and AS may lead to development of symptoms as an earlier stage of AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, no specific treatment regimen for patients with AS with hypertension has been established.</p><p>Various medical therapies pose a risk of destabilizing the patient with AS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics reduce preload, on which the patient may depend for maintenance of cardiac output. Therefore, diuretics should be used with caution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers reduce contractility, which may pose a risk for the overloaded LV. While low dose beta blockers may be considered in patients with asymptomatic hypertension (particularly in the setting of atrial fibrillation), beta blockers should be avoided in patients with symptomatic AS and heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasodilators (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>) in the presence of a fixed valvular stenosis may reduce systemic blood pressure and reduce coronary artery perfusion pressure. These agents should be avoided or used with caution. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Critically ill patients awaiting valve replacement'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Despite these concerns, cautious treatment of hypertension starting with low doses and titrating slowly as needed to optimize loading conditions is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used by some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since experience in AS patients is limited, calcium channel blockers should be used with caution.</p><p>For management of patients who have had symptoms of heart failure, we suggest a combination of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor. These should be started at low doses with gradual titration.</p><p>Treatment is improved if patients are educated and involved in following daily weights and signs of decompensation. In addition, patients should be educated about the effects of sodium intake, changes in elevation with travel, and other factors that may lead to clinical decompensation. Frequent physician or nurse visits are needed for patient monitoring.</p><p>Even with optimal care, adults with severe symptomatic inoperable AS will have exacerbations of symptoms and frequent hospitalizations. Symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain are treated as described above, within the end-of-life care parameters set by the patient. Dizziness and pre-syncope typically are exertional and can be avoided by decreasing physical activity and instructing the patient to stop and sit (or lie) down when symptoms occur. Palliative care includes symptomatic treatment for symptoms of dyspnea and angina. In addition, end-of-life discussions and counseling are appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care for patients with advanced heart failure: Indications and strategies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention and treatment of concurrent conditions</span></p><p>Many adults with severe symptomatic AS have relatively stable symptoms with decompensation triggered by an intercurrent illness such as influenza, anemia, pulmonary embolism, etc. Optimal preventative care can prevent recurrent hospitalizations. These measures include pneumococcal vaccination, annual influenza vaccination, routine preventative care examinations, and treatment of any noncardiac conditions.</p><p>When clinical decompensation occurs, in addition to treating the disease process, patients may be effectively managed by supportive care during the acute illness. Medical therapy focuses on decreasing cardiac workload by reducing fever, controlling heart rate and blood pressure, correction of anemia, and administration of oxygen. Volume status should be carefully monitored with cautious replacement of fluid or gentle diuresis, as needed. With severe AS, patients are very sensitive to small changes in preload, often called a &quot;narrow preload window.&quot; An increase in LV volume in a stiff hypertrophied LV results in a rapid rise in diastolic pressure and symptoms of pulmonary congestion. Conversely, when filling volumes are too low, the small LV does not fill adequately with a fall in forward stroke volume and signs of low output failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22998847\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical management in patients awaiting aortic valve replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, medical intervention prior to AVR should be minimized in patients with severe or symptomatic AS. Most medical interventions carry the risk of destabilizing the patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics reduce preload, on which the patient may depend for maintenance of cardiac output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasodilators in the presence of a fixed valvular stenosis may reduce systemic blood pressure and reduce coronary artery perfusion pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive inotropic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> must be used with caution; tachycardia (with reduced cardiac output) and myocardial ischemia (due to increased oxygen demand) may occur.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Critically ill patients awaiting valve replacement</span></p><p>Some critically ill patients with AS are hemodynamically unstable prior to surgery and at high risk for mortality during the procedure. This is especially true in patients with LV dysfunction, who may present with heart failure, and those with coronary disease, who may present with unstable angina. It would be desirable to stabilize such patients prior to transcatheter or surgical valve replacement, but these are precisely the patients at highest risk of further decompensation with injudicious medical intervention.</p><p>Percutaneous balloon dilation may reduce the aortic valve gradient and can potentially improve symptoms prior to AVR. However, this procedure is associated with high morbidity and only transient efficacy. This was illustrated by a series of 21 patients with AS and cardiogenic shock who underwent balloon dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After the procedure, there were significant increases in mean aortic pressure (from 77 to 116 mmHg), aortic valve area (from 0.48 to 0.84 cm<sup>2</sup>), and the cardiac index (from 1.84 to 2.24). However, nine of the patients died in the hospital during or after the procedure. In addition, vascular complications occurred in five patients, and stroke, cholesterol emboli, and aortic regurgitation occurred in one patient each.</p><p>Because of these limitations, balloon dilation should be considered only in selected clinical settings. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Possible indications for aortic balloon dilation'</a> below.)</p><p>Although data are limited, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> may be useful in improving ventricular performance prior to surgery in an attempt to reduce surgical risk. The use of nitroprusside was evaluated in a study of 25 patients with severe AS and depressed LV function who were not hypotensive; nitroprusside was administered during continuous hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. During nitroprusside treatment, there were significant increases in cardiac index (1.60 to 2.52 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> per m<sup>2</sup>) and stroke volume (from 32 to 54 mL) and significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (81 to 69 mmHg) and systemic vascular resistance. Five patients died in the hospital and 13 underwent successful AVR.</p><p>Although no complications occurred, the use of vasodilator therapy in such patients is associated with a risk of hypotension and hemodynamic collapse, and it is unclear from this uncontrolled study whether the surgical outcomes were improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This approach should be undertaken only with careful hemodynamic monitoring by experienced clinicians.</p><p>A potential alternative approach is use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> in such patients, although use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> or dobutamine in critically ill patients with AS requires intensive monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE INDICATIONS FOR AORTIC BALLOON DILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous aortic balloon dilation (previously termed percutaneous aortic balloon valvotomy) is a procedure in which one or more balloons are placed across the stenotic aortic valve and inflated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The aim is to relieve the stenosis, presumably by fracturing calcific deposits within the valve leaflets. Stretching of the annulus and separation of the calcified commissures also may contribute. Early changes after successful balloon dilation include a moderate reduction in the transvalvular pressure gradient and an often dramatic improvement in symptoms; however, the post-procedure valve area rarely exceeds 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Serious complications (stroke, aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction) occur in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Furthermore, restenosis and clinical deterioration occur in most cases within 6 to 12 months and the long-term outcome resembles the natural history of untreated AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. Repeat balloon dilation can be performed, but most patients fail within six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Based upon these observations, the 2014 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines recommend that balloon aortic dilation may be considered as a bridge to transcatheter or surgical AVR in patients with severe symptomatic AS, although moving directly to transcatheter AVR also is an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, balloon dilation is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for valve replacement in adults, although selected young adults without valve calcification may represent an exception&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, balloon dilation is frequently used in children with valvar AS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar aortic stenosis in children&quot;, section on 'First-line treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease#H3886180\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of adults with bicuspid aortic valve disease&quot;, section on 'Role of balloon valvotomy'</a>.)</p><p>Although the evidence is not well established, the guidelines noted two specific settings in adults in which balloon dilation might be reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a bridge to transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) in hemodynamically unstable patients who are at high risk for AVR.

Although there are case reports suggesting success, balloon dilation can induce aortic regurgitation even in experienced hands, the postdilation bicuspid aortic valve remains susceptible to infective endocarditis irrespective of its functional state, the ascending aorta still harbors an abnormal media, and recurrent stenosis is common within 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-a-bicuspid-aortic-valve\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with a bicuspid aortic valve&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who require urgent noncardiac surgery. However, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines concluded that most asymptomatic patients with severe AS can undergo urgent noncardiac surgery at relatively low risk with careful intraoperative and postoperative management, including monitoring of anesthesia and careful attention to fluid balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,18</a>]. Balloon dilation was not recommended; AVR should be considered if preoperative correction of AS is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

It can and does include end-of-life planning and care, but is meant to be initiated earlier in the course of illness. Palliative care is partly founded on the principles of shared decision making, and its practitioners are highly skilled at ascertaining patients&rsquo; views and preferences and helping the patients and family understand how various medical options will or will not facilitate the patient in reaching their goals of care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The principles outlined in reviews and position papers on palliative care and decision making in advanced heart failure apply as well to patients with severe AS who have concomitant heart failure, who are elderly and frail, or who have other chronic conditions that may limit their prognosis with or without surgical or percutaneous valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-symptomatic-aortic-stenosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

These providers can facilitate ascertainment of patients&rsquo; goals and preferences, assess patient knowledge and understanding of their disease, and discuss prognosis and foreseeable outcomes with medical options. In many of these patients, TAVI will either not be advisable, or the patients themselves will decide against it as being unlikely to help them achieve their goals. For example, if the patient&rsquo;s goals are to improve cognitive function, mobility, and independence, TAVI may not help significantly with these goals. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

However, medical management may be required in patients who are not candidates for surgery (either due to comorbid conditions or patient refusal to undergo valve replacement). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Settings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care for severe symptomatic inoperable AS includes the following (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of concurrent cardiovascular conditions such as atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Management of loading conditions and symptoms. Careful treatment of hypertension is appropriate. For patients with heart failure, we suggest a combination of a diuretic and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.
