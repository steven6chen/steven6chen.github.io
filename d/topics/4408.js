As a result, the care of older patients constitutes an important part of the everyday practice for the adult oncologist.</p><p>Despite the high incidence of cancer in this group, older patients have been underrepresented in clinical trials that set the standards for care in oncology practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Less data exist regarding the risks and benefits of cancer treatment in this population, and there are few guidelines that specifically address the evaluation and treatment of the older patient.</p><p>Older patients are less likely to receive all types of standard cancer therapies compared with younger individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. Possible reasons include concerns regarding increased toxicity, competing causes of morbidity and mortality, lack of access to care, and clinician or patient preference.</p><p>Chronologic age alone provides relatively little information regarding an individual's tolerance to cancer treatment. Among patients of the same age, there is wide heterogeneity in the ability to undergo aggressive therapy.</p><p>Identifiable comorbid conditions and organ-specific physiologic changes due to aging can limit a patient's ability to tolerate cancer therapy. In addition, the aging process can be associated with decreased physiologic reserve affecting multiple systems. This can be manifested as frailty and can interfere with the functional status of the patient, even in the absence of specific comorbidities. The manifestations of frailty include various components of weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, relative immobility, and a general decrease in physical activity.</p><p>There is a need to identify the seemingly frail older individual who is likely to benefit from and tolerate standard therapy, as well as the seemingly fit older individual who is apt to experience undue side effects and requires a modified treatment plan. The evaluation of frailty in older adults (clinical and potential physiologic predictors) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive in elderly adults: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Frailty'</a>.)</p><p>Information about specific issues may guide interventions that can improve the ability to undergo cancer treatment. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) looking at all of the factors that can influence the outcome of therapy is useful in addressing these needs.</p><p>The key components of a CGA as applied to patients with cancer will be reviewed here, along with the different approaches for obtaining this information. A more detailed discussion of the CGA, general aspects of the treatment of cancer in the older adult patients, and the management of older adult patients with specific types of cancer are presented separately.

However, although a CGA is helpful for clinicians to develop a coordinated plan for cancer treatment and to guide appropriate interventions for specific problems, it can be time consuming and may not be practical for all patients. Nevertheless, in our practice, we utilize a CGA in every patient age 65 and older, using a mainly self-administered CGA assessment tool, as described in more detail below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Multiple approaches have been made to develop &quot;simplified CGAs&quot; (assessment of autonomy, malnutrition, depression, cognition, and comorbidity), which are intended to be quick screening tools to determine who could benefit from a full CGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].&nbsp;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abbreviated CGA was developed by performing a retrospective chart review of 500 patients who underwent a geriatric assessment consisting of an evaluation of functional status (Activities of Daily Living [ADLs] and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living [IADLs]), cognition (MMSE), and psychological state (Geriatric Depression Scale). The authors identified 15 items from these scales that demonstrated the highest item to total correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another alternative tool is the Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73154\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73154 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. This approach utilizes a function-based scoring system that considers age, self-rated health, physical limitations, and functional disabilities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other instruments include the French G8 tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and the Flemish version of the Triage Risk Screening Tool (fTRST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. One group used both tools to screen 937 patients aged 70 or older with a malignant tumor and a new cancer event requiring a treatment decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Both tools showed high sensitivity for detecting patients with a geriatric risk profile (as determined by formal geriatric assessment, which was carried out in all patients) and were prognostic for functional decline during therapy and higher mortality rates. </p><p/><p>All frailty screening methods, including the VES-13, have a limited power to predict outcome of a CGA. A systematic review of several frailty screening methods, including the VES-13, concluded that they all had limited specificity and that the negative predictive value of the most sensitive screening tool was only 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Nevertheless, a prospective study of 1021 patients with cancer evaluated four frailty tools (Balducci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], SIOG 1 and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>], and Ferrat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]) and found that each had good prognostic ability to predict six-month unscheduled admissions and one-year mortality, suggesting that such tools may be helpful in decision-making regarding cancer treatments in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frailty#H2928682558\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frailty&quot;, section on 'Instruments developed to assess frailty'</a>.)</p><p>These tools are not intended to be a CGA or replace the need for one. They do not really identify issues that can be followed up specifically to try to improve outcomes. While they have been used for prognostication and probably work almost as well as a full CGA for that, they do not substitute for a CGA for all purposes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DOMAINS OF A CGA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical domains of a CGA include evaluations of functional status, comorbid medical conditions, cognitive status, psychological state, social support, nutritional status, and a review of the medication list.</p><p>Impaired functional status and significant comorbidity can have significant effects on the ability to administer systemic chemotherapy in the older adult patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in elderly persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional status refers to a patient's ability to perform routine daily tasks. The commonly used performance status scores (eg, Karnofsky or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scales (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 3</a>)) tend to underrepresent the degree of functional impairment in the older patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>A more comprehensive understanding of an older patient's functional state can be obtained by the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales. ADLs are the skills that are necessary for basic living, and include feeding, grooming, transferring, and toileting. IADLs are required to live independently in the community and include activities such as shopping, managing finances, housekeeping, preparing meals, and taking medications. In a study of 363 cancer patients aged &ge;65 years, an ECOG performance status &lt;2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 3</a>) was associated with limitations of ADL and IADL in 9 and 38 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The frequency of IADL limitations was more common in patients aged &ge;80 years.</p><p>Functional disability is common in older patients with cancer. This was illustrated by a national sample of 9745 community-based Medicare beneficiaries, in which older adults with cancer had more limitations in ADLs, IADLs, and greater health care utilization than individuals without cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Similar results were seen in another study of 303 patients aged &ge;65 years with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies, in which limitations in ADLs and IADLs were found in 17 and 59 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>The impact of functional status on the overall survival of older patients with cancer was illustrated by a study of 566 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer age &ge;70 years receiving chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this study, improved overall survival was associated with independence in performing IADLs (p = 0.04) and higher quality of life (p = 0.0003) scores. Limitations in basic ADLs and the presence of comorbidity were not predictors of a decrease in overall survival.</p><p>Impaired functional status is associated with an increased risk of toxicity due to chemotherapy. This was demonstrated in two multicenter studies that identified predictors of chemotherapy toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In both of these studies, the patient&rsquo;s functional status was a key predictor. </p><p>In the study by the Cancer and Aging Research Group, the functional measures that predicted chemotherapy toxicity risk included falls in the last six months, limitations in walking one block, need for assistance with taking medications, and decreased social activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients (CRASH) score identified the need for assistance with IADLs as a predictor of chemotherapy toxicity. Another study of patients aged &ge;70 years with ovarian cancer who were receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> identified functional dependence (defined as living at home with assistance or living with medical assistance in a specialized institution) and ECOG performance status &ge;2 as predictors of chemotherapy toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comorbidity represents the extent of an individual's physical and psychological disease in addition to the disease for which he or she is seeking treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. As an individual ages, the number of comorbid medical conditions increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The impact of these comorbid medical conditions on life expectancy and treatment tolerance should be considered when estimating the risks and benefits of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The importance of comorbidity is illustrated by analyses from three large series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A longitudinal observational study of 936 women with breast cancer ages 40 to 84 found that patients who had three or more comorbid medical conditions had a 20-fold higher rate of mortality from causes other than breast cancer and a four-fold higher all-cause mortality rate compared with those who had no comorbid medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second report analyzed 1255 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were enrolled in two randomized trials conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Patients at least 65 years of age were significantly more likely to have a Charlson Comorbidity Index score &ge;1 than younger patients (42 versus 26 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72047 \">table 4</a>). Although age was not an independent factor influencing survival, comorbidity, as evidenced by a Charlson Comorbidity Index score &ge;1, was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study analyzed the impact of comorbidity using three different instruments in a series of 496 patients (mean age, 67 years) undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Analysis using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the National Institute on Aging and National Cancer Institute Comorbidity Index, and the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 all found that patients with the highest comorbidity burden had the poorest overall and colon cancer-specific survival.</p><p/><p>In addition to its effect on survival, the presence of comorbid medical conditions also affects a patient's ability to tolerate cancer therapy. In a study of patients aged &ge;70 years with advanced non&ndash;small cell lung cancer, for example, those with a Charlson Comorbidity Index of &ge;2 were more likely to discontinue chemotherapy early than patients with a comorbidity score &lt;2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>An assessment of comorbid medical conditions can provide information that is independent of the individual's functional status. This was illustrated by a study of 203 older patients with cancer, in whom there was little or no correlation between comorbidity (as measured by either the Charlson Comorbidity Index or Cumulative Illness Rating Scale &ndash; Geriatric) and functional status (as assessed by ECOG performance status or ADLs). Thus it is important to assess comorbidity as well as functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive function is another important component of the overall assessment of the geriatric patient with cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the general geriatric population, dementia is an independent prognostic factor for survival. The presence of dementia influences the likelihood of both cancer diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In a population cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Medicare database, patients with invasive colon cancer and dementia were more likely to have a cancer diagnosis reported after death based upon either an autopsy or death certificate than patients who did not have dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In addition, patients with dementia were less likely to have a biopsy-proven diagnosis of cancer and were less likely to receive surgery or chemotherapy. In another study using the SEER database, patients with Alzheimer disease and breast cancer were more likely to be diagnosed with a later stage of breast cancer and were less likely to receive treatment for their malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>From a practical standpoint, an assessment of cognitive status is important prior to beginning chemotherapy treatment in order to ensure that the patient can comply with instructions regarding supportive medications or oral chemotherapy, and in order to understand and remember to seek medical attention if side effects develop.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional status is an important prognostic factor in all geriatric patients.

The importance of weight loss was illustrated by a study of 4714 community-dwelling adults age &ge;65 years, in which weight loss &ge;5 percent was associated with an increased risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Similar results were seen in another study of 7527 individuals age &ge;70 years, in which a BMI &lt;19.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (the lowest 10 percent of the population) was associated with an increased risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Among patients with cancer, the deleterious effect of weight loss on survival was demonstrated in a study of 3047 patients enrolled in 12 ECOG chemotherapy protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In this analysis, weight loss was an independent prognostic factor for survival and was associated with a lower performance status. Furthermore, weight loss was associated with a decrease in chemotherapy response rates in women with breast cancer, although this correlation was not present in other tumor types. Even a limited weight loss (0 to 5 percent) can be clinically significant in patients with cancer.</p><p>Thus, the adverse effects of weight loss and low BMI have been demonstrated in all older patients including those with cancer. Future studies are needed to determine whether nutritional intervention can decrease these risks.

This was illustrated in a survey of 6649 patients aged &gt;70 years, in which the presence of increasing numbers of depressive symptoms was associated with a need for more hours of informal caregiving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>The patients who are most vulnerable to psychological distress are those with inadequate social support. This was illustrated by a study of breast cancer survivors, in which older age was associated with less distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, patients with less adequate social support experienced increased distress. In addition, social isolation is also an independent predictor of mortality in the geriatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication review</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For older patients with cancer, careful review of medications is an important component of a CGA. Regular and comprehensive review of all medications (both prescription and over the counter) is needed to remove any unnecessary or potentially inappropriate medications and to assess for potential drug interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. As an example, the diagnosis of terminal cancer should prompt the discontinuation of certain drugs that are no longer potentially beneficial, such as lipid-lowering medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Physiologic changes associated with aging can have a major impact on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. With aging, body fat increases, total body water and renal function decrease, and hepatic mass and blood flow decrease. In addition, the number of medications that an individual takes also increases. This combination of age-related changes in physiology and polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events in the older patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Older adults with cancer are particularly prone to medication errors attributed to medication changes, complex regimens, and incomplete information handoff between providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Cancer-related therapy adds to the use of multiple medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the consumption of potentially inappropriate medications and compounds the risk for adverse drug effects, drug-drug interactions, and nonadherence as a result of increased pill burden and regimen complexity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. In one pharmacist-led medication review of 248 ambulatory senior adults with cancer who were receiving a geriatric oncology assessment over an 18-month period, the mean number of medications used was 9.23, and 43 percent were receiving more than 10 medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use (as assessed by 2012 Beers criteria, Screening Tool of Older Person&rsquo;s Prescriptions [STOPP], and the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS]) was 51 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'Inappropriate medications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OBTAINING PATIENT DATA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although consensus guidelines recommend that older patients with cancer undergo a CGA, there is no consensus regarding an optimal tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/31,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,81</a>]. The various approaches that have been studied recognize the limited resources available in an oncology practice, and several different methods of obtaining this information have been explored. These screening tools can potentially identify older adults who would benefit from a more thorough evaluation or collaborative care with a geriatrician. Here we will briefly review several assessment methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Mailed CGA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A self-reported, mailed CGA was evaluated in a population of male oncology patients (mean age 68, range 42 to 87) at the Durham, North Carolina Veterans Administration Medical Center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The assessment evaluated functional status, pain, financial wellbeing, social support, psychological state, spiritual wellbeing, and quality of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60695\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60695 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>The CGA was sent to participants prior to their initial clinic visit, and 76 percent of patients kept their clinic visit and returned the assessment. The mailed CGA was effective in capturing salient information about the different assessment domains. For example, 58 percent of patients required assistance with one or more instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), 61 percent required assistance with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), the mean number of comorbid medical conditions was five, and the mean number of medications was six.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-administered CGA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Investigators from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), Cancer in the Elderly Committee, developed a CGA that is primarily self-administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This assessment is a compilation of well-validated instruments that evaluate functional status, comorbidity, cognition, nutritional status, psychological state, social support, and medication use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70657\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70657 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>Three of the instruments are performed by the healthcare provider: the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test (a measure of cognition), Timed Up and Go (a performance-based measure of functional status), and Karnofsky performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a>). The remainder of the assessment is self-administered by the patient.</p><p>Pilot data demonstrate that the mean time to complete the assessment is 27 minutes, and 78 percent of participants could complete the self-administered portion on their own. Overall, 90 percent of participants were satisfied with the length of the questionnaire, 83 percent reported that it was easy to understand, and 100 percent stated that there were no upsetting items [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The CALGB, Cancer in the Elderly Committee evaluated the feasibility of including this primarily self-administered assessment in CALGB trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The median time to complete the geriatric assessment tool was 22 minutes. The majority (87 percent) of patients completed the assessment without assistance. Furthermore, patient satisfaction with the questionnaire was high (92 percent reported satisfaction with the questionnaire length, 95 percent reported no difficult questions, and 96 percent reported no upsetting questions). The assessment met the feasibility criteria specified in the protocol for inclusion in future cooperative group studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical interview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A third approach, using a clinical interview for the CGA, was evaluated in 30 patients aged 65 and older with a variety of tumor types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The Multidimensional Assessment Protocol for Cancer (MACE) includes an evaluation of the socioeconomic status, cognitive status, depression, physical performance, disability, and tumor characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70602 \">table 7</a>).

However, despite the absence of randomized trials showing that routine geriatric assessment impacts outcomes or influences treatment decision-making in older patients with cancer, we suggest a CGA for every oncology patient age 65 and older (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
