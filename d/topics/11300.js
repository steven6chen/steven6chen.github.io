Anesthesia clinicians must monitor patient physiologic variables and anesthesia equipment during all types of anesthesia, as anesthesia and surgery can cause rapid changes in vital functions. Patient and equipment monitoring is used to titrate administration of anesthetic medication, to detect physiologic perturbations and allow intervention before the patient suffers harm, and to detect and correct equipment malfunction.</p><p>This topic will discuss the basic monitors used during anesthesia. Neuromonitoring during anesthesia and surgery, transesophageal echocardiography, monitoring of neuromuscular function, monitoring to prevent awareness during anesthesia, and pulmonary artery catheter monitoring are discussed separately.

Standard ASA monitors applied to the patient include a pulse oximeter, electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure device, and a temperature monitor. In addition, the ASA monitoring standards include measurement of end tidal carbon dioxide, inspired oxygen concentration, and the use of low oxygen concentration and ventilator disconnect alarms. Quantitative monitoring of the volume of expired gas is strongly encouraged by the ASA. According to the ASA standards for monitoring, continual monitoring is defined as measurement repeated regularly and frequently in steady, rapid succession (eg, automatic noninvasive blood pressure measurement), whereas continuous monitoring is that which is prolonged, without interruption (eg, ECG monitoring). </p><p>The standards for monitoring during anesthesia created by international anesthesia organizations are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114602 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. All of these standards state that the most important monitor is the presence of an anesthesia clinician throughout anesthesia, and include statements that a blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, and end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitor should be used during anesthesia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1289396269\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING MODALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3819130995\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinician monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical monitoring using visual inspection, auscultation, and palpation is a primary determinant of patient safety. Changes in clinical signs may be subtle, and often precede abnormalities in parameters measured by monitoring devices. Monitoring devices do not replace clinical observation; rather, they amplify and quantify clinical information (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110080 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254403446\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory system monitoring</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2430303370\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxygenation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1259097955\"><span class=\"h4\">Cyanosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical assessment of hypoxemia judged by perioral cyanosis is known to be notoriously unreliable. Many factors such as natural skin pigment, room lighting, interobserver variation, and hemoglobin concentration can affect detection of cyanosis. Approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> of unoxygenated hemoglobin in the capillaries generates the dark blue color appreciated clinically as cyanosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, this threshold may occur at varying levels of arterial oxygen saturation and arterial hemoglobin content, as shown in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114333\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114333 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3626630730\"><span class=\"h4\">Pulse oximetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse oximetry is a quantitative method of assessing oxygenation that should be used when possible during all anesthetics, and is part of the World Health Organization preoperative safe surgery checklist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If pulse oximetry cannot be used during induction of anesthesia (eg, in small children, with uncooperative adults), the monitor should be attached as soon as consciousness is lost and the reason for the delay should be recorded in the anesthesia record. Importantly, the variable pitch pulse tone and the low threshold alarm should be audible to the anesthesia clinician. </p><p>The principles of pulse oximetry, equipment, accuracy, and sources of error are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107546 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry#H1290945654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;, section on 'Probes'</a>.)</p><p>In the operating room, pulse oximeters are commonly placed on the finger or earlobe in adults, and on the <span class=\"nowrap\">foot/ankle</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">wrist/palm</span> in infants, to shine light through tissue and detect it on the other side. Newer forehead probes use reflectance technology to measure back scattered rather than transmitted light. The response time to changes in oxygen saturation is faster with forehead and ear probes than with finger probes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry#H1290945654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;, section on 'Probes'</a>.)</p><p>Most pulse oximeters display a plethysmographic (pleth) waveform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107547\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107547 \">figure 2</a>). The practical purpose of displaying the pleth waveform is to verify good probe placement and function. In commercially available pulse oximeters, the waveform is only processed to determine heart rate. Most pulse oximeter monitors display an indicator of the quality of the signal; a good signal indicates that the oximeter is working. </p><p>The pleth waveform resembles an intraarterial wave form, and advanced analysis may similarly provide additional clinical information. One specialized monitor incorporates an algorithm to measure changes in the pulse volume continuously, to determine the plethysmographic variability index (PVI). The PVI is a measure of the dynamic changes in the perfusion index over respiratory cycles, with the goal of predicting fluid responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=novel-tools-for-hemodynamic-monitoring-in-critically-ill-patients-with-shock#H4126637658\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Novel tools for hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill patients with shock&quot;, section on 'Pulse contour analysis (fluid responsiveness)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-fluid-management#H626508222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative fluid management&quot;, section on 'Goal-directed fluid therapy'</a>.) </p><p>The utility of the PVI for predicting intraoperative fluid responsiveness is unclear. A meta-analysis of 10 small studies that compared PVI with cardiac output or stroke volume based measures of fluid responsiveness found that PVI was reasonably accurate at predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. PVI is not reliable in patients with atrial fibrillation or arrhythmias, and is affected by changes in peripheral perfusion (eg, use of vasoconstrictors, or cold extremities). </p><p>Respiratory variation in pulse volume changes with ordinary pulse oximeters are rarely visible, and are a crude and late indicator of massive hypovolemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2019490258\"><span class=\"h4\">Inspired oxygen analyzer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During every general anesthetic employing an anesthesia machine, an oxygen analyzer should be used to ensure that a hypoxic mixture of gases is not delivered. The analyzer is calibrated by exposure to air (21 percent oxygen [O<sub>2</sub>]) and 100 percent O<sub>2</sub>, and should read 21 percent before each anesthetic when open to room air. O<sub>2</sub> analyzers usually have a low-level alarm that is automatically activated by turning on the anesthesia machine. The sensor should be placed into the inspiratory or expiratory limb of the breathing circuit and not into the fresh gas flow, to ensure measurement of the concentration actually delivered, rather than the dialed concentration. &#160; </p><p>Most modern anesthesia gas analyzers incorporate methods allowing simultaneous measurement of concentrations of at least O<sub>2</sub>, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and the inhalation agent. Non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy is usually employed, and gas analyzers that measure oxygen utilize ancillary technologies such as paramagnetic or fuel-cell sensors in conjunction with the infrared sensor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Awareness with recall following general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'End-tidal anesthetic concentration'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2989270694\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequacy of ventilation should be continuously monitored in all patients during anesthesia, including observation of clinical signs such as chest excursion, auscultation of breath sounds (using a precordial or esophageal stethoscope), and movement of the reservoir bag. Patients who are breathing spontaneously should be observed for signs of airway obstruction, including a tracheal tug, paradoxical chest movement, snoring, or upper airway sounds.</p><p>During anesthesia without sedation (ie, regional or local anesthesia without sedation), clinical observation may be adequate for monitoring ventilation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875814525\"><span class=\"h4\">Capnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most anesthesia machines are capable of providing an exhaled capnograph, which is a graph that shows the respiratory rate and the concentration of carbon dioxide over time, as well as the end tidal carbon dioxide concentration (ETCO<sub>2</sub>). Capnography should be used to assess the adequacy of ventilation for all patients who undergo sedation or general anesthesia, if possible. Capnography should also be used to confirm correct placement of an endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principles of operation of exhaled carbon dioxide monitors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;, section on 'Principles of operation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;, section on 'CO2 Waveform'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most CO<sub>2</sub> analyzers used in the operating room sample gas via a sidestream mechanism. This means that the CO<sub>2</sub> sensor is part of the anesthesia machine, and gas is aspirated through sampling tubing connected to the patient breathing circuit. Sample tubing may be six or more feet long, and there may be a several second delay before appearance of the CO<sub>2</sub> trace after a breath. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phases of the normal capnogram are shown in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67700 \">figure 3</a>). The continuous wave form allows a visual breath to breath assessment of the patient&rsquo;s airway and ventilation. Changes of the shape of the capnogram can be the result of patient factors (eg, small or large airway obstruction, intrinsic lung disease, or ventilatory effort), equipment malfunction (eg, breathing circuit leak), or surgical manipulation. Examples of normal and abnormal capnograms are shown in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114177\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114177 \">figure 4</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, when square wave capnography is preserved during mechanical ventilation, </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A sudden drop in ETCO<sub>2</sub> suggests a sudden drop in lung perfusion caused by either an obstruction to blood flow through the lungs (thrombus, air, or fat) or a reduction in cardiac output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Steady increase in ETCO<sub>2</sub> suggests hypoventilation or very rarely malignant hyperthermia if associated with rise in temperature. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Correlation with PaCO2 &mdash; </strong>The ETCO<sub>2</sub> is a non-invasive estimate of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration or partial pressure in the arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is based on the assumption that end-tidal gas is primarily alveolar gas and alveolar CO<sub>2</sub> tension (PACO<sub>2</sub>) is virtually identical to pulmonary end-capillary tension, which in turn is identical to PaCO<sub>2</sub>. The PACO<sub>2</sub>-PETCO<sub>2</sub> gradient in a healthy patient with normal lungs is less than 5 mmHg and represents dilution of alveolar gas with CO<sub>2</sub>-free gas from non-perfused alveoli (alveolar dead space) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The difference is increased if there is a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> of the lungs, as seen in patients with lung disease, pulmonary emboli, low-cardiac output states, and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but may also be variably increased because of advanced age, and with surgical positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. For this reason, PaCO<sub>2</sub> should be measured when close control of ventilation is necessary (eg, patients with increased intracranial pressure). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with obstructive lung disease and an upsloping end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> plateau, inspiration may occur before the true end of expiration, and result in a falsely low ETCO<sub>2</sub> (in addition to predisposing to dynamic hyperinflation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112619\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112619 \">figure 5</a>). Reducing the respiratory rate (or briefly stopping the ventilator) should allow full exhalation and an accurate ETCO<sub>2</sub> reading.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1859086296\"><span class=\"h4\">Measurement of pulmonary mechanics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most newer anesthesia machines provide the capability to continuously monitor inspiratory and expiratory volumes, pressures, and flow and to display pressure volume loops and flow volume loops. The use of these parameters to optimize ventilator settings, and to monitor changes in pulmonary mechanics are discussed separately.

However, for practical reasons pressure is measured at the anesthesia machine with pressure transducers. The most commonly used transducer is the inexpensive, piezo-resistive transducer that relies on a pressure sensing diaphragm whose resistance changes when it is deformed in response to a differential pressure. The pressure transducers must be zeroed at the beginning of each day as part of the pre-use checkout. Inaccuracies or even failures may occur when humidity condenses in the pressure transducer tubing. Because the transducers are hidden in the machine, a leak in the breathing system because of a cracked transducer may not be obvious to the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gas flow &ndash;</strong> The two main methods for measurement of flow on contemporary anesthesia workstations are hot wire anemometers and variable orifice sensors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hot wire anemometers &mdash; Gas flows past and cools a thin wire that is heated to maintain a constant temperature. The heating current required is therefore related to gas flow.

An audible signal occurs if the limits are exceeded. Alarms can be changed manually according to clinical circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2202892236\"><span class=\"h2\">Circulatory system monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequacy of circulatory function is assessed by both clinical observation and physiologic monitors. Assessment of skin color and temperature, the quality of a palpable pulse, and heart tones via an esophageal or precordial stethoscope are valuable clinical parameters that must be supplemented by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiography, and in some cases, advanced cardiovascular monitoring. Urine output may also be used to assess organ perfusion.</p><p>Adequate lighting should be maintained in the operating room to allow observation of exposed body parts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3264395765\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate should be measured at least every five minutes during anesthesia, and more frequently as indicated clinically. In practice, heart rate is continuously monitored by electrocardiography and the pulse oximeter, and by the arterial pressure trace if invasive BP monitoring is used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2642296907\"><span class=\"h4\">Noninvasive blood pressure monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard device for intraoperative noninvasive BP monitoring is the automated oscillometric BP monitor. A sphygmomanometer should be available for situations in which an oscillometric reading cannot be obtained. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technology </strong>&ndash; Oscillometric BP devices operate by sensing the magnitude of oscillations in pressure caused by the blood flow. The cuff is inflated by a pump high enough to occlude arterial flow to the limb, and then released gradually, typically at approximately 2 to 4 mmHg per second [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A sensor in the device detects changes in oscillations, or amplitude of pressure pulses, created by the blood flow as the occlusion is released. Very faint blood flow oscillations begin to be detected as the pressure in the cuff coincides with systolic blood pressure (SBP). As pressure is released, the amplitude of pulsatile oscillations increases to a maximum that corresponds with mean arterial pressure (MAP), and ultimately levels off at a pressure that indicates diastolic pressure. Oscillometric BP devices are set to &quot;time out&quot; (ie, not display a reading) at 120 seconds if the measurement cannot be made. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cuff size and placement </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The proper cuff size should be used for the most accurate blood pressure measurement. The length of the cuff bladder should be 80 percent, and the width 46 percent of the circumference of the upper arm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Cuff size'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In most patients, this means that the cuff covers two-thirds of the distance between the elbow and shoulder. The cuff should be placed on the bare skin of the upper arm, snugly applied with the mid-bladder (sometimes marked) over the brachial artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When necessary, the blood pressure cuff can be placed on the forearm, ankle, calf, or thigh. The cuff size should be chosen as it would be for the arm (ie, related to the circumference of the limb). An ankle cuff should be placed as far distally as possible, with the mid-bladder just behind the medial malleolus. For measurement at the calf or thigh, the mid-bladder should be placed posteriorly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Accuracy &ndash; </strong>Systolic and diastolic blood pressures with oscillometric devices are calculated according to proprietary algorithms that vary by manufacturer, hence their accuracy depends on the algorithm used. Oscillometric methods tend to overestimate SBP and underestimate diastolic blood pressure (DBP), whereas they more accurately estimate mean arterial pressure (since this corresponds to a maximum amplitude of pulsatile oscillations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement is excellent over a wide range of blood pressures, its accuracy with very low or very high blood pressure remains questionable, compared with auscultatory and invasive arterial BP measurements. As examples, oscillometric automated measurements are consistently higher than ausculatory measurements in trauma patients with systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An analysis of 27,022 simultaneously measured invasive arterial and non-invasive BP (NIBP) pairs reported that in hypotensive states, the NIBP significantly overestimated the systolic blood pressure, and this difference increased as patients became more hypotensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Mean arterial blood pressures showed better agreement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Aside from errors intrinsic to the technology, the most common source of error with the use of non-invasive blood pressure measurement is an inappropriate cuff size. Cuffs that are too large produce erroneously low oscillometric readings, and cuffs that are too small produce higher readings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Cuff size'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other factors that may lead to errors or prevent measurement with a noninvasive blood pressure cuff include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any motion such as shivering, tremors, seizures, or arm flexion </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or frequent premature beats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Air leak, kink, or alteration of the cuff or tubing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapidly repeated cuff inflations, which can cause venous congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Blood pressure measured at other sites may not correlate with measurements in the upper arm. Studies of comparative measurements in the arm and ankle or calf have reported conflicting and widely variable results, and have been performed in heterogeneous patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. If the cuff must be placed on the leg, when possible a baseline measurement in the arm should be performed first for comparison. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure measurements with the cuff on the forearm tend to be higher than measurements in the upper arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient#H386870951\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Special equipment needs'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Blood pressure measurement should be corrected for patient position, particularly if the patient is placed in steep head up, steep head down, or sitting positions. Hydrostatic effects cause an increase in measurements in dependent limbs, and a decrease in measurements in elevated limbs. This difference may have important clinical implications. As an example, a patient in the sitting position with a normal mean arterial pressure measured in the arm may have unacceptably low mean arterial pressure in the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults#H400335488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient positioning for surgery and anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Physiologic effects of sitting position'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring &ndash; </strong>Several devices are available for continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring.

The slope becomes steeper as the waveform is measured further from the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The slope of this portion of the waveform varies with resistance in the arterial tree.

It is essentially the area under the curve during a single beat. MAP is often estimated mathematically as the sum of diastolic blood pressure plus one-third of the pulse pressure. This formula provides an estimate that is only valid at a heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures.

Peripheral waveforms have a higher systolic, lower diastolic, a lower and later dicrotic notch, and wider pulse pressure compared with aortic root pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>]. These changes are the result of the decreased diameter of peripheral blood vessels, their elasticity, and the reflection of the wave pattern from the vessel walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The systolic blood pressure in the radial artery can be 10 to 35 mmHg higher than that in the aorta, while diastolic and mean arterial pressures are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4128796511\"><span class=\"h5\">Transducer placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pressure transducer should usually be leveled to a point that corresponds with the level of the heart, aiming for 5 cm behind the sternum in a supine patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], or the mid-axillary line as an approximation. In the lateral decubitus position, the transducer should be leveled at the mid-sternum. Precise transducer placement is more important for measuring cardiac filling pressures than for arterial blood pressure. If the position of the operating table is changed during anesthesia, the level of the transducer should be adjusted. In some cases, the transducer should be leveled with the external auditory meatus, to reflect the pressure at the Circle of Willis and therefore brain perfusion.

Thus unnecessary lengths of tubing and extra stopcocks should be avoided. In addition to these issues, the arterial pressure waveform may become damped by air bubbles or clot in the arterial catheter, causing a characteristic (though sometimes subtle) tracing with a decrease in the displayed systolic pressure, and a falsely narrowed pulse pressure, though mean pressure is often accurate. Removal of air or flushing the catheter often resolves damping, or if necessary, the catheter must be replaced. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2833091405\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram should be monitored continuously during anesthesia. It is a reliable monitor for heart rate, rhythm, and the cardiac conduction system; the ability of the standard three or five lead ECG to detect intraoperative cardiac ischemia is limited. Abnormalities of the ECG may also provide evidence of electrolyte abnormalities. The components of the ECG and the basics of interpretation are discussed separately.

Instead, three or five leads are usually applied. Whenever possible, a five lead system should be used to display two channels and improve the sensitivity for detection of ischemia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Five-electrode system</strong> &ndash; The five-electrode system includes four extremity (ie, right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg) and one precordial electrode, and allows monitoring of seven leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and a single precordial lead). The desired precordial lead may be selected by placing the precordial electrode in any position from V1 to V6. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-electrical-components-of-the-ecg#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Electrical components of the ECG&quot;, section on 'Precordial leads'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For continuous ECG monitoring in the operating room (and in other parts of the hospital), the limb leads are typically placed on the torso. The arm leads are placed in the infraclavicular fossae close to the shoulders, and the left leg lead is placed below the rib cage in the anterior axillary line. The right leg electrode is a ground that can be placed anywhere, and is often placed on the right chest or abdomen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most monitors allow selection and display of multiple leads simultaneously. We usually select leads II and V5. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Three-electrode system</strong> &ndash; The three-electrode system allows monitoring along one bipolar lead between two electrodes while the third serves as a ground. Electrodes are placed in the infraclavicular fossae on left and right sides, and the left leg electrode is placed on the left side of the abdomen below the ribcage. Three leads may be individually selected with monitor controls. The three lead system can be used to monitor heart rate and to detect the existence of a p wave or presence of ventricular fibrillation, but cannot diagnose more complicated arrhythmias or conduction system abnormalities, for which a true V1 lead is required (eg, to distinguish between right and left bundle branch blocks). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The three lead system may be modified to approximate standard precordial leads by changing the standard electrode position. Such modification may be necessary if a five lead system is unavailable, or cannot be used because of the site of surgery, though the five lead system is the standard of care for ischemia monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A three-electrode ECG only allows for identification of ischemia and myocardial infarction in myocardial regions represented in the selected leads, and many perioperative ischemic events will be missed when using three electrode recordings. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Three modified leads can be used to monitor for anterior ischemia. For each of these leads, limb lead I is selected on the monitor, and the electrodes are placed as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CS5 &ndash; The right arm (RA) electrode is placed under the right clavicle, left arm (LA) electrode is placed in the V5 position, and the left leg (LL) electrode is placed anywhere on the left side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CM5 &ndash; The RA electrode is placed over the manubrium, the LA electrode is placed in the V5 position, and the LL electrode can be placed anywhere on the left.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CC5 &ndash; The RA electrode is placed in the mid-chest at the right anterior axillary line, the LA electrode is placed at the V5 locations, and the LL electrode is placed anywhere on the left. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CB5 &ndash; The RA electrode is placed over the center of the right scapula, the LA electrode is placed in the V5 position, and the LL electrode is placed anywhere on the right side. CB5 can be used to monitor for dysrhythmias, since it provides an obvious p wave.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The modified chest lead 1 (MCL1) provides p wave and QRS morphology adequate to detect some dysrhythmias. The LA electrode is placed below the left clavicle, the LL electrode is placed in the V2R to V3R location (ie, V2 and V3 on the right chest), and the RA electrode is placed anywhere on the right side. Limb lead III is selected on the monitor.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3838549536\"><span class=\"h4\">Ischemia detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For optimal detection of ischemia, more than one lead should be monitored, including an accurately placed precordial electrode. The changes visible on the ECG monitor may be subtle and difficult to quantify. Suspected ischemia should be confirmed with printout of a paper copy of the ECG trace, which is possible with most anesthesia monitors. Detailed perioperative ECG analysis should always be performed on ECG printouts because monitors do not provide grids for adequate analysis. In high risk patients, a baseline ECG strip should be printed prior to induction of anesthesia for later comparison if necessary.</p><p>Most intraoperative ischemia is manifested by ST depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. ECG criteria for diagnosing ischemia are discussed separately.

In addition, a lateral precordial lead should be monitored. In one study, high risk patients who underwent noncardiac surgery were monitored for ST segment changes with combinations of ECG leads, compared with continuous simultaneous 12 lead ECG monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Sensitivity for a single lead was highest for V5 (75 percent). The combination of lead II with V5 increased sensitivity for ischemia detection to 80 percent, and the sensitivity of three lead combinations was highest (96 percent) for leads II, V4, and V5. In another study, lead V4 was the most sensitive lead when monitored in isolation for detecting prolonged postoperative ischemia and infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ST segment analysis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Most anesthesia monitors now allow real-time ST segment analysis with trending. The default setting for ST segment analysis is usually for the device to measure deviation of the ST segment from isoelectric at 60 or 80 msec after the J point on the ECG trace (ie, J+60). Among the precordial leads (V3 to V5), monitoring the lead with the most isoelectric ST segment on the preoperative ECG may increase the utility of ST segment analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The measurement point, and the J Point, may be adjusted manually to improve accuracy of ST segment analysis for patients with abnormal ECGs. In patients without isoelectric ST segments, the alarm limits should be configured to account for the patient&rsquo;s baseline deviation. A number of conditions may affect the ST segment and reduce the utility of ST segment analysis for ischemia detection, such as left bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, hypokalemia, digitalis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3268790241\"><span class=\"h4\">Sources of ECG artifact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors can affect the ECG trace in the operating room. Some may be modified to improve the ECG trace, whereas others cannot. They include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrodes may lose contact with the skin because of inadequate skin preparation prior to placement, tension on the lead wire, or the surgical skin preparation solution, irrigant, or blood seeping under the lead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ECG baseline can wander because of shivering, tremor, respiration, or body movement associated with surgery. Baseline wandering may also be the result of poor electrode contact or electrode placement over bony prominences. Selecting a monitoring filter, rather than a diagnostic filter, on the ECG monitor may reduce wandering. (See <a href=\"#H1011880158\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring modes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ECG trace may be obliterated during electrosurgery.

Core temperature should be monitored intraoperatively whenever possible; the optimal monitoring site depends on the surgical procedure and type of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016416377\"><span class=\"h3\">Temperature monitoring sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Core temperature is monitored at highly perfused sites where temperature is homogeneous and high compared with the rest of the body, using nasopharyngeal (with probe inserted 10 to 20 cm), distal esophageal, tympanic membrane, or pulmonary artery probes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Nasopharyngeal or esophageal probes are used routinely during general anesthesia. </p><p>Alternative temperature monitoring sites may be required during some procedures (eg, oral or esophageal surgery), for patients who have regional anesthesia, or during general anesthesia with a face mask of supraglottic airway for airway management. Outside the United States, a double-sensor thermometer is applied to the forehead. Several studies have reported that this type of monitor correlates well with other methods of core temperature measurement during anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. </p><p>Axillary, bladder, and rectal temperature may reasonably estimate core temperature, though each site is subject to possible artifact. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axillary temperature is most accurate with the probe positioned over the axillary artery, and with the arm at the patient's side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In one study, a novel wireless temperature-monitoring device taped to shaved skin over the axillary artery closely approximated simultaneously-measured core temperature during general anesthesia for noncardiac surgery, with mean difference (esophageal minus axillary) of 0.14&ordm;C &plusmn; 0.26&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder temperature correlates with rectal temperature, and accuracy is affected by urine flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal temperature may accurately reflect core temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], but changes slowly during rapid changes in body temperature, and may not increase rapidly during malignant hyperthermia crises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Rectal temperature is rarely monitored because of the risk of rectal perforation with the probe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2444572952\"><span class=\"h3\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the temperature probes used in anesthesia for nasopharyngeal, esophageal, and axillary sites are thermistors, which are semiconductors whose electrical resistance decreases with temperature. They are usually coated with a smooth plastic layer to facilitate atraumatic insertion, and are disposable. Temperature probes embedded in Foley catheters are used to monitor bladder temperature.</p><p>Tympanic membrane probes are soft-tipped thermocouple devices that are inserted into the auditory canal to rest against the tympanic membrane. These devices are distinct from and much more accurate than tympanic membrane infrared scanners, and provide real time continuous measurement of core body temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The temporal artery and tympanic infrared scanners that are increasingly used in recovery areas are not sufficiently accurate for monitoring during anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/monitoring-during-anesthesia/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p>Temperature measurement during cardiopulmonary bypass is discussed separately.

Standard equipment monitors include measurement of end tidal carbon dioxide, inspired oxygen concentration, and the use of low oxygen concentration and ventilator disconnect alarms. (See <a href=\"#H2696495573\" class=\"local\">'Standards for monitoring during anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical monitoring using visual inspection, auscultation, and palpation is a primary determinant of patient safety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximeters provide an objective measure of oxygenation and display a plethysmographic waveform that is processed to determine heart rate. An inspired oxygen analyzer should be used during every anesthetic in which an anesthesia machine is used. (See <a href=\"#H3626630730\" class=\"local\">'Pulse oximetry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2019490258\" class=\"local\">'Inspired oxygen analyzer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilation during anesthesia is assessed clinically (ie, by observation of chest excursion, auscultation of breath sounds, movement of the reservoir bag), and by capnography. Capnography can be used to detect clinical changes (eg, small or large airway obstruction, intrinsic lung disease, or ventilatory effort) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> equipment malfunction (eg, breathing circuit leak, or kinked endotracheal tube). (See <a href=\"#H875814525\" class=\"local\">'Capnography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard device for intraoperative noninvasive blood pressure monitoring is the automated oscillometric blood pressure monitor. The most common source of measurement error is the use of an incorrectly sized cuff. The length of the cuff bladder should be 80 percent, and the width 46 percent of the circumference of the upper arm. (See <a href=\"#H2642296907\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive blood pressure monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct or invasive blood pressure monitoring may be used for anesthesia for high risk patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high risk surgical procedures. The pressure transducer used for invasive blood pressure monitoring should usually be leveled with the heart, and in some cases with the level of the brain. (See <a href=\"#H4128796511\" class=\"local\">'Transducer placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A five lead electrocardiogram is preferred during anesthesia. Leads II and V5 are usually monitored simultaneously to optimize detection of both rhythm and ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H2833091405\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary artery catheters, transesophageal echocardiography, and other noninvasive hemodynamic monitors may be used to monitor cardiovascular function in select patients. (See <a href=\"#H2717003433\" class=\"local\">'Other monitors of circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient temperature should be monitored during every anesthetic. Core temperature should be monitored whenever possible, using nasopharyngeal, distal esophageal, or less commonly tympanic membrane or pulmonary artery probes. When using an axillary temperature probe, the probe should be placed over the axillary artery with the arm kept at the patient&rsquo;s side for the most accurate measurement.
